=== Pandreo & Mauvier ===

[Mauvier]
...
[Pandreo]
Mind if I pray with you?
[Mauvier]
I fight alongside you, yet it does not mean my
faith in the holiness of the Fell Dragon is lost.
[Mauvier]
You are a cleric of the Divine Dragon. It would
be improper for us to pray beside one another.
[Pandreo]
We believe in different things, but we're both
men of the cloth. Why sweat the details?
[Mauvier]
"The details" are what bind us to our faith.
[Mauvier]
It is unconscionable that you would consider
your vows to be nothing more than "details."
[Pandreo]
Tell me something. What were you praying for
just now?
[Mauvier]
...
[Mauvier]
We live in an unhealthy world. Prayers for peace
are required.
[Pandreo]
Well, what do you know? I was about to pray
for the exact same thing.
[Pandreo]
The content of our prayers is the sameâ”€even if
the gods receiving them aren't.
[Mauvier]
Hm...
[Mauvier]
I have never met a cleric who thinks as you do.
[Pandreo]
Hahaha! Me neither.
[Mauvier]
Very well. You may pray next to me.
[Pandreo]
Good. Come on. If both of us pray for world
peace, they'll have to make it happen.

[Pandreo]
Hey, Mauvier. It's been a while. Want to grab
a bite somewhere?
[Mauvier]
No, thank you.
[Pandreo]
Oh, uh, OK. Got other plans?
[Mauvier]
No.
[Pandreo]
Then come on! You need to eat, don't you?
We can talk about things.
[Mauvier]
I have better ways to spend my day than
further discussion of our religious beliefs.
[Pandreo]
What if we discussed our hobbies or childhood
stories? The stuff normal people talk about.
[Mauvier]
...
[Mauvier]
You would waste time speaking of trivialities
when there is suffering in the world?
[Pandreo]
Last I checked, clerics are allowed to take
a break every now and then.
[Mauvier]
And while we rest, suffering continues. I must
remain dedicated to my cause.
[Pandreo]
Uh-huh... How about, just for a lark, you mix
things up today? Do things my way?
[Pandreo]
Come on. Those suffering people will still be
there in an hour, I promise.
[Mauvier]
...
[Mauvier]
Your humor lands on deaf ears, Pandreo. Still...
I will share a meal with you. This one time.
[Pandreo]
Huh! That was easier than I expected.
[Pandreo]
I know just the place. It's gonna be great.

[Pandreo]
So, what do you say? It was kinda nice to
relax and break bread together, wasn't it?
[Mauvier]
The company was, surprisingly, as wonderful
as the food.
[Mauvier]
I understand now how you think. It is important
to relax from time to time.
[Pandreo]
Didn't I tell you?
[Pandreo]
In that case, let's eat together tomorrow.
[Mauvier]
I am sorry, but no.
[Pandreo]
What? Why?
[Mauvier]
Because it is your turn to experience my
approach to life.
[Pandreo]
Huh?
[Mauvier]
I shall teach you the art of devoting yourself
entirely to helping others.
[Pandreo]
Well, you did try my way. I guess it's only fair
that I try your way.
[Pandreo]
Who knows. Maybe I'll learn something.
[Pandreo]
But after that, you'd better come eat with
me again.
[Mauvier]
I agreed to only the one meal.
[Pandreo]
Now I'm thinking we should switch off. My way
one day, your way the next...
[Mauvier]
And on and on forever.
[Pandreo]
Exactly! Now, let's join hands and pray again
for world peace.
[Mauvier]
Hah, you are persistent.
