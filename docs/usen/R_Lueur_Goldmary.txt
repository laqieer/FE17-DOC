[Goldmary] 
Was the meal to your satisfaction, Divine One?
[Alear] 
Oh yes, it was delicious. Thanks so much.
[Goldmary] 
Could you look me in the eyes, please?
[Alear] 
Uh, sure?
[Goldmary] 
Perfect. Keep on looking right at me.
[Goldmary] 
You have such an intense gaze... Tell me what 
you're feeling in this moment.
[Alear] 
Hmm... Nothing much, really...
[Goldmary] 
Have I stirred your heart so little?
[Goldmary] 
Let me ask you again. I'll whisper in your ear 
this time.
[Goldmary] 
Has your lunch with me today brought you any 
feelings of contentment?
[Alear] 
Oh, very much so.
[Goldmary] 
I knew it. I'm so glad. Tell me more about 
these feelings.
[Alear] 
Well... I'm so content I couldn't eat another 
bite. I'd be really curious to learn your recipe.
[Goldmary] 
My...recipe.
[Goldmary] 
Not exactly what I had in mind... But if that's 
really what you want, I'll teach you.

...
[Alear] 
Goldmary! Are you OK?
[Goldmary] 
Oh, Divine One... Did the sound of my soul in 
anguish finally get your attention? I'm so glad...
[Alear] 
What's wrong? Talk to me─I'm here to help.
[Goldmary] 
It's just that...I can't possibly be any 
more charming.
[Alear] 
Ah, what?
[Goldmary] 
Everyone always says I'm the most popular 
woman in the world...
[Goldmary] 
But if you're immune to my charms, I know that 
can't be true. My confidence is shattered...
[Goldmary] 
So here I stand... My tears flowing freely, like 
two rivers of glittering diamonds...
[Alear] 
Uh, look...
[Alear] 
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings somehow. 
I really didn't mean to.
[Goldmary] 
No, please don't apologize. Only tell me what 
I can do to earn your affection.
[Alear] 
You don't need to do anything special. 
I already think you're quite charming.
[Goldmary] 
You do? You think I'm charming?
[Alear] 
Of course. And it's not just me, you know. 
Everyone loves you.
[Alear] 
So don't feel like you have to push yourself 
so hard over this, OK?
[Goldmary] 
...
[Goldmary] 
WAAAH!
[Alear] 
What's wrong?!
[Goldmary] 
Nothing, nothing... I'm just so relieved.
[Goldmary] 
Thank you... As a token of my appreciation, you 
may admire my perfect tears a while longer.
[Alear] 
Um, OK. Thanks...

[Goldmary] 
Divine One, I must apologize for what happened 
last time we spoke.
[Goldmary] 
I was so overcome with joy, I actually made you 
stay with me until I was finished crying.
[Alear] 
That's all right. I'm just glad to see you 
feeling better.
[Goldmary] 
After it was over, I realized it would make more 
sense if you knew about my childhood.
[Alear] 
Oh, what about it?
[Goldmary] 
Everyone always fawned over me when I was 
young. So much so, in fact, it was all I knew.
[Goldmary] 
But in Elusia, when you reach a certain age, 
you have to leave home for the academy.
[Goldmary] 
For the first time, I had competitors. Others 
were more popular than me. I was devastated.
[Goldmary] 
I came to understand that some people can 
simply be better. I began to question everything.
[Alear] 
That must have been difficult.
[Goldmary] 
Since then, I've become a bit of a perfectionist. 
Being anything less than ideal is frustrating.
[Goldmary] 
But then you said you thought I was charming.
[Alear] 
And I stand by that. Somehow you always 
manage to be charming─even on the battlefield.
[Goldmary] 
Thank you. As soon as you said those words, 
I felt my confidence come flooding back.
[Goldmary] 
...
[Alear] 
Is this...good crying?
[Goldmary] 
Can't you tell by how these tears...glisten on my 
cheeks like the morning dew?
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, Divine One... I have such powerful 
feelings, it would be a crime to contain myself.
[Goldmary] 
You'll just have to admire this magnificence... 
to your heart's content...
[Alear] 
I'll remain by your side until you're finished.

[Goldmary] 
Thanks for meeting with me, Divine One. 
I took the liberty of setting a table for you.
[Alear] 
This is incredible. You made all this for me?
[Goldmary] 
I did. The presentation is rather plain by my 
usual standards, I have to admit.
[Goldmary] 
You might wonder why I'd go so far out of my 
way to prepare such an unremarkable dish.
[Goldmary] 
But this one has a special place in my heart.
[Goldmary] 
So in that sense, making it for you is an 
expression of my truest self.
[Alear] 
Thank you. That means a lot to me.
[Goldmary] 
I'm so glad.
[Goldmary] 
Divine One, if I may...
[Goldmary] 
There is something I'd like to say to you.
[Alear] 
What is it?
[Goldmary] 
Before, I might have hidden this by insisting 
you must have feelings for me.
[Goldmary] 
But that's beneath me now. Thanks to you, 
I'm confident enough to say how I feel.
[Goldmary] 
I'm falling in love with you, . 
More and more each day.
[Alear] 
You are?
[Goldmary] 
Please tell me you feel the same.
[Goldmary] 
Please tell me you think I'd make a perfect 
partner for you?
[Alear] 
Perfect?
[Alear] 
Hehe, ever the perfectionist, even now. I have 
to say, it's endearing.
[Alear] 
Forgive me if I'm a little speechless, Goldmary. 
Your confession took me by surprise.
[Alear] 
But I couldn't imagine a more perfect partner 
than you. So I want you to have this.
[Goldmary] 
The Pact Ring... I feel like I'm dreaming.
[Alear] 
You're not. Try it on.
[Goldmary] 
Ah, look! A perfect fit! And just the right match 
for these elegant hands.
[Alear] 
I couldn't agree more.
[Goldmary] 
Sweet of you to say. Now, shall we sit down 
and eat? Wouldn't want it to get cold.
[Alear] 
Great idea. Let's.
[Goldmary] 
I feel like I owe the people of the world an 
apology. No one else gets to be this happy.
[Goldmary] 
Actually, let's toast to that. Glasses up.
[Goldmary] 
Here's to us─the envy of the world. I want to 
be with you for the rest of my life.
