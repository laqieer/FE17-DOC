[Alear]
...
What was that? Was that me?

[Marth]
Are you all right? It looked as though you were
having a bad dream.
[Alear]
I was. But yes, I'm all right.
Were you here this whole time?
[Marth]
You were wearing my ring when you went
to bed.
[Alear]
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to take it off.
[Marth]
That's all right. Keep it on. Then if something
happens, I will be able to help.
Besides, after a millennium together, I would
feel uncomfortable if we were separated now.
[Alear]
Marth... What was I like?
[Marth]
Hmm...
[Alear]
You knew me back then. You must be able to
tell me something.
[Marth]
Well...
You were kind, as you are now. There's no need
to remember everything at once.
Take your time. Ease back into your memories.
Lumera advised that, too, didn't she?
[Alear]
Yes, she did. Sorry─I don't mean to
be impatient.
[Marth]
It's all right.
...
[Alear]
What was that?
[Marth]
I'm not sure. An enemy raid?
We had best take a look. I'm worried about
Lumera and the others.
[Alear]
Agreed.

[Alear]
Vander! Clanne! Framme!
[Vander]
Ah, Divine One! Thank goodness you're safe.
[Alear]
What's happening? Tell me.
[Framme]
Some enemies busted right through the castle
walls like paper. Suddenly, BAM! They're here!
[Clanne]
What's worse, they fought their way into the Ring Vault. If you
ask me, they're trying to get their hands on the Emblem Rings!
[Vander]
Even as we speak, Queen Lumera is defending
the vault.
[Vander]
Quickly! We must fly to her aid!
[Alear]
Sounds like a plan. Follow me!

[Alear]
Looks like we cleared the way. Let's get to the
Ring Vault!


Default


[Alear]
Whoever it is you are, the rest of your forces
have all been defeated.
So surrender now. If you refuse, I will stop you.
[Veyle]
Hm.
[Alear]
Ah! But how?!
[Veyle]
Do I detect a hint of fear? Of course I do.
[Alear]

No...
[Framme]
Here, Queen Lumera! I'll fix you up!

Huh?!
[Alear]
What's the matter?
[Framme]
My staff isn't helping her. She's hurt really bad, and...
It's her Divine Dragon powers─they're almost
totally wiped out!
[Alear]
...
[Framme]
A Divine Dragon losing their power... It's the same
as losing years of their life.
The thing is, there's no reason Queen Lumera should
be drained like this. It doesn't make any sense!
[Framme]

[Lumera]
It's simple, my young one... I gave my power
unto you.
[Alear]
But why?
[Lumera]
All the years you were sleeping...healing...I was
transferring my Divine Dragon powers to you.
I hoped it would be enough to bring you back to me someday.
But now, it would seem that I am completely spent.
[Alear]
Oh no, this is my fault! I did this!
[Lumera]
No, my dear... You have to push those thoughts away.
There is nothing a mother wouldn't do...to see
life return again...to her beloved child.
[Alear]
But I...
[Lumera]
This ring... It belongs to you now. The Ring of
the Holy Knight.
I had...so hoped to give you the ring I made,
as well...but that's not possible now...
Listen to me, child... Those who invaded here...
I sensed the power of the Fell Dragon within them.
[Alear]
...
[Lumera]
You must not allow them to capture any more of the rings.
Please...I beg of you... Gather together all 12 rings.
And...when your scattered memories return to you, you must
fight on with the utmost divinity. I believe in you, my child!
[Alear]
I understand. I'll collect the rings. I swear to you!
And I'll fight. I'll do whatever you want.
But please...don't leave me...
Mother!
[Lumera]
Ah... Ah, young one...how I've longed to hear
you call me that...
All those years...I held out hope. My heart
is fuller than you could ever know.
[Alear]
It can't end like this. You were going to give me that
ring once my memories came back... You promised!
And there...there are so many things you haven't
told me yet! You said that we would talk!
[Lumera]
I did... There's still so much I wanted to say to you...
Being your mother─becoming your mother─
has brought so much happiness into my life.
[Alear]
I know...and I'm happy to be your child, in this moment─
here and now─and a thousand years ago. I am.
Don't go... Stay with me until I remember again!
Please, Mother─I need more time!
[Lumera]
Haha... Oh, my sweet one.
Now. Let's make a promise... Mother and child.
We'll make it a pinky promise. I swear to you...
I'll be with you always and forever.
And the ring, remember... Once you've rested...
we will talk...
You and I...

[Alear]
Mother...
[Lumera]
[Lumera]

[Alear]
No! Please!

[Vander]
This simply cannot have happened...
Queen Lumera...
[Vander]
[Alfred]
The Divine Dragon Queen... She has left us.
[Alfred]

[Alear]
Mother, please wake up...
You promised you'd stay by my side... You have
to... You have to keep your promise!





[Alear]
Thank you for helping with my mother's funeral.
[Vander]
It was the final service we could provide
Queen Lumera as stewards.
[Vander]
[Framme]
I can't believe she's gone.
[Clanne]
C'mon, Framme. Think how hard this must be
on the Divine Dragon. We gotta hold it together.
[Framme]
I'm trying, but...
[Framme]
[Clanne]

[Marth]
...
Lumera. I never thought our paths would
diverge so soon.
[Sigurd]
Nor I. And to leave a child behind. I did that
in death... A bitter memory.
I vow to protect your offspring in your
absence, Lumera.
[Marth]
If we could grant our power now...
[Sigurd]
Marth. You know that's not possible without the
other Emblems here.
[Marth]
Yes, yes, I know.
[Marth]

[Sigurd]

[Alfred]
This is awful. Sorry I couldn't have
done...something.

[Vander]
No, Prince Alfred. Without you, our losses may
have been even greater.
Though I must ask, why did you come?
Was there something you needed?
[Vander]
[Alfred]
Our kingdom is in danger. My mother sent me
to ask Queen Lumera for help.
All over Firene, our people are being attacked
by these...these...creatures.
[Alear]
Creatures? What kind of creatures?
[Alfred]
These things are like people, but...cracked,
almost crumbling.
[Alear]
The Corrupted.
[Alfred]
Oh, so that's what you call them.
[Alear]
Yes. Corpses brought back to life.
[Alfred]
No wonder they wouldn't listen to us. They just
keep attacking everything.
We sent our knights out to hold them off, but
it's a losing battle.
My kingdom is being destroyed.
Divine One...will you help us?
Please, come with me to Firene.
[Alear]
Me? What can I do? It was my mother's help
you wanted, not mine.
[Alfred]
Queen Lumera is gone. You're the last
Divine Dragon.
We need the power of the rings to save Firene.
And only you can do that.
[Alear]
...
[Alfred]
Sorry. I don't mean to press the topic.
I'll return to Firene. We'll...do what we can.
[Alear]
I'm coming with you.
[Alfred]
You will?!
[Alear]
I don't want more families to be torn apart─
more people to suffer.
Even if I'm scared, I have to push through
my fear.
Now that my mother is gone, it's my duty to
step into the role of Divine Dragon.
And if each kingdom is protecting rings, I take it
Firene has one, correct?
[Alfred]
That's right.
[Alear]
Then I need to go there anyway to honor my
mother's request.
She asked me to gather all of the rings and
bring peace back to Elyos.
As the Divine Dragon, I officially accept the
kingdom of Firene's request for aid.
[Alfred]
That's great to hear! Thank you, Divine One.
[Alear]
Happy to help, Prince Alfred.
[Alfred]
Just "Alfred" is fine. I've been visiting you at the
Somniel since I was a boy.
I think of you as...an old friend. A very, very
old friend.
[Alear]
I appreciate that. Actually, I can't remember
anything from before I fell asleep.
[Alfred]
Nothing?
[Alear]
This world is new to me. I appreciate having
friends who can teach me about it.
[Alfred]
I'll do my best.
Can't say I'll know much compared to Queen
Lumera, but I'll try.
[Alear]
Thank you, Alfred.




[Vander]
We ought to establish a base of operations
before we begin our journey.
The Somniel would be uniquely useful.
[Alear]
A little out of the way, isn't it?
I can't imagine how we'd get everyone there
and back.
[Vander]
As a Divine Dragon, you can travel there no
matter where you are in the world.
[Alear]
I can?
[Vander]
Indeed. Furthermore, one can only enter the
Somniel with a Divine Dragon's power.
Without Queen Lumera's blessing, even we
stewards couldn't have set foot there.
That is what makes it a safe haven.
[Alear]
Well then, yes. Let's use it as our base.
But before we depart, can you give me
a moment?
[Vander]
Hm?
[Alear]
We'll be gone a while, so...I'd like to say
goodbye to my mother.
[Vander]
Of course. Take as much time as you need.
[Vander]

[Alear]
...
Thank you for watching over me all this time.
This journey will be a long one, but don't worry.
Vander and the others will be right beside me.
I will fulfill my duty as the Divine Dragon. I will
find all of the rings, just as you asked.
And then I'll return to you, Mother. I promise.




[Alear]
Here we are, safely returned to the Somniel.
I didn't realize how...spacious this place was.
[Vander]
It is rather quiet, I know. But it will liven up
as we gain allies.
We may need someone to supply us with
equipment as well. Something to consider.
[Alear]
Right.
[Vander]
Oh, by the way, Divine One. Might this
be yours?
[Alear]
Hm? A piece of jewelry... I don't recognize it.
The crystal looks unusual.
Where did you get this?
[Vander]
On the ground in the Ring Vault, after the siege.
I thought it might be yours, but apparently
I was mistaken.
No one has come forward, so it must have
belonged to an enemy soldier. I'll dispose of it.
[Alear]
Wait.
It's familiar somehow, even though I've never
seen it.
[Vander]
Then please, do take it. Perhaps it will help
jog your memory.
[Alear]
Thank you, Vander.
Once we've rested for a bit, let's set out
for Firene.


--- EV ---


[Alear]
There are too many of them. We'll never make
it to the Ring Vault...
( [Alfred]
[Alfred]
Through this door, right?
[Alfred]




[Etie]

[Etie]
Yes. This is the one.
[Etie]




[Boucheron]

[Boucheron]
Then let's go.
[Boucheron]

[Alear]
I hear voices. Someone's coming.


[Alear]
Prince Alfred of...Firene, you said?
[Alfred]
Could it be? Are you the Divine
Dragon ?
You finally woke up?!

[Alear]
I did, yes.
[Alfred]
That's amazing! You know, I've waited ages for
this to happen.
There's so much to talk about. Later, of course.
After we've taken care of these scoundrels.
Who are they, anyway?

[Alear]
We're not sure. They attacked so suddenly.
[Alfred]
Well, let's do this quickly─pin down whoever's
in charge and get some answers.
Oh, these are my retainers, Etie and Boucheron.
From now on, consider us at your disposal.
Lead the way, Divine One!

[Alear]
Thank you for your help.



[Boucheron]
Sorry, Divine One─I didn't have a chance to
introduce myself. My name's Boucheron.
If I'm near an enemy you're fighting, I can jump
in and land another hit on them.
Call on me if you need some extra oomph.



[Etie]
It's an honor to meet you, Divine One. I'm Etie.



[Etie]
My arrows are perfect for knocking airborne
enemies out of the sky.
With these muscles, I'll have those fliers
dropping like flies!


--- MOVIE ---

[Lumera]
Why are...you here alone?
[Alear]
Hehe...

[Alfred]
Made it! And not a moment too soon...
The Crown Prince Alfred of Firene is here to help.
Let me at 'em!

Time to die.
Look out!
Ah!
Now, why don't you hand the rings over to me.
Leave here at once!
Hm.

I have my orders. No one reaches the vault.


[Alear]
Who are you, and what do you want?
" [Elusian Soldier] * [Elusian Soldier] [Elusian Soldier] [Boss]
I am here to fight, not exchange words.
