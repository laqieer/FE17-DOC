[Timerra]
Hey, Jade! Got a sec?
[Jade]
Certainly, Princess Timerra. What do you need?
[Timerra]
I hear that you're from a mining town, so you
know a lot about minerals and stuff.
[Jade]
That's right. My father was a gemologist, so I
picked up a fair bit of knowledge.
[Timerra]
Perfect! Seeing as you're such an expert, want
to go mineral hunting with me?
[Jade]
You're going mineral hunting?
[Timerra]
Yup!
[Timerra]
See, I'm on the hunt for a big, fabulous
jewel-to-be.
[Timerra]
I already have a place in mind, but I'm not sure
how to go about finding a gem there.
[Jade]
Ah, I understand why you came to me.
[Jade]
I wouldn't mind joining you, but...if you're
interested in jewels, why not visit a jeweler?
[Jade]
You are royalty, after all. I'm sure they'd sell
you as many rare stones as you want.
[Timerra]
Yeah, but that's no fun.
[Timerra]
I'd much rather find one for myself. You know,
do it the old-fashioned way!
[Jade]
I see. That's a rare perspective.
[Jade]
Well if that's the plan, I'll be happy to
guide you.
[Jade]
I'll take a few notes along the way. I might be
able to mine some ideas for my next novel.
[Timerra]
Perfect! I get a dazzling jewel, and you get a
dazzling protagonist. Win, win!

[Timerra]
Welp, the mineral hunt came up empty.
[Jade]
Sorry, Princess Timerra. I did worry we might
walk away empty-handed.
[Timerra]
Nah, don't sweat it. It was still fun exploring
the mine with you.
[Timerra]
Honestly, if you've got time, I'd love to give it
another try someday soon.
[Jade]
Of course. I'll accompany you as many times
as you'd like.
[Timerra]
Hey, here's an idea.
[Timerra]
If we get a big chunk of mineral, let's polish it
up nice and cut it into two matching jewels!
[Timerra]
That way, you and me have sparkling mementos
for our friendship. Great idea, huh?
[Jade]
A jewel for me? I feel like that would be a bit
of a waste, to be honest.
[Timerra]
Huh? What do you mean?
[Timerra]
Now that I think about it...you don't really wear
jewels, huh?
[Jade]
No, I don't.
[Jade]
For me, jewels aren't something to be worn.
They're something to protect.
[Jade]
I used to be a guard at my hometown's local
mine. Bandits were a constant nuisance.
[Jade]
That's why I wouldn't be able to enjoy wearing
one. My instinct would be to lock it away.
[Timerra]
Wow. "Waste" is right.
[Jade]
Yes, exactly. I'm glad you understand.
[Timerra]
No! What I mean is, it's a waste for such a
beauty not to wear jewels!
[Timerra]
That settles it. We're going to march back there
and get the prettiest gems you ever saw.
[Timerra]
And so help me, you're gonna wear yours!

ミスティラI can't believe we still couldn't find
any minerals.
[Jade]
Indeed. All of the local mines seem to
be exhausted...
[Jade]
If we'd gotten there a bit sooner, we might have
found something...but it's hard to say.
[Timerra]
Guh...I just want a couple of jewels. Is that so
much to ask?
[Timerra]
I got so pumped about you wearing one. Bet it
would have looked great.
[Jade]
...
[Jade]
Hm.
[Timerra]
Hey, are you laughing?!
[Jade]
I am.
[Jade]
Not at anything in particular. I'm just happy.
[Timerra]
About what?
[Jade]
I'm happy that you're thinking of me like this.
[Jade]
You said you wanted to find jewels for yourself,
but now you're focused on finding one for me.
[Jade]
I'm just taking a moment to...enjoy the feeling.
[Timerra]
Hey, hey! Look at you, getting all mushy on me.
[Timerra]
I just think you deserve some extra beauty in
your life, you know?
[Jade]
I appreciate that very much, Princess Timerra.
[Timerra]
Ugh...
[Timerra]
Nope, not letting it end like this. Come on, we're
going to a jeweler right now!
[Jade]
Huh? You're just going to buy jewels now?
After all of our searching?
[Jade]
Heh.
[Timerra]
Hehe, yup. I've officially given up on the
old-fashioned way. Is that bad?
[Jade]
Not at all. Besides, we didn't need to find a rare
gem. I've been standing beside one all along.
