[Vander]
...
[Vander]
Nothing like a bit of knitting to properly relax.


[Saphir]
Oh, Vander! Didn't expect to see you doing
some, uh...needlework?
[Vander]
Oh, Saphir.
[Vander]
Not so loud, please. This is a delicate project.
I am likely to bungle it if you startle me.
[Saphir]
Right. Sorry.
[Saphir]
Guess I was just surprised to see you knitting,
of all things. Hobby of yours?
[Vander]
Yes. And how is it surprising? Do you lack any
hobbies of your own?
[Saphir]
I'm a simple knight, through and through.
Combat training is all I need.
[Vander]
Always more to learn there. But this skill can be
useful on the battlefield as well.
[Saphir]
Yeah? How do you figure?
[Vander]
Knitting demands that you learn movements
requiring finesse, mastering them by repetition.
[Vander]
Taking shortcuts also leads to sloppy results.
[Vander]
The same could be said of the skills we train
for combat, wouldn't you say?
[Saphir]
OK, I see what you're getting at, and you might
have a point there.
[Vander]
Are you interested in learning the craft, then?
[Saphir]
Why not? Sure.
[Vander]
Excellent. I will be happy to teach you what
I know. I think you will find it most fulfilling.

[Vander]
You dropped a stitch, Saphir.
[Saphir]
Ugh... Yeah, of course I did. Stupid tiny loops
can't sit still for half a second...
[Vander]
Easy, now. Slow down or you will find yourself
with a tangled mess.
[Saphir]
We're way past that. It looks like an old fishnet
that washed ashore.
[Vander]
Hmm... Yes, I see. You will need to rip out those
last few stitches and do them over.
[Saphir]
Really?! You think?! Ugh... I can't do this.
[Vander]
Fear not, this only practice. A clumsy mistake
is but a learning experience.
[Saphir]
Clumsy! Yeah, because I'm SO... Ugh. I'm sorry,
Vander. Knitting's not for me.
[Saphir]
I appreciate you taking the time, but I'm not cut
out for this kind of thing.
[Vander]
Is that so? I am surprised to see a knight of
Brodia surrender at the first sign of trouble.
[Vander]
The warriors of Brodia are famed for their
resolve. Perhaps that reputation is misleading.
[Saphir]
Uh-huh.
[Saphir]
Trying to get a rise out of me? Doesn't suit you.
Stick to the delicate stuff.
[Saphir]
You're right, though, about Brodian knights.
We never quit, and I'm not about to start.
[Vander]
Perhaps I have been too hard on you. I will be
more gentle in my instruction from now on.
[Saphir]
No, no. You've done more than enough.
I'll handle the rest on my own.
[Saphir]
I'm gonna knit so hard it pops your pauldrons.
You just stand back and wait to be impressed.
[Vander]
Very well. I eagerly await your results.

[Saphir]
Vander! My knitting project's all done!
[Vander]
Finally finished, have you?
[Saphir]
It's just a little drawstring pouch, but...came out
pretty good, didn't it?
[Vander]
Hmm... Stitches are straight, loops consistent...
This is well made.
[Vander]
Clearly the result of your hard work and
determination. Fantastically done.
[Saphir]
I have to say, once I got into a rhythm with it,
knitting was...really calming. Like meditation.
[Saphir]
I get what you meant nowâ”€about how you see
this like another kind of training.
[Saphir]
I'm grateful to you for teaching me, Vander.
To show my appreciation...I made you this.
[Saphir]
Nothing too fancy. Just a little something extra
I threw together.
[Vander]
Ah, a scarf!
[Vander]
The pouch was excellent on its own, but to
make this too, and so quickly... I'm impressed.
[Saphir]
Brodian knights hate to quit, but we love to
learn. Gotta put in the work to be the best.
[Vander]
I see. However, you should know that, good as
you are, you will not surpass my skill easily!
[Saphir]
I've got a long way to go for that, I know.
[Vander]
In all seriousness, perhaps you and I should
train together.
[Saphir]
Train?
[Vander]
I will teach you more about knitting, and you
will show me some of your combat techniques.
[Saphir]
Now you're speakin' my language!
[Saphir]
Yeah, I'd love that. I'm sure there's a lot we can
learn from each other!
