[Chloé] 
Oh, hello, Princess Céline! You look radiant 
as ever.
[Céline] 
Thank you, Chloé.
[Chloé] 
We have some free time today. How do you 
intend to spend it?
[Céline] 
That's a good question.
[Céline] 
Why don't we take a ride on your pegasus to 
a nearby tea farm?
[Chloé] 
I'd be thrilled!
[Céline] 
Mind you, we don't have that much free time. 
I doubt it would be like it was before.
[Céline] 
If only I could return to those days of whiling 
away the hours with you...
[Chloé] 
Princess Céline?
[Céline] 
Oh well. Let's do something else.
[Chloé] 
When this war ends, I'll take you wherever you 
like, as often as you like.
[Chloé] 
We'll visit all the tea farms in the world.
[Chloé] 
And we can pass the time taking in beautiful 
landscapes while sipping delicious tea.
[Chloé] 
Now, doesn't that sound lovely?
[Céline] 
It does indeed. Wonderful idea, Chloé.
[Céline] 
I shall hold you to it when the time comes.
[Chloé] 
And I will be happy to oblige.

[Céline] 
Heh heh. Hm-hm.
[Chloé] 
My goodness. Is my face so funny that you'd 
laugh as soon as you see it?
[Céline] 
Forgive me, Chloé. Though, I wasn't laughing 
at you.
[Céline] 
Rather, it was the memory of the first time we 
met that has me so amused.
[Chloé] 
Oh yes, how could I forget? My first encounter 
with the princess...
[Chloé] 
You were at the harbor with your face 
scrunched up in tears. It was adorable.
[Céline] 
I wouldn't say I was in tears!
[Céline] 
The ship I meant to board couldn't set sail, 
and I was grasping at straws. That's all.
[Chloé] 
Which is when I made my entrance.
[Chloé] 
I told you if there was someplace you wanted 
to go, I could give you a ride on my pegasus.
[Céline] 
And off we went to the tea farm.
[Céline] 
I'd snuck out of the castle incognito before, 
but this was something altogether different.
[Céline] 
I'd never ridden a pegasus. I can remember my 
excitement like it was yesterday!
[Céline] 
The first of many grand adventures.
[Chloé] 
That day is burned into my memory forever.
[Chloé] 
When they told me you were the princess, 
I nearly keeled over with shock.
[Chloé] 
I mean, how many people make friends with a 
girl who turns out to be royalty?
[Céline] 
Heh heh, I'm sorry. I hope it wasn't too hard on 
your nerves.
[Chloé] 
Oh, it was an honor. Like I was living a real 
fairy tale!
[Chloé] 
You might say I started a new life that day.
[Céline] 
Indeed? You must elaborate.
[Chloé] 
Oh, I'd be happy to. But not today.
[Céline] 
No? I have the time, if that's your concern.
[Chloé] 
Hmm-hm! Oh, Princess Céline. The best fairy 
tales leave the audience wanting more.

[Chloé] 
The day we met was a fateful one for me.
[Chloé] 
Ever since, I've kept watch for things that just 
don't happen in real life.
[Céline] 
Whatever do you mean by that?
[Chloé] 
Until I met you, I led exactly the kind of life 
you'd expect.
[Chloé] 
I'd fantasize about things that might happen in 
stories, but I knew it was just a fantasy.
[Chloé] 
But the day I met you was the day I found 
myself living in a fairy tale instead.
[Chloé] 
And if it could be true for that one day, why 
couldn't it be true all the time?
[Céline] 
You certainly have bravery enough to be a fairy- 
tale heroine, Chloé.
[Chloé] 
Oh, Princess Céline. You don't have to 
flatter me.
[Céline] 
Haha, it was no mere flattery, only the truth.
[Céline] 
But you were saying that our meeting started 
a new life for you?
[Chloé] 
Yes.
[Chloé] 
That day, I made up my mind to do whatever it 
took to become your knight.
[Céline] 
Why is that?
[Chloé] 
Well, it seemed to me that becoming a knight 
was the only way for me to live my own life.
[Chloé] 
Rather than the one dictated by my parents─or 
by my birth.
[Chloé] 
That day was the turning point, when I began 
my training.
[Céline] 
I remember how startled I was to hear that you 
would be my retainer.
[Chloé] 
Hmm-hm, I bet.
[Chloé] 
Now imagine how my family felt about it.
[Chloé] 
It's no exaggeration to say that meeting you 
changed my life.
[Céline] 
Oh, Chloé...
[Céline] 
I could say the same for you.
[Céline] 
You are a precious friend and a thoroughly 
dependable retainer.
[Céline] 
It has been a joy to have you near. Thank you 
for your service, Chloé.
[Céline] 
I look forward to seeing the rest of the fairy tale 
that we weave together.
[Chloé] 
Me too, Céline.
