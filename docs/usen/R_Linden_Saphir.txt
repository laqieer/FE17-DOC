=== Lindon & Saphir ===
--- C ---




[Saphir]
Excuse me, Lindon. Do you mind if I ask you
a bit of an odd question?
[Lindon]
Ask away, Saphir.
[Saphir]
Well...
[Saphir]
Actually, uh, never mind. Forget I said anything.
[Lindon]
Hmm. You seemed quite solemn about it,
whatever it was.
[Lindon]
There was pain there as well. As though
something weighs heavily on your heart.
[Lindon]
I think you should go ahead and come out
with it.
[Saphir]
OK.
[Saphir]
About 30 years ago... You'd already begun
your career as a soldier of Elusia, right?
[Lindon]
Indeed, I had.
[Lindon]
I joined as a royal soldier almost immediately
upon graduating Elusia's national academy.
[Saphir]
You must have taken part in campaigns
against Brodia around that time, then.
[Lindon]
Yes... Yes, I did.
[Saphir]
If I were to name a town or a village in Brodia...
Would you remember if...
[Saphir]
No, this is inappropriate. I shouldn't be asking.
[Lindon]
Saphir, I, er...
[Saphir]
I'm sorry to bother you. I hope I didn't offend.
[Saphir]

[Lindon]
Well, now. This bears some looking into.

[Lindon]
Saphir, may I speak to you for a moment?
[Saphir]
Of course, Lindon. What is it?
[Lindon]
Your guess that I was an Elusian soldier about
30 years ago was correct.
[Lindon]
That said, my tour of duty never brought me to
any rural fishing villages.
[Saphir]
You looked into this─into where I'm from.
[Lindon]
Indeed.
[Saphir]
All right. I'll say it.
[Saphir]
Elusia attacked my home village 30 years ago.
A lot of folks were killed...my parents included.
[Saphir]
It's not that I'm on a revenge quest or anything.
I haven't been searching for their killers.
[Saphir]
But if you were a soldier in Elusia at that time...
I couldn't help but wonder...
[Lindon]
No, no, your suspicions are only natural. I would
wonder the same thing in your shoes.
[Saphir]
I still shouldn't have asked. We're on the same
side now. There's no need to dig this up.
[Lindon]
If you want to hate me, Saphir, you have
the right.
[Lindon]
Even if you wanted me dead, I'd allow it if it
would ease your pain.
[Saphir]
What?! Why would you say that?!
[Lindon]
Because I mean it.
[Lindon]
I may not have done any harm to your parents
personally, but I was a soldier in that war.
[Lindon]
I can easily see a world in which it was I who
ended your parents' lives.
[Saphir]
I...
[Lindon]
I am a man long past his prime. I'd happily go to
my end if it would bring you relief.
[Lindon]
And although words can change nothing now...
I do apologize. I am truly, profoundly sorry.
[Saphir]
I can't do this. Excuse me.
[Saphir]

[Lindon]
Oh dear...

[Saphir]
Now that is how you fillet a fish.


[Lindon]
I must say, you handle a fillet knife splendidly.
[Saphir]
Lindon...
[Lindon]
It's quite something to see such a large fish
gutted and cleaned in a matter of moments.
[Saphir]
No, not really. Any kid growing up near the
water can do the same by about seven.
[Lindon]
I see.
[Lindon]
Saphir, about our last conversation...
[Saphir]
Anyway, you've got perfect timing!
[Saphir]
I was just about to sear this fish. Wanna lend
me your magic touch? C'mon, do the honors!
[Lindon]
Er, I would be glad to, but...
[Saphir]
Our earlier conversation's weighing on you.
[Lindon]
I'm afraid so.
[Lindon]
I cannot deny that I took part in the war that
cost your parents their lives.
[Lindon]
I would understand completely if you held
a grudge against me.
[Saphir]
With all due respect, Lindon...drop this before
I lose my cool.
[Lindon]
I'm sorry?!
[Saphir]
My problem isn't with you. It's with the war.
[Saphir]
If I held grudges against everyone involved, it'd
never end. I've seen enough to understand that.
[Lindon]
I suppose, but...
[Saphir]
I mean it. You're not doing me any favors
taking on that burden.
[Lindon]
You're right. I see now that I was being
entirely foolish.
[Saphir]
Not entirely. You've shown you care. That
means something.
[Saphir]
Now, are you gonna sear this fish for me
or what? We've got hungry folks waiting!
[Lindon]
Then there's no time to waste! No more
apologies─I've got bigger fish to fry!
