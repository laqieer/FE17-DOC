So, this is it...the altar of the Divine Dragon.


This is where you slept? All that time?
Ah... If only I'd known you were here sooner.
No, it wouldn't have mattered.
Even if I had come long ago, I never would have 
been allowed to see you.


Oh, good morning.
I'm proud of who I've become.
But it never would have happened if I hadn't 
fought for it.
It wasn't easy.
Being here right now...it was all worth it!


Good morning.
I wonder, is this the way you looked?
The day you woke up, I mean.
I wish I could have been there to see your 
eyes open.


--- C2 ---

Have you ever pretended you couldn't 
wake up?
You know, just so people would come talk 
to you while you slept?


Hmm... Could that be what you're doing 
right now?
Or maybe you're just sound asleep.
I know what it's like to fall into a deep, 
deep sleep.
I am a dragon, after all.
Still, it's time for you to rise and shine!


Good morning!
How do you feel?
I hope you're rested and refreshed.
Because your little sister is here!
And she's ready to talk to you about everything!


Hehe, did I guess right?
It's OK. I once pretended I couldn't be 
woken up...
just so people would come share their thoughts 
with me.
Hmm, what thoughts should I share with you?

The altar of the Divine Dragon and the altar of 
the Fell Dragon...they're just so...different.


The altar I slept on was in a dark place.
Almost no sunlight got in.
There were candles here and there, and they 
flickered in the dark.
That was pretty.


Hehe, I think I'm getting a bit nostalgic.
Though I don't ever want to go back there.
Forget the dark...
I want to live in the light.


Oh, you're awake.
I was just thinking about the altar I used to 
sleep on.
How did I like it? Well...
It was a lot different than yours.


--- B2 ---

I dreamed about the broken dragonstone.
I was afraid something happened to you.


Ah... You're sound asleep. What a relief that is.
I wonder if it was my own dragonstone I saw in 
my dream?
I decided I didn't ever want to turn into a 
dragon, so I buried it.


I'm sorry. I woke you!
It's true, I don't have my own 
dragonstone anymore.
And I don't regret it.
I don't need to be a big dragon.
I have the power I need right here.


Ah... It's such a relief knowing you're all right.
Hehe, I was worried sick before, but now I'm 
actually a little hungry!
I hope you don't mind, but I've got to find 
something spicy to eat.

Even when it's dark outside, it's bright in here. 
The stars light everything up.


They say you become a star in the sky 
when you die.
I wonder...are Mama and Marni and the others 
up there somewhere?
And what about the other me? Maybe...maybe 
she's a pretty star too.


Sorry I woke you up.
Please let me stay a little longer.
I've slept on an altar before...
but I've never ever prayed on one.
I just hope a Fell Dragon's prayers can be 
heard from here.


Did I wake you? I'm sorry.
It's just...I had a bad dream.
Please, can I stay here a little longer?
Hehe, thank you. You're very kind.


--- A2 ---

Ah...
I love getting to see you whenever I want.


Thank you for letting me tell you how I felt 
about Papa the other day.
It's hard, but I'm finally ready to break that 
bond I had with him.
I'll do it with my own hands too.


Good morning.
I feel like we're just normal siblings when we're 
together like this.
I suppose I don't know what "normal" 
even means.
But I want to figure that out with you.


I spent so long wishing I could see you and 
spend time with you.
Part of me wants the same with Papa.
No, I used to want that...
But that wish...that dream...is gone.


--- S1 ---

It's morning! I know you're sleepy, but...
you can't save the world if you don't wake up!


Sheesh, you're taking forever to wake up.
But it doesn't matter. I'm here. You're here. 
And we're a real family now.
When we're together like this, I just know I'll 
never lose you like I did before.
The Pact Ring won't shatter, not like your 
dragonstone did.
And anyway, as your little sister...
I'm going to make sure I protect you!


Finally! You woke up!
Time to get going.
We have to get to the portal that leads to 
the other worlds.
And when we get there, we're going to 
stop Papa...
no matter what.


Good morning!
It's funny. I've been waking up feeling really 
good lately, hehe!
Now, if I could ever get you out of bed...
I'm sure we could accomplish anything!


--- S2 ---

Your sister's here to wake you up!
"Your sister" Ooo, I love getting to say 
that, hehe.


So, you're keeping the stone I gave you here.
I wonder if you'll be able to use it one day.
Maybe it could help you become a snow 
white dragon, just like Lumera.
I want to be a righteous dragon one day.
No...I will become one.
My soul has changed even if my blood hasn't.
It was you who taught me that.


Morning!
I have an idea. Next time, you should come 
wake me up!
It'd be really easy, you know.
I'd be so happy to see you, I'd jump right 
out of bed!


I'm sorry for this silly grin.
I'm just so happy!
I've found my sibling, my best friend... 
my family!
Thanks for giving me so many reasons to smile.
