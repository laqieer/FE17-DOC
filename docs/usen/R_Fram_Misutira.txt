[Framme]
This top is so cute, I can't even handle it.
Ooh, and that red skirt is really chic!
[Framme]
Oh no. This place has accessories too? Well,
goodbye, money. It was nice knowing you.
[Timerra]
Tell me about it. I have to stop myself from
snapping up everything in the store.
[Framme]
Princess Timerra! What are you doing here?
[Timerra]
Shopping. Why? Is that weird?
[Framme]
Oh, uh, no! I just would have assumed you had
people to do that for you.
[Timerra]
I like to go shopping on my own. Incognito.
That way I can try on clothes, see what fits.
[Framme]
Wow, I love that! It's almost like you're a
real person.
[Timerra]
Hehe! Hehe, thanks! I think!
[Timerra]
Gotta say, Framme. You've got style.
[Timerra]
Your color scheme is elegant, yet eye-catching.
The ribbons add a touch of flair.
[Timerra]
And don't get me started on that skirt.
It's completely, unequivocally you!
[Framme]
You really think so? I'm honored.
[Framme]
I spent a long time on this look. Took me a
while to nail down the right ensemble.
[Timerra]
Trust me, I know the feeling. It's hard to find a
perfect balance between form and function.
[Framme]
Exactly! I want something that's both practical
and cute as heck. Is that so much to ask?
[Timerra]
Hehe, you're speaking my language.
[Framme]
I can't believe I'm talking fashion with Princess
Timerra! It's like a dream come true.
[Timerra]
Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't you pick out
clothes for me some time?
[Framme]
Really? Really?! REALLY?
[Timerra]
Really. And I'll pick something out for you too.
We'll get all dressed up!
[Framme]
That sounds so fun!
[Timerra]
It's settled, then!
[Framme]
I can't wait to put together the perfect outfit
for you.

[Timerra]
♪Stylish clothes for you and me!
It's like furniture for your body!♪
[Framme]
That's a fun song, Princess Timerra.
[Timerra]
That's 'cause I'm having fun! It's exciting to
pick out someone else's clothes for a change.
[Timerra]
Got yours ready to go?
[Framme]
Yup! I'm all set.
[Timerra]
Me too! OK, without any further ado...
Show me what you picked out!
[Framme]
Brace yourself. I selected, just for you...
this cute frilly dress!
[Timerra]
Aaah! I love it!
[Framme]
I knew you would. Come on and feel this fabric.
It's nice and thick.
[Timerra]
Oh, uh. It is?
[Framme]
Yup. All your clothes are so light, I figured you
might like something a little warmer.
[Timerra]
How, uh...thoughtful of you...
[Framme]
What is it?
[Timerra]
Huh? Oh, sorry. I love it, Framme.
[Timerra]
Now, ready to see what I chose for you?
Ta-da! It's a scarlet robe!
[Framme]
It's so cute!
[Timerra]
Yeah? I added some flashy accessories to make
that distinctive dye in the robe really pop.
[Framme]
I love it. This is exactly my color. It looks nice
and breathable too.
[Timerra]
Hehe, right? I thought something nice and
lightweight would suit you.
[Timerra]
Wait. Oh, shoot!
[Framme]
What's wrong?
[Timerra]
I just remembered a thing I gotta get to.
Princess business. You know how it is.
[Timerra]
Sorry, Framme. I'll make it up to you─I promise!
[Timerra]
[Framme]
Huh... That was sudden.
[Framme]
Something seemed kinda off, there.
[Framme]
Maybe she didn't like the dress I picked out...
--- A ---

[Framme]
I just don't get it.
[Framme]
Why did she leave all of a sudden?


[Timerra]
Hup! Ahh...
Hup! Ahh...
[Framme]
Princess Timerra?
[Timerra]
Huff... Huff... I need to get stronger.
[Framme]
Looks like you're training.
[Timerra]
Yep! Gotta be strong to protect my country!
[Timerra]
Oh. Uh...
[Timerra]
I'm really sorry I split the other day.
[Framme]
No, no, it's fine! I know you must be pretty busy
with all your important princess duties.
[Timerra]
I got so wrapped up picking clothes for you
I completely forgot it was time to train.
[Framme]
Was that all?
[Framme]
I thought, maybe... I dunno. That you didn't like
the outfit I gave you.
[Timerra]
No, no! It was stylish as all get-out!
[Framme]
But then...why'd you act like there was
something wrong with it?
[Timerra]
Uh, OK. Don't take this the wrong way...
[Timerra]
The Queendom of Solm? It's a hot place.
I wouldn't last 15 minutes in that heavy fabric.
[Timerra]
Plus, I need nice, movable clothes so I can be
ready to fight at a moment's notice.
[Framme]
Ooh! So that's what it was about.
[Timerra]
That dress was really cute though─honest!
I'm sorry for being so, you know, wishy-washy.
[Framme]
No, it's OK! I just feel silly for not thinking of
that on my own.
[Framme]
Can I maybe...pick another outfit for you?
[Framme]
Except this time, something better suited for
that toasty Solm weather.
[Timerra]
Aw, what a great idea! Of course!
[Timerra]
Another shopping trip with my friend Framme─
I can't wait!
[Timerra]
First I gotta prepare for this next battle though.
Can't try on clothes if I'm dead.
[Framme]
Of course. I'll leave you to it.
[Timerra]
Actually, I was gonna ask if you wanted to join.
What do you say?
[Framme]
Training my heart out with Princess Timerra?
I'd love nothing more!
