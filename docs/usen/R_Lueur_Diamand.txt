=== Alear & Diamant ===

[Alear]
Ah! One of the Corrupted!
[Diamant]
The Corrupted? Where?
[Alear]
Diamant! Help!
[Diamant]
Hyah!
[Alear]
Thanks for the save, Diamant. Sorry to trouble
you like that.
[Diamant]
No trouble at all. However, I must ask...
[Diamant]
How did that creature manage to overpower
and frighten the Divine One?
[Alear]
It came out of nowhere! I just started running.
I'm...not really good with the Corrupted.
[Diamant]
Not good with them? You handle them in battle
just fine.
[Alear]
It's different on the battlefield. I can spot them
first, then steel myself before engaging.
[Alear]
That last Corrupted soldier got the drop on me.
My guard was down.
[Alear]
I'm an easy target for them outside of battle.
[Diamant]
Hm, I don't follow.
[Alear]
Isn't there something that makes your skin
crawl, Diamant?
[Diamant]
I suppose...hairy caterpillars can have that sort
of effect on me.
[Alear]
OK, let's say you knew you were about to see a
big caterpillar. You'd have a chance to prepare.
[Alear]
Now imagine you're eating dinner at home, and
a caterpillar suddenly drops onto your plate.
[Diamant]
Hmm...
[Alear]
Wouldn't that startle you? Wouldn't you cry out
in surprise?
[Diamant]
I probably would.
[Alear]
That's what sneak attacks from the Corrupted
feel like─caterpillars dropping on my plate.
[Diamant]
I understand. Very clear explanation,
Divine One.
[Alear]
That was a strange example, but I'm glad you
followed it.
[Alear]
Sorry you had to watch me struggle like that.
How unflattering...
[Alear]
I wish I was flawless like you, Diamant.
[Diamant]
Flawless? Hm.

[Diamant]
...
[Alear]
That's the most concerned I've ever seen you
look, Diamant.
[Diamant]
Oh, Divine One. I apologize. Didn't think anyone
else was here.
[Alear]
What's that you're holding?
[Diamant]
This is a medal my father gave to me a while
back. A commendation from the king.
[Alear]
From King Morion...
[Diamant]
I was with our troops during an intense battle
against Elusia. We found ourselves surrounded.
[Diamant]
We needed to make a quick retreat, so I took
command out of sheer desperation.
[Diamant]
When we returned, Father gave me this medal.
It felt like the first time he saw me as a leader.
[Diamant]
But occasionally...I wonder...
[Diamant]
Was it my leadership that got us home, or was
it pure luck? Perhaps I didn't earn this.
[Alear]
So, even the crown prince of Brodia suffers
through moments of self-doubt.
[Diamant]
Sorry to shatter the illusion.
[Diamant]
To protect my country's reputation, I must
insist you keep this conversation private.
[Alear]
Of course. You saw me in a vulnerable moment
with that Corrupted soldier, so let's call it even.
[Alear]
But I will say one thing...
[Diamant]
Mm?
[Alear]
Knowing that you do have a vulnerable side
makes me feel a bit closer to you.
[Alear]
Vulnerability isn't always a bad thing.
[Diamant]
Hm. You're a peculiar leader, Divine One.

[Alear]
...
[Diamant]
Divine One? Are you training?
[Alear]
Yes. I can't shake this feeling that I'm not
strong enough.
[Alear]
The truth is...I'm worried. And I feel weak. How
can I restore peace to the world in this state?
[Diamant]
Huh.
[Alear]
What is it, Diamant?
[Diamant]
It's just...surprising. I never would have guessed
that the Divine One had doubts like this.
[Alear]
Of course I do. I worry a lot. My plate is full,
and caterpillars keep dropping on it!
[Diamant]
Hahaha!
[Alear]
You know what I mean, right?
[Diamant]
Yes. And I see what you meant earlier about
vulnerability. I feel closer to you too.
[Alear]
Really? All of a sudden? But you've seen this
side of me before.
[Alear]
I fled from that Corrupted soldier in such
a panic.
[Diamant]
Haha, I remember.
[Diamant]
What I mean is, you make me feel safe enough
to discuss my deepest concerns.
[Diamant]
If it weren't for you, I might still be clutching
that medal and thinking about my father.
[Diamant]
I'm grateful for that. Thank you, Divine One.
[Alear]
I feel the same way. I appreciate having an ally
to confide in too.
[Alear]
I suspect we have a lot in common.
[Diamant]
You might be right.
[Alear]
Let's keep this up. We may seem guarded to the
others, but I'll always be open to chat with you.
--- S ---


[Diamant]
Divine One? Is this a good time to talk?
[Alear]
Sure. What is it, Diamant?
[Diamant]
I'd like for you to have this.
[Alear]
You're giving me a ring?
[Diamant]
I am. It's made from the medal my father gave
to me. I had it melted down and recast.
[Alear]
The medal from your father?! Why would you
do that? It was so important to you!
[Diamant]
In Brodia, medals and tokens change form
whenever they change hands. It's tradition.
[Alear]
I don't know about this. I couldn't possibly take
something so precious from you.
[Diamant]
You wanted us to keep relying on each other,
right? And offer mutual support?
[Diamant]
Think of this as a reminder. I'll always be
around when you need me.
[Alear]
I see...
[Diamant]
So? Will you accept the ring, Divine One?
[Alear]
Well, Diamant...
[Alear]
I'm not sure I'm worthy of such a personal gift.
[Alear]
I guess I'll just have to do everything I can to
live up to this.
[Diamant]
So you will accept it?
[Alear]
I will.
[Diamant]
I'm glad to hear it, Divine One.
[Alear]
This is actually pretty funny... I have something
I'd like to give you as well.
[Diamant]
The Pact Ring?
[Alear]
I was planning on giving this to you soon, but
you beat me to the punch.
[Diamant]
But this ring is so important...
[Alear]
So is the ring you just gave me!
[Alear]
There's no one I'd rather have by my side,
Diamant. I won't take no for an answer.
[Diamant]
Don't worry. I enjoy fighting beside you too
much to turn this down. I accept your gift.
[Diamant]
Amazing. It's like I can feel the history of the
Divine Dragons─the history of Lythos itself.
[Alear]
I feel the history of Brodia within your ring
as well, Diamant.
[Diamant]
It's changed in form between fathers and sons,
but that item tells the story of my kingdom.
[Alear]
If we hope to add worthwhile stories of our
own, we'd better help each other out.
[Diamant]
I'm not worried. When we work together,
there's nothing we can't do.
[Diamant]
I vow to protect you, Divine One. From this
point on, I will always fight by your side.
