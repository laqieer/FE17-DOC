=== Boucheron & Zelkov ===
--- C ---



[Boucheron]
Is this a good idea?
[Zelkov]
Is something the *matter*?
[Boucheron]
Look at this. It's an invitation from someone
called the "Forest Sage."
[Zelkov]
I am *unfamiliar* with the moniker.
[Boucheron]
Me too. But they want me to go to their cabin.
[Zelkov]
Oh?
[Boucheron]
See this map of the mountain they drew?
[Boucheron]
It says if I can get to the cabin, they'll give me
special medicine to fix my sense of direction.
[Boucheron]
I didn't know such a thing existed, but
according to this, it does.
[Zelkov]
A cure for poor direction sense? Does the world
truly hold such *wonders*?
[Boucheron]
I hope so. The thing is, my sense of direction,
honestly, is pretty bad.
[Boucheron]
The other day, I went out for a walk holding
a compass, and I STILL got lost.
[Zelkov]
Most *concerning.* So, what will you do?
[Boucheron]
What else can I do but go?
[Boucheron]
This has been a problem, and not just for me.
If a potion really can fix it, I have to try.
[Zelkov]
Then allow me to wish you good *fortune.*
[Boucheron]
Thanks. Here's hoping it helps!

[Zelkov]
Ah, Boucheron. What became of the Forest
Sage *situation*?
[Boucheron]
Well... I tried to meet them, but...I got lost on
the way.
[Zelkov]
An *unforeseen* turn of events, to be sure.
[Boucheron]
It was strange, though.
[Boucheron]
I took a nap in an empty cave, and when I woke
up, there was a letter from the Forest Sage.
[Zelkov]
Go on.
[Boucheron]
It was full of encouragement, like "You're close,"
"You got this," and "Don't give up."
[Zelkov]
*Extraordinary.*
[Boucheron]
That's not all. It explained which wrong turns
I'd made to get so lost.
[Boucheron]
And it offered advice on what I could do to get
better at finding my way.
[Zelkov]
I wonder about the *motivations* of this
so-called Forest Sage.
[Zelkov]
They could have simply left the *medicine* with
this note, but chose not to do so. Why?
[Boucheron]
It must be really important, for some reason,
that I make it to that cabin.
[Zelkov]
A *mysterious* sage, to say the least.
[Boucheron]
Yeah. I've made up my mind, though. I'm going
to reach that cabin, no matter what.
[Zelkov]
I admire your *determination.* Allow me once
more to wish you luck.
[Boucheron]
Thanks. Fingers crossed that next time, I'll have
good news for you.

[Boucheron]
I've done it! I've finally reached the cabin!
Forest Sage, here I come!


[Zelkov]
Excellent, you have *arrived.* Welcome. I am the
Forest Sage.
[Boucheron]
Huh? Is that...Zelkov?!
[Boucheron]
I... I don't understand. What's going on?
[Zelkov]
As promised, here is your *medicine.* Go on,
try it.
[Boucheron]
Uh...OK.
[Boucheron]
...
[Boucheron]
It's sweet. It tastes like, uh...candy.
[Zelkov]
Correct. It is nothing more than a *confection.*
Perhaps it will put a slight spring in your step.
[Zelkov]
As for your *sense* of direction...you did reach
this remote cabin with very little help.
[Zelkov]
Perhaps that *suggests* something about the
state of your abilities.
[Boucheron]
Oooh! I got better without even realizing it!
[Zelkov]
*Precisely.*
[Zelkov]
I had heard rumors of this weakness of yours.
*Correcting* it seemed like a worthy project.
[Zelkov]
That is how the *Forest Sage* came to be.
I devised this stratagem to lead you here.
[Boucheron]
You went to a lot of trouble.
[Zelkov]
Elaborate *pursuits* are a passion of mine.
[Zelkov]
At first, I thought I would simply *train* you in
navigation. But that was much too simple.
[Zelkov]
I required a more intricate plan, and so I devised
*this.* I hope you enjoyed the experience.
[Boucheron]
You know what? I did. Thanks for putting all
this together for me.
[Zelkov]
You are every bit the *gentleman* I had heard.
Some would be angry about the deception.
[Boucheron]
Angry? Don't be silly.
[Boucheron]
I really appreciated the "Forest Sage." I even
hoped we might be friends.
[Zelkov]
Why is *that*?
[Boucheron]
Well, I remembered that nice letter they left for
me and the blanket they covered me with.
[Boucheron]
It was obvious how much they cared. In my
mind, they seemed pretty swell.
[Zelkov]
I see.
[Boucheron]
There's just one problem... I doubt this has
done anything for my sense of direction.
[Zelkov]
What? Why?
[Boucheron]
You're not the first person to coach me on how
to correct my mistakes there.
[Boucheron]
None of it's worked. That's why I really had my
heart set on that medicine.
[Boucheron]
But in the end, it was only sugar.
[Zelkov]
...
[Boucheron]
Are you OK, Zelkov? Sorry about this. I know
it must be disappointing.
[Zelkov]
Oh, no, my friend. *Quite* the opposite.
[Zelkov]
This proves to be a grander *game* than I had
anticipated. I am excited to plot my next move.
[Boucheron]
Your next move? You mean to do it again?
[Zelkov]
Soon, you will receive a missive from the Ocean
Sage. I hope you will *attend* to their words.
[Boucheron]
Hahaha, all right. As you wish, O great
sage Zelkov.
