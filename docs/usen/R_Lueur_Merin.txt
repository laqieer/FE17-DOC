[Merrin] 
Divine One, I have something to discuss with 
you, if it's not too much trouble.
[Alear] 
Oh? No, it's no trouble at all.
[Alear] 
But first, you can loosen up a little. I don't bite, 
I promise.
[Merrin] 
Aha, of course! Forgive me.
[Merrin] 
I've been working up the courage to ask you 
about this.
[Merrin] 
See, I love rare critters, and I especially 
love dragons.
[Alear] 
So, you think of me as a...rare critter?
[Merrin] 
Well, you're rare at least. You're the world's 
only Divine Dragon.
[Merrin] 
So I was hoping you'd help me understand your 
species a little better.
[Alear] 
Um... Wow.
[Merrin] 
What's wrong?
[Alear] 
Nothing, nothing. Please, go ahead.
[Merrin] 
All right, I'll cut to the chase, then. Tell me, 
what is a typical day like for you?
[Alear] 
Let's see... Someone wakes me up in the 
morning. I eat breakfast. I train until noon.
[Alear] 
I live like a normal person, to be honest. 
Is that helpful?
[Merrin] 
Very! Basic activity is much like that of an 
average human...
[Alear] 
Wait... Are you writing all this down?
[Merrin] 
Of course. This is excellent material for the 
book I'm working on about you.
[Alear] 
Book?! You don't think that's a little much?
[Merrin] 
What do you mean? Future generations deserve 
to know all about the Divine Dragon.
[Alear] 
I, uh... I guess so.

[Merrin] 
Hmm...
[Alear] 
...
[Alear] 
Merrin... It's difficult to train with you staring at 
me like that.
[Merrin] 
Don't mind me. I'm not even here.
[Merrin] 
I'm simply observing your behaviors to gather 
material for my book.
[Alear] 
And how long do you plan to do that, exactly?
[Merrin] 
As long as it takes.
[Merrin] 
Don't you worry. I'm not going to stop until I've 
captured every last detail!
[Alear] 
Oh, please, cut it out!
[Merrin] 
What? I was just...
[Alear] 
You were just nothing! I'm not one of your 
critters, OK?
[Alear] 
Yes, I am a dragon. I live longer than humans 
and have certain unique abilities.
[Alear] 
But I also have feelings. I don't appreciate being 
gawked at like an animal.
[Merrin] 
Divine One, I'm so sorry!
[Merrin] 
It's just that...to me, you are more than human.
[Merrin] 
You're a truly divine being. I wanted to make 
sure future generations understood that.
[Merrin] 
In hopes that they would protect you, the one 
and only Divine Dragon.
[Merrin] 
But I never meant for you to feel like some kind 
of research specimen.
[Alear] 
I know you didn't. It's all right.
[Merrin] 
No, it's not! Because that's exactly how I made 
you feel, isn't it?
[Merrin] 
Forget about the book. I'll stop writing it. 
I'm sorry, Divine One.
[Alear] 
Merrin, please! It's really OK!

[Alear] 
Merrin, listen. I'm sorry for blowing up at you 
the other day.
[Merrin] 
"Blowing up" is a bit strong...
[Alear] 
I didn't understand that you were observing me 
so closely because you genuinely care.
[Merrin] 
No... I was in the wrong, not you.
[Merrin] 
I was completely oblivious to how my actions 
made you feel.
[Alear] 
You know...now that we understand each other 
better, I'd be happy to help you.
[Alear] 
There aren't many books about Divine Dragons, 
and nobody's asked me about my life before.
[Alear] 
You want to fill that gap─help people learn 
about me. I can see the value in that.
[Alear] 
What I'm trying to say is...please, observe to 
your heart's content.
[Merrin] 
Really?! You mean it?!
[Alear] 
I mean it.
[Merrin] 
Thank you, Divine One! I really appreciate that.
[Merrin] 
When I'm observing you, I forget about all the 
stress and worry. Everything bad slips away.
[Merrin] 
I just feel...joyful! And I want to share that joy 
with others, you know?
[Alear] 
Haha! You're truly one of a kind, Merrin. Maybe 
I should write a book about you.
[Merrin] 
You flatter me, Divine One.
[Alear] 
I do have a request. Stop thinking of me as 
"more than human," all right?
[Alear] 
I may be the only Divine Dragon, but hey. 
You're one of a kind too.
[Merrin] 
Hehe, you make a good point! I guess we're 
both rare critters, aren't we?
[Alear] 
Exactly.
[Alear] 
Oh, and also? I want to be the first to read this 
book of yours.
[Merrin] 
Of course! I can't think of anyone better to 
fact-check it.

[Merrin] 
Divine One! I've finished a draft of my book! 
Would you mind giving it a read?
[Alear] 
I'd be happy to. Let me take a look...
[Alear] 
"The Divine Dragon awoke in a 
floating castle after 1,000 years of slumber...
[Alear] 
"Humble and kind, the Divine Dragon fought 
with a courageous heart to protect the people."
[Alear] 
I think I'm starting to blush...
[Merrin] 
It is the truth.
[Alear] 
"The Divine Dragon can live thousands of years 
and possesses powers that humans do not.
[Alear] 
"However, this dragon's habitat and behaviors 
are no different than those of a typical human.
[Alear] 
"And let it be noted, the Divine Dragon is the 
most precious being in the world to the author."
[Alear] 
Merrin, this is...
[Merrin] 
I'm sorry. I had to write it. Don't worry, I'll cut it 
from the final copy. It's just...
[Merrin] 
Divine One, I need you to know how important 
you are to me.
[Merrin] 
And I want people to always remember there 
was a human who cared very deeply for you.
[Alear] 
...
[Alear] 
I want you to leave it in.
[Merrin] 
I don't...
[Alear] 
And please add this: "The author of the book 
was equally as precious to the Divine Dragon.
[Alear] 
"So much so, the Divine Dragon gave Merrin the 
Pact Ring and vowed to be with her always."
[Merrin] 
D-Divine One! You cannot give me something 
so precious!
[Alear] 
If you care so very deeply for me, you have 
to accept it.
[Alear] 
Your book must tell the truth─that the Divine 
Dragon adored a human named Merrin.
[Merrin] 
If that's how you feel. Thank you, Divine One.
[Alear] 
When this incredible book is done, I hope people 
will see that I'm not so different from them.
[Merrin] 
Yes, there's just one problem. I can't finish 
it yet.
[Alear] 
Why not?
[Merrin] 
I have to write about our life together─about 
how a human and dragon cared for one another.
[Alear] 
You make a good point, Merrin. And I can't wait 
to write that part of the story with you.
[Merrin] 
Yes!
[Merrin] 
I adore you, Divine One. The stories we write 
together will be told for thousands of years.
