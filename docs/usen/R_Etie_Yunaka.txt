[Etie] 
Hey, Yunaka. Mind doing me a favor?
[Yunaka] 
Whatcha need, pumpkin-seed?
[Etie] 
Stay real still. I need to give you a once-over.
[Yunaka] 
Wait, uh, what? Why? What are you looking for? 
And what are you gonna do if you find it?
[Etie] 
So many questions. Here, this'll only take 
a second.
[Yunaka] 
Ugh...
[Yunaka] 
Hey, I didn't consent to a shakedown. You're 
searching me like you think I stole something.
[Etie] 
Good guess. How did you figure it out?
[Yunaka] 
Seriously?! That was a joke! I haven't stolen 
anything! Not even one thing!
[Etie] 
I happen to know that you did.
[Yunaka] 
Yeah?! You think your touchy-feely hands are 
any kind of evidence?! Get outta here!
[Etie] 
Calm down. Nobody's in trouble.
[Yunaka] 
Oh, nobody's in trouble?! Does that mean I'm 
free to go?!
[Yunaka] 
Great! Then I'm out!
[Yunaka] 

[Etie] 
Hey, wait! Yunaka!

[Etie] 
Sorry about before, Yunaka. I think maybe you 
misunderstood me.
[Yunaka] 
I misunderstood you, did I?
[Etie] 
I mean, you did steal something. That part 
is true.
[Etie] 
But what you stole, well...
[Yunaka] 
What did I steal?
[Etie] 
You captured my interest.
[Yunaka] 
Huh?
[Etie] 
You have my ideal physique. I couldn't look 
away from how perfect you are.
[Etie] 
That's why I wanted to do a close inspection.
[Yunaka] 
Aw, what a preventable misunderstanding...
[Etie] 
You're right. I was rude. I'm really sorry.
[Yunaka] 
Setting aside how bonkers this is for a second, 
what makes you think I'm any kind of ideal?
[Yunaka] 
Your physique is way more impressive 
than mine.
[Etie] 
That's nice of you to say, but between the two 
of us, you might actually be stronger.
[Etie] 
Sure, I'm ripped, but that's just because I never 
stop working out.
[Etie] 
You, on the other hand, have the kind of muscle 
that can only come...naturally.
[Etie] 
Your metabolism must have been set like that 
early. Probably when you were little.
[Etie] 
You only get that kind of muscle by constantly 
being exposed to extreme circumstances.
[Etie] 
I can't prove any of that, of course, but my gut 
says I'm on the right track.
[Yunaka] 
Um...
[Etie] 
What exactly have you lived through?
[Yunaka] 
Geez...
[Etie] 
Yeah, that's the kind of rude thing I'm going to 
try not to pull anymore.
[Yunaka] 
Oh! Are you...sure?
[Etie] 
Of course. Don't worry about it.
[Etie] 
I admire you, that's all. I wanted you to know it.
[Etie] 
And if it's OK with you, I'd like to be friends.
[Yunaka] 
Y'know, that's actually super sweet. Yeah, why 
not? Let's be chums, chum!

[Yunaka] 
Oooh, what a peaceful field! I feel like I could 
flop over and nap for a thousand years.
[Etie] 
This is my secret spot. I come here alone 
sometimes to goof off.
[Yunaka] 
Not sure I'd take you for the flower-loving type.
[Etie] 
I grew up in a pretty flower-heavy town, so it 
cheers me up being surrounded by them.
[Yunaka] 
...
[Yunaka] 
That's really beautiful.
[Etie] 
What is?
[Yunaka] 
Growing up surrounded by flowers. Memories 
to cheer you up. I'm a little jealous, honestly.
[Yunaka] 
My life as a kid wasn't anything like that.
[Etie] 
No?
[Yunaka] 
No, but I wish it had been. A life like yours... 
It would've been a dream.
[Etie] 
Poor Yunaka...
[Yunaka] 
Kidding! You should've seen your face.
[Etie] 
I can't even begin to imagine the kind of life 
you must have lived.
[Etie] 
Your muscles tell a pretty harrowing story.
[Etie] 
So I've got a lot of respect for the way you 
came out the other side.
[Yunaka] 
Ah, gee whiz...
[Etie] 
See these flowers? They're from my hometown.
[Yunaka] 
They're gorgeous.
[Etie] 
This one is associated with admiration. 
Sounds perfect for us, huh?
[Yunaka] 
Hehe, it does. Yeah!
[Etie] 
Why don't we make flower crowns with them 
as a gift for each other?
[Etie] 
That's what true friends do where I'm from.
[Etie] 
They make flower crowns and pray for long, 
happy lives together.
[Yunaka] 
Love it! Let's make such big crowns, we get 
mistaken for queens of the world!
