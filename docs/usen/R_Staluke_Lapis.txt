[Alcryst] 
I vow to protect you, Lapis.
[Lapis] 
Prince Alcryst? What are you talking about?
[Alcryst] 
You kept me safe during battle the other day.
[Lapis] 
Of course I did. I'm your retainer. It's my duty 
to keep you safe.
[Alcryst] 
Yes, but I don't deserve it. I'm useless, but your 
character and skills have real value.
[Alcryst] 
That's why, from now on, I vow to protect 
you in battle, Lapis!
[Lapis] 
Wh─
[Alcryst] 
But then, I suppose those words are hollow 
coming from someone as unreliable as me.
[Lapis] 
That makes three.
[Alcryst] 
What?
[Lapis] 
This is the third time you've vowed to protect 
me like this, Prince Alcryst.
[Alcryst] 
Oh. Yes. Now that you mention it, I do recall 
saying it...just after we met.
[Alcryst] 
And then again at the Grand Crossing, if I'm 
recalling correctly.
[Lapis] 
That's right. Hearing you say those words, 
it made me...
[Lapis] 
...
[Lapis] 
Please stop trying to switch our duties like this. 
I'm just a retainer. You're a prince.
[Alcryst] 
I─ I'm sorry. I'm just being honest about how 
I see things.
[Lapis] 
No, I know that.
[Lapis] 
But I don't think many retainers would be OK 
with their master taking a hit for them.
[Alcryst] 
I...apologize.
[Lapis] 
Oh, please don't take it hard. I know how you 
meant it. I appreciate the thought...OK?
[Alcryst] 
Yes...of course.

[Alcryst] 
Lapis? I want to apologize for making that vow 
the other day.
[Lapis] 
Oh, but, Prince Alcryst. Please don't worry 
about it.
[Lapis] 
I should apologize for trying to tell you what 
you're allowed to say.
[Alcryst] 
You did nothing wrong.
[Alcryst] 
It was my mistake. I didn't consider how my 
words would make you feel.
[Alcryst] 
However...there is one thing I'll stand by.
[Alcryst] 
I really do think that you're an amazing 
person, Lapis.
[Lapis] 
That's not... I'm really not that amazing.
[Alcryst] 
You are. I know that you are.
[Alcryst] 
I know that you always send part of your pay 
back home to support your family.
[Alcryst] 
I also know you spend your free time subduing 
dangerous beasts that enter the area.
[Lapis] 
How did you...find out about...
[Alcryst] 
You're so much more valuable to this world 
than I am, Lapis.
[Alcryst] 
That's why I─
[Lapis] 
That's why you keep saying that you should be 
protecting me.
[Lapis] 
Oh...
[Lapis] 
Prince Alcryst... You have no idea...
[Lapis] 
It breaks my heart to hear you talk like this.
[Lapis] 
I'm sorry... I have to go.
[Lapis] 

[Alcryst] 
Wow... I really am useless.
[Alcryst] 
I can't even let a close retainer know how much 
I appreciate her without upsetting her...
[Alcryst] 
I'm unfit to be anyone's master.
[Alcryst]

[Lapis] 
I vow to protect you, Prince Alcryst!
[Alcryst] 
Lapis?
[Lapis] 
Like I keep saying, I'm your retainer. Protecting 
you is my job.
[Lapis] 
But I'm not doing this because I have to.
[Lapis] 
I want to protect you.
[Alcryst] 
Why in the world would you want to protect 
me? I'm not worth it.
[Lapis] 
That! That right there. That's what I'm talking 
about when I say that you have no idea.
[Alcryst] 
You said that last time─that I had no idea how 
you felt.
[Lapis] 
It's not about my feelings, Prince Alcryst. 
You have no idea how great you really are.
[Alcryst] 
How...great I am?
[Lapis] 
You're so, so perceptive. You always know so 
much about other people.
[Lapis] 
Yet you choose to focus on each person's best 
qualities. You find skills no one else notices.
[Lapis] 
I can't even count all the times you've lifted me 
up by reminding me what I'm good at.
[Alcryst] 
It's easy to notice those things when everyone 
else is more skilled than I am. Drastically so.
[Lapis] 
No, that's not true. It's because you're a kind 
person, Prince Alcryst.
[Lapis] 
You're skilled and kind and so charming...
[Lapis] 
Yet you'd throw your life away to keep others 
safe─even the retainers who protect you.
[Lapis] 
Do you really think that's supposed to make 
me happy?
[Alcryst] 
Oh...
[Alcryst] 
In that case...what if we form an alliance 
of protection?
[Lapis] 
What does that mean?
[Alcryst] 
It means I will vow to protect you...and accept 
your protection of me. And you'll do the same.
[Alcryst] 
That way, we both protect someone we care for 
and accept that we are cared for in return.
[Lapis] 
Heh, much better. You finally sound like the 
kind prince that you are. Count me in.
[Alcryst] 
I'm glad to hear it. Let's try this again, but 
together this time.
[Alcryst] 
I vow to protect you, Lapis.
[Lapis] 
And I vow to protect you, Prince Alcryst.
[Alcryst] 
Thank you...and I accept.
