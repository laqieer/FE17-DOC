[Lyn]
Ah, the breeze...the smell... So much like home.
[Alear]
Home? Do you mean the world you're from?
[Lyn]
Yes. This place is just like the Sacae Plains.
That's where I was born.
[Lyn]
Ahh, I remember their beauty well. When I was
young, those plains seemed to stretch forever.
[Alear]
It truly is wonderful scenery, and the wind is
so pleasant.
[Lyn]
It makes me happy to hear you say that, even if
this is not my true homeland.
[Lyn]
We woke at dawn and tended to our cattle,
caught game, and slept when the sun set.
[Lyn]
That was every day of my life, growing up on
the plains. But it didn't last forever.
[Alear]
Can you tell me what happened?
[Lyn]
The Lorca tribe, my people, were attacked by
vicious bandits... They killed so many of us.
[Lyn]
The bandits were cowardly. They poisoned our
drinking water, then attacked in the chaos.
[Alear]
That's terrible...
[Lyn]
Yes, but the Sacae Plains are our motherland,
and have always blessed us with their bounty.
[Lyn]
It is a place I love deeply, though it holds many
painful memories.
[Lyn]
Enough mourning! The sense of this place is
exciting me!
[Lyn]
Ready your sword! I'll show you the true skill
of a Lorca tribe warrior!
[Alear]
I can't wait. You won't beat me easily, though.
[Alear]
I've overcome so many hardships in my life.
And more will come, I'm sure.
[Lyn]
But our bond will grow stronger with this fight,
as will my power.
[Lyn]
So whatever you do, don't hold back!

[Lyn]
Wow. You beat me soundly. You're very strong.
[Alear]
And you were as skilled as I expected! Very
powerful too...
[Alear]
I wonder if I could be like you? If I grew up on
the plains, I mean.
[Lyn]
Haha, perhaps. I learned to fight out here, but
I learned more when I met Eliwood and Hector.
[Lyn]
We traveled long and far together. Sometimes,
we'd compete with one another, just like this.
[Lyn]
They helped me to learn of justice and courage.
And they gave me the strength to trust others.
[Lyn]
And that strength has made me who I am today.
[Alear]
When I woke, I had no memories and no one
I felt I could rely on.
[Alear]
But now I have so many friends around me to
teach me about the world...and about myself.
[Alear]
I hope that, at the end of my journey, I'll be as
strong as them. And you.
[Lyn]
You'll definitely become much stronger!
I'm sure of it!
[Lyn]
Of course, I'll help too!
[Alear]
Thank you, Lyn.

[Lyn]
Relax
[Lyn]
Are you ready? Then come at me! Attack with
everything you've got!


[Alear]
I can hear the voices of enemy forces in those
tents. We should attack them, quickly.

[Lyn]
Relax
[Lyn]
I'm not going to just stand around! I'll have at
them too!

[Lyn]
These plains, the green land, the wind...they
raised me to be strong. And you?
[Lyn]
Relax

[Alear]
I'm still improving, but I have gained strength
during our journey.
[Lyn]
I'm glad to hear you're feeling stronger, but I
won't be holding back!


[Ivy]
It feels a little strange to fight you. I'm reminded
of my father and all that happened.
[Lyn]
Relax
[Lyn]
Oh? I'm rather happy about this fight myself.
Facing someone as skilled as you is a pleasure.

[Ivy]
If only he had been so encouraging. Very well,
let's begin.

[Hortensia]
Seeing you makes me feel like I might see my
father again. Too bad that's not how it works.
[Lyn]
Unfortunately, I'm neither a substitute for your
father nor his memory.
[Lyn]
Still, I can see you've become quite talented.
So show me just how much you've grown!
[Hortensia]
I am refined in strength and charm! If my father
were here, he'd be in awe of what I've become!
