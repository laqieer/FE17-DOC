=== Etie & Céline ===
--- C ---



[Etie]
It's been a while since we had time for a cup
of tea together, Princess Céline.
[Céline]
There's no need to stand on ceremony, Etie.
We've been friends too long for that.
[Etie]
As you wish, Céline. How's your tea?
[Céline]
Most delicious, thank you. This is a lovely pot
you've brewed for us.
[Céline]
The pungent aroma and flavor tell me it's a
single-origin tea from the northern fields, yes?
[Etie]
You can tell where it's from with one sip?
You really know your leaves.
[Céline]
Go on, Etie, try some. The aroma is really quite
unlike anything else.
[Etie]
Thank you. Don't mind if I do.
[Etie]
Hmm...
[Céline]
Well?
[Etie]
Well...it tastes like tea to me. You could tell me
it's from any region and I'd believe you.
[Céline]
Hm-hm, I thought as much. You always were
a bit blind to the subtleties of tea.
[Etie]
It's not that I can't taste it. It's that no one's
on your level when it comes to this stuff.
[Céline]
Hm?
[Céline]
Is something wrong, Etie?
[Etie]
What do you mean?
[Céline]
I noticed your hand trembling. There it is again.
[Etie]
Oh, uh... I don't think so. You must have
imagined it.
[Céline]
Really? Well, if you're sure...

[Céline]
The tea is perfect today too. Every moment of
rest we get is a blessing.
[Etie]
Yeah. There's so much to deal with that I need
little moments like this to keep me sane.
[Céline]
Too true.
[Etie]
Do you remember our first teatimes together?
[Céline]
Not especially well. We've been having them
for so long, after all.
[Céline]
At the time, my brother's health was still very
tenuous. Every day was nerve-wracking.
[Etie]
But all that stress toughened you up.
[Céline]
I knew I had to be able to support my brother...
in case of the worst.
[Céline]
But just as I was getting stronger, my brother's
health vastly improved, thanks to his training.
[Etie]
Heh, I remember how good it felt to see two
strong siblings, side by side.
[Etie]
After I became retainer to Prince Alfred, he
urged me to train as well. And look at me now!
[Céline]
Uh...Etie?
[Etie]
Is something wrong?
[Céline]
I definitely saw your hand trembling.
[Etie]
Oh...
[Céline]
Are you not feeling well? Have you fallen ill?
[Etie]
No, it's nothing like that. It's just that my teacup
is pretty heavy.
[Céline]
That much I knew already.
[Céline]
You've used a weighted teacup to build muscle
ever since you became Alfred's retainer.
[Céline]
But it never used to trouble you, and now you
barely seem able to lift it!
[Etie]
All right. Here's the thing, Céline...
[Etie]
I got a new teacup.
[Céline]
Pardon?
[Etie]
Here, try holding it.
[Céline]
Ah! Wh-what in the world?! I've handled
cannonballs lighter than this!
[Etie]
I had it specially made. The old one wasn't
enough of a workout anymore.
[Céline]
Huh, no wonder your hand shakes, if you've
been using this for a teacup.
[Etie]
Now you know.
[Céline]
Thank goodness. If something were to happen
to you, Etie, I don't think I'd ever recover.
[Etie]
Aw, Céline. I'm sorry I worried you.
[Céline]
I'm fine, now that I know it's nothing serious.
Teatime again soon, hmm?

[Céline]
Behold, Etie!
[Céline]
I tried adding honey to the single-origin tea, and
I think I might have created something new.
[Etie]
Really? I'd like to try it.
[Etie]
...
[Etie]
Céline, this is incredible. I've never had anything
like it.
[Céline]
Heh heh, very impressive, Etie.
[Etie]
Impressive? What did I do?
[Céline]
Your hand no longer shakes. You've mastered
your new teacup, haven't you?
[Etie]
Not exactly. I just switched to a regular
porcelain one.
[Céline]
Whatever for? Don't tell me you intend to
abandon your training.
[Etie]
Oh, I'm still going to train. Just not during
our teatimes.
[Céline]
Forgive me, Etie. This is because I couldn't stop
prying, isn't it?
[Etie]
No, that's not why.
[Etie]
Training is important to me, but the time I get
to spend with you is even more important.
[Etie]
It's OK to take a break during our teatime.
I don't need to try to do both at once.
[Céline]
Oh! I see.
[Etie]
Every day, the war grinds us down.
[Etie]
I don't know how much longer I'll be able to
simply relax with you.
[Etie]
So, I think it's best I not spend our precious
moments together training too.
[Céline]
...
[Etie]
You OK there?
[Céline]
I'm touched, Etie, that you'd go so far out of
your way for me.
[Etie]
Of course. Come on, Céline. Don't you know
you're one of my best friends in the world?
[Céline]
I could say the same of you, Etie.
[Etie]
Thank you. That's a real honor.
[Céline]
Oh! You're shaking again.
[Etie]
That's not from training. I'm just feeling a bit
emotional is all.
[Céline]
Oh, Etie. Come here. You can lean on me
whenever you need.
[Etie]
Céline...
[Céline]
Hahaha... Not so tight, Etie.
[Céline]
Uh...urgh...
[Céline]
Etie... You train too much. You're...crushing me.
