=== Alfred & Boucheron ===
--- C ---



[Alfred]
Hmm... Nice.
[Boucheron]
Ugh... Ugh...
[Alfred]
I've said it before, but I really admire those
muscles, Boucheron.
[Boucheron]
Ugh... Oh. I appreciate the compliment.
[Alfred]
Your triceps are especially well developed.
Mind if I feel them?
[Boucheron]
Uh... Anything you want, Prince Alfred.
[Alfred]
Hmm, yes. Incredible stuff!
[Alfred]
They're practically a Firenese national treasure.
The forearm is perfectly sculpted too.
[Alfred]
Wish mine was like that.
[Boucheron]
Are you finished now?
[Alfred]
Oh! Guess I got carried away there.
[Alfred]
You gotta admit, though. These muscle
of yours are something else.
[Alfred]
I can't help but wonder what the secret is to
getting beauties like these.
[Boucheron]
Nothing special, really.
[Alfred]
Aww, that's what you always say.
[Alfred]
There must be some trick to it. Unless you're
telling me they're all-natural.
[Alfred]
How is that possible?!
[Alfred]
Hmm... Hm, hm, hm. Hmm...
[Boucheron]
...
[Boucheron]
That's a bit, er...
[Alfred]
A bit what? Is there something special about
this one?
[Boucheron]
No, Prince Alfred. It's just a bit ticklish.
[Alfred]
Oh! Well, why didn't you say so?

[Alfred]
Wakey-wakey, Boucheron! The sun is rising!
[Boucheron]
Prince Alfred? Good...good morning. Are you
on an early patrol?
[Alfred]
Nope. No patrols for me today.
[Boucheron]
Then why so early?
[Alfred]
I wanted to make sure I'm here to see every
part of your day.
[Boucheron]
You want to see my day? Whatever for?
[Alfred]
To solve the mystery of those muscles,
of course.
[Boucheron]
Come again?
[Alfred]
You told me you don't do anything special to
get that buff.
[Alfred]
Which means they must come from the way you
live your life. So that's what I'm going to watch!
[Boucheron]
All right. That makes sense...of a sort.
[Alfred]
I'm glad you agree! Let's get started.
[Alfred]
You just go and do what you do naturally.
Try to forget that I'm watching everything.
[Boucheron]
Fine. If the prince doesn't mind, the first thing
I'm doing with my day is going back to sleep.
[Alfred]
Go ahead. I'll sit here and take notes.

[Alfred]
It's midday. Boucheron is reading a book.
Not seeing how this is building muscle.
[Alfred]
The book isn't even a hardcover.
[Boucheron]
No. No! Poor little Fifi...
[Alfred]
Hmm, now he's crying. What a softie.

[Alfred]
I think I'm onto something here. Fishing must be
the key to those bulging muscles!
[Boucheron]
Ha! I've got you now!
[Alfred]
But that makes no sense. I sweat harder in the
gym than he does sitting there with a pole.
[Alfred]
Sure looks like fun, though.

[Alfred]
I just don't understand.
[Alfred]
I watched you all day and never once saw you
break a sweat.
[Boucheron]
I'm sorry you didn't get anything out of it.
You've wasted your whole day on me.
[Alfred]
Oh, I wouldn't call it a waste. And I got plenty
out of it!
[Alfred]
It reminded me how nice it is to spend time
with an old friend.
[Boucheron]
That's kind of you to say, Prince Alfred.
[Alfred]
The only thing I regret is that I spent all day just
watching instead of getting in there myself!
[Boucheron]
Haha. Well, you're welcome anytime to join in
my daily routine. You're rightâ”€it would be fun.

[Alfred]
Hmm.
[Alfred]
Fishing is harder than it looks, huh?
[Alfred]
You got any tips? Like, is there a certain way
I should be pulling for maximum flex?
[Boucheron]
I'm sorry, but the only thing on my mind when
I fish is the bobber.
[Alfred]
Then, how do you do it?
[Boucheron]
Patience, I suppose.
[Alfred]
Patience. Got it. Here I go, being patient.
[Alfred]
Patient... Patient... PATIENT!
[Alfred]
Ugh...
[Alfred]
I have a better idea.
[Alfred]
We get a big net, throw it in the water, and use
those muscles to pull it out.
[Alfred]
Think of all the fish we could catch at once!
[Boucheron]
Our haul would be considerable. But what you
suggest is less "fishing" than "trawling."
[Alfred]
Yeah. You got a point there.
[Boucheron]
If fishing bores you, feel free to pursue your
own activities. I won't mind.
[Alfred]
Heh. Eh, you know me too well. Honestly, I've
never been one to sit still.
[Alfred]
But I don't want to give up on fishing either.
[Boucheron]
Why not, if I may ask?
[Alfred]
Because it's a way to spend time with
you, Boucheron.
[Boucheron]
I... I see.
[Alfred]
We've always been close, but lately we haven't
gotten much alone time.
[Alfred]
I'm doing my best to savor moments like this.
[Alfred]
So I'll sit here and keep fishing. Even if neither
of us catches anything, that's fine with me.
[Boucheron]
Heh.
[Boucheron]
You know, about my physique... I suppose I am
just naturally muscular.
[Boucheron]
But I am glad to be gifted with such a body if it
helps me look after you.
[Alfred]
Boucheron! I'm getting a tug on the line!
[Boucheron]
A big one, I'd say. Do your best not to let it
get away.
[Alfred]
I'm trying! I'm trying! But I think the line is
about to snap!
[Boucheron]
I'll help you. We'll land this fish together!
[Alfred]
With you at my side, it's practically in the bag!
Get set to get hooked, fishie!
