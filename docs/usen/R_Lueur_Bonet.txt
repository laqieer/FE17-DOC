[Bunet] 
Divine One, I must say, you have the most 
evocative eyes. This one's like a cherry tomato.
[Bunet] 
Oh, and that one, a blueberry.
[Alear] 
Um, thanks? I think... You did mean those as 
compliments, right?
[Bunet] 
Of course.
[Bunet] 
Tomatoes and blueberries are among the most 
precious treasures that nature gives us.
[Bunet] 
I am steeped in culinary traditions from all over 
the world, ergo my penchant for food analogies.
[Bunet] 
Ah...so inspiring...
[Alear] 
I guess it makes sense that a chef would see the 
world in terms of ingredients.
[Alear] 
Thank you.
[Bunet] 
No, no. It is I who should be thanking you.
[Bunet] 
For allowing me to find inspiration in your 
tomato and blueberry eyes.
[Alear] 
How impressive, Bunet─to know about so 
many dishes from around the world.
[Bunet] 
I have much more to learn! And inspiration 
strikes me in many unexpected ways.
[Bunet] 
I aspire to experience every flavor inspiration 
and to create new recipes for people to enjoy.
[Alear] 
Wow, I look forward to seeing you do that.
[Bunet] 
A chef must always be up for a culinary 
journey, wherever it may go.

[Bunet] 
Hm... What is that aroma?
[Alear] 
I don't smell anything.
[Bunet] 
It's you. You're emitting a scent that I do 
not recognize.
[Alear] 
Oh, that! I got some sauce on a bit of clothing 
at lunch.
[Alear] 
It was such a small amount, I didn't think 
anyone would notice. Sorry, I'll go change.
[Bunet] 
No, no. Please allow me to find inspiration in 
this curious scent.
[Alear] 
Oh!
[Bunet] 
This must be from a dish I'm not familiar with.
[Bunet] 
Might I ask you for a quick lick? I am not 
familiar with this dish you ate.
[Alear] 
You want to taste the sauce? On my...clothing?
[Alear] 
Oh, I know! Why don't we speak with the 
person who's on meal duty?
[Bunet] 
I'd love to know sooner than that. It's my 
culinary curiosity, you see.
[Alear] 
Still, my clothing?
[Bunet] 
I've been thinking about cooking, ingredients, 
and flavors for as long as I can remember.
[Bunet] 
And over the years, I've diligently added to my 
culinary vocabulary. Can you help?
[Alear] 
I know I said I was excited about your ambitions 
as a chef. But this one's a no.
[Alear] 
I support your finding inspiration, but there 
are limits.
[Alear] 
Besides, there's more to great cooking than 
knowing all the flavors.
[Bunet] 
I don't understand.
[Alear] 
You'll figure it out. In the meantime, I'm going 
to go change. Excuse me.
[Bunet] 
What could the Divine Dragon have meant 
by that?

[Bunet] 
Divine One. I owe you an apology for my 
rudeness the other day.
[Alear] 
We talked through it. And I got my clothing 
washed─all fine.
[Bunet] 
Yes, but what you told me─that there is more 
to great cooking than knowing all the flavors...
[Bunet] 
I dove back into my culinary training to better 
understand what you meant─what I'm missing.
[Alear] 
You did?
[Bunet] 
Yes. After we spoke, I retreated to the kitchen 
and have been cooking all this time.
[Bunet] 
I worked from morning to night to cook up 
a dish inspired by that sauce stain.
[Alear] 
Wow. All this because I spilled something 
on my clothes.
[Bunet] 
Still I could not find an answer. And as I verged 
on despair, a thought came to mind.
[Bunet] 
"How about instead of worrying about this, 
I make food the Divine One would enjoy?"
[Bunet] 
So that's what I did. And the taste of the 
resulting dish far exceeded my expectations.
[Bunet] 
That's the secret to great cooking, isn't it? 
Caring for the people you're cooking for.
[Alear] 
Absolutely! I completely agree.
[Alear] 
It's about caring for people─not knowing every 
flavor and recipe under the sun.
[Bunet] 
Divine One, I'm sorry that I made 
you uncomfortable.
[Alear] 
It's OK. I still support you, even if I had to draw 
the line.
[Alear] 
I have no doubt that one day, you will be the 
world's best chef.
[Bunet] 
Thank you.
[Bunet] 
You know, I have that dish right here, if you'd 
like to try it.
[Alear] 
Of course! I'd love to.

[Bunet] 
Divine One, I have created an entirely new dish.
[Bunet] 
If you would, please try it. I'd love to hear 
your thoughts.
[Alear] 
It certainly looks delicious. The colors are 
beautiful.
[Bunet] 
The tomatoes and blueberries you see there, 
they were inspired by your beautiful eyes.
[Bunet] 
Enjoy.
[Alear] 
All right. Thank you.
[Alear] 
...
[Alear] 
This is...incredible! It's better than anything 
I've ever tasted!
[Bunet] 
I am pleased to hear it. I was determined to 
make this dish something extraordinary for you.
[Bunet] 
When I cook with you in mind, the food tastes... 
transcendent. I would like to do so more often.
[Bunet] 
That is, I would like to cook with you in 
mind...forever...if it pleased you.
[Alear] 
Do you mean...
[Bunet] 
I mean, I would like to be your partner, 
Divine One.
[Bunet] 
If you found the food I made for you pleasing, 
that is.
[Bunet] 
But if it's inconvenient, I'll remember this dish 
fondly and return to my chef's duties.
[Alear] 
Oh... No.
[Alear] 
That doesn't sound good at all. Please, stay. I'd 
like you to make more incredible dishes for me.
[Alear] 
Actually, Bunet, even if you didn't cook me a 
single meal, I'd want you to stay.
[Alear] 
Here, this Pact Ring...it's for you.
[Bunet] 
Thank you! The ring is beautiful...just like you.
[Alear] 
All the cooking aside, there's so much we'll get 
to learn about each other.
[Bunet] 
I am looking forward to it, .
[Bunet] 
This moment tastes of pure sweetness. But I 
will savor all the flavors we cook up together.
