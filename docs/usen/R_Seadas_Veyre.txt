[Veyle] 
Seadall, I've heard you're really good at 
telling fortunes.
[Seadall] 
I am.
[Seadall] 
Or I guess I should say...I was.
[Veyle] 
Oh. Does that mean you're...not good at 
it anymore?
[Seadall] 
Well, I guess I'd say I'm in a bit of a rut at 
the moment.
[Veyle] 
Hm. I didn't realize fortune-tellers could get 
"in a rut."
[Seadall] 
It would seem so. Sometimes you just don't 
feel it, and it shows in your readings.
[Veyle] 
I see. Well, I was thinking of asking you to tell 
my fortune.
[Seadall] 
Is something troubling you?
[Veyle] 
Sort of. I've been very tired lately. I was hoping 
there might be some special way to fix it.
[Seadall] 
I see. I'm afraid I can't be of much help 
right now.
[Veyle] 
Is there anything you can do to get your 
fortune-telling powers back?
[Seadall] 
I don't really know. I think I just have to wait 
for it to come back when it's ready.
[Veyle] 
...
[Veyle] 
Well, how about you tell my fortune anyway? 
I won't mind if you get it wrong.
[Seadall] 
What? But why?
[Veyle] 
Humor me. I'll just assume your reading 
is incorrect.
[Seadall] 
If that's what you want. Let's begin...
[Seadall] 
...
[Seadall] 
All is revealed. Go to the market and act like a 
cat. Good fortune shall be given you back.
[Veyle] 
Act like a cat...in the market? That's a little bit 
strange, isn't it?
[Seadall] 
Definitely strange. I told you I'm all out of sorts. 
Just pay it no mind. It won't come true.
[Veyle] 
Hehe, if you say so.

[Veyle] 
Seadall! Your fortune the other day. It was right!
[Seadall] 
What do you mean?
[Veyle] 
I did what you said. I went to the market and 
pretended to be a cat. That is, I meowed a lot.
[Seadall] 
Really? But I told you to ignore my reading.
[Veyle] 
I thought I'd give it a try. You know, just for fun. 
But then, something amazing happened.
[Veyle] 
I meowed and meowed, and I sounded so much 
like a cat, all the mice fled from the market.
[Veyle] 
It made everyone at the market very happy...so 
happy, they gave me tasty treats to say thanks!
[Veyle] 
It was all so exciting that suddenly I wasn't the 
least bit tired anymore. Your fortune was right!
[Seadall] 
Really? It felt so...off when I said it. But if it was 
right on the mark, then...I'm back.
[Seadall] 
Though, I don't think I'll be spreading that bit 
of news around.
[Veyle] 
What do you mean?
[Seadall] 
You're very kind, Lady Veyle. You really are.
[Seadall] 
I lose my confidence, and you go and make up 
this adorable story just to cheer me up.
[Seadall] 
And it has cheered me up, so thank you.
[Veyle] 
Don't say that. I'm telling the truth! I really am!
[Veyle] 
I will be very mad if you don't believe me!
[Seadall] 
OK, OK. If it's going to be like that, then... 
I believe you. Satisfied?
[Seadall] 
Now, since I've done as you asked and believed 
your story, allow me to read your fortune again.
[Veyle] 
If that's what you want, of course.
[Seadall] 
...
[Seadall] 
All is revealed. Under a full moon, gather petals 
glowing gold. Then comes true a wish so bold.
[Veyle] 
Gather flower petals...that are golden and 
glowing...when there's a full moon?
[Veyle] 
How strange. I don't really understand what it 
means, but I guess I can try.

[Veyle] 
Look at these flower petals here. How strange. 
It's almost like Seadall's fortune said.
[Seadall] 1 

[Seadall] 
Under a full moon, gather petals glowing gold. 
Then comes true a wish so bold.
[Seadall] 
The flowers you have there... I see you 
remembered my fortune.
[Veyle] 
But the flower petals are white, not gold.
[Seadall] 
Are they? Hold them up to the full moon.
[Veyle] 
Hm? Like this?
[Veyle] 
...
[Veyle] 
Oh, how lovely! They're shining gold.
[Seadall] 
Those flowers only bloom on the night of a 
full moon.
[Seadall] 
The petals appear white but then shimmer gold 
when the moonlight strikes them.
[Veyle] 
They're so pretty!
[Seadall] 
Their fragrance is thought to have a soothing 
power as well.
[Seadall] 
I'd be happy if they could ease your pain even a 
little, Lady Veyle.
[Veyle] 
...
[Veyle] 
Thank you, Seadall. You went to a lot of 
trouble to do this for me.
[Seadall] 
I don't know what you mean.
[Veyle] 
Don't be silly. You put together this whole 
beautiful act just for me, didn't you?
[Seadall] 
I assure you I had nothing to do with it. Also... 
A fortune-teller never reveals his secrets.
[Veyle] 
Oh, please...
[Seadall] 
Now, I've repaid the favor.
[Veyle] 
What favor?
[Seadall] 
Thanks to your kind gesture before, my fortune- 
telling skills are back and as sharp as ever.
[Veyle] 
That's wonderful. I'm very happy for you.
[Veyle] 
You know, Seadall, the moon is pretty tonight, 
isn't it?
[Seadall] 
It is. Very. I don't think I'll ever forget how 
beautiful it looks tonight.
[Veyle] 
No. I don't think I will either.
[Veyle] 
Under a full moon, gather petals glowing gold. 
Then comes true a wish so bold.
[Veyle] 
My wish is to bring peace and happiness to this 
world. And also...
[Veyle] 
I wish for your happiness too, Seadall.
[Seadall] 
Sorry, did you say something?
[Veyle] 
No. I'm sure you're just hearing the sound of 
flowers blooming in the night.
