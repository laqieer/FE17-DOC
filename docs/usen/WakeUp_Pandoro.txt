I never thought the day would come that I'd be 
allowed to approach the altar.


So, I'm...supposed to wake the Divine Dragon?
A frightening thought...but...
I mustn't let the Divine Dragon oversleep.
Steel yourself, Pandreo... Ahem! Divine One!


Ah, I see you are awake!
What a divine sight...
As a cleric, I have no choice but to pray.


Divine One, good morning!
If you don't mind...
I'd like to offer up a prayer.


--- C2 ---

I have purified my mind and body. Only now 
may I enter such a holy place...


What a beautiful altar.
Ooo, I could throw an epic party here.
No!
I mustn't think such wicked thoughts or the 
Divine Dragon will sense them.


Gah!
D-Divine One!
I only meant to say a prayer.
Pandreo, you party-loving fool!


Oh no.
My purification rituals failed.
Forgive me, Divine One.
This befouled follower never meant to offend 
your senses.

Divine One! AROOO!


Woo!
No more snoozing for you!
I'm usually nervous here. But not today!
Nope. Still nervous. And now, disrespectful too.


Aaaah!
I'm sorry, Divine One!
Please forgive my forced enthusiasm!
You don't...have a confession booth in here, 
do you?!


Ugh.
That was weird, huh?
It's just...
sometimes this place makes me nervous.
I'm sorry if I was rude.

"When the dragon child rises from their slumber 
on the dais, saved the world will be." Hm.


I never believed that prophecy would 
come true like...this.
When the priest talked about the 
"dragon child"...
I always pictured, you know, a small child.
But the prophecy actually turned out...


Oh! You heard all that?!
What was I about to say?
Well, I was going to say, the prophecy turned 
out better than I imagined.
I don't mean any disrespect. It's just nice we 
get to be friends.


Sorry.
I was thinking about that prophecy...
and decided to come here.
I want you to know...
it saved me. It really did.


--- A1 ---

Divine One, please permit me to break 
this silence for a moment...


It's so quiet here, as if all that fighting 
never happened.
Perhaps my prayers can reach the sky 
from here...
can reach those who have gone on to 
become stars.
We pray, please grant peace to all those 
lost souls.


I'm sorry for waking you.
It's just that after a battle... After I've stained 
these hands of mine...
prayer brings me comfort...
even if it doesn't bring me forgiveness.


Oh, sorry.
I just felt the need to pray after battle.
You don't mind?
Thank you for understanding.
Your kindness never ceases to amaze me.

Divine One! AR-AROOO!


Hmm...
I'm so happy to be here, I want to howl.
And the Divine Dragon seems to like it.
But it's so crass and unbecoming.


Ah, Divine One.
Thank you for attending the party the 
other day.
Thanks to you it was a total success and...
Huh? What's that look for?
OK. Fine. But only because you asked for it.
AROOO!


Good morning.
Uh, so, at that party the other day...
you heard everyone howling.
Sometimes we just can't help it.
I...hope that's OK.

Divine One, it's time to get up.
A clear, beautiful day awaits.


It still feels like a dream, you know?
You, the Divine Dragon, gave me─ME─the 
Pact Ring.
Every time I look at it, I get so happy I think 
I might start crying.
Oh, I know I'll become a star in the heavens 
long before you do.
But you and I, we have a bond.
And I know my hand will hold your 
hand forever.


Morning.
Come, it's time for battle.
No matter how many lives I have to take...
I'll gladly face the judgment that awaits...
if it means protecting you.


Good morning, Divine One.
What do you mean I'm being too formal 
with you? We'll see about that...
Good morning, to you whom I very much adore.
I hope that will suffice, my dear Divine One.


--- S2 ---

AROOO!
Ugh. It's still awkward around the 
Divine Dragon.


I mean...
my own deity gave me the Pact Ring.
I can't just, you know...
be casual about it all of a sudden.
It's probably going to take some time to get 
used to. Like, maybe a lot of time.
But I don't mind.
I like that awkward squeeze I feel in my heart 
every time I think about you.


Good morning.
You heard all that?!
Hm, that's embarrassing.
But when it comes to my feelings...
I don't want to hide them anymore.


I'm sorry.
I just lose my cool whenever I'm here.
I can't help it. I have some very, very 
strong feelings.
I hope you can forgive me.
