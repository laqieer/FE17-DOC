=== Diamant & Amber ===

[Amber]
Prince Diamant! Check this out. I got my hands
on a legendary secret potion!
[Amber]
One whiff of this baby is supposed to make you
spill your deepest, truest feelings...
[Diamant]
Amazing. We could use this to extract plans and
information from enemies. Well done, Amber!
[Amber]
Thanks! I'll go put it somewhere safe. I would
hate for something to happ─
[Amber]
Waaagh!
[Diamant]
Oh. There goes that bottle. You OK?
[Amber]
Ugh...
[Amber]
Prince Diamant... I... I must tell you how I feel.
[Diamant]
Oh no. You must have caught some of the
fumes from that potion.
[Amber]
Prince Diamant... Thank you so much for
letting me be your retainer.
[Amber]
If it weren't for you...I'd probably be on an
alpaca ranch.
[Amber]
I'm so grateful to you and respect you so,
so much. Like, really a lot.
[Amber]
I think you're the greatest, because...b-because
you...ugh. Ugh.
[Amber]
Huh?
[Diamant]
Amber?
[Amber]
What's up, Prince Diamant? Wait, was I just
talking a bunch? My head feels fuzzy.
[Diamant]
You don't remember? The potion worked.
You were pouring your heart out just now.
[Amber]
Whoa! No way! What did I say?
[Diamant]
Well...it would be embarrassing to repeat, to be
honest. Let's talk about this later.
[Amber]
Oh. Sure. Understood. I'll, uh, talk to you later.

[Diamant]
Hey, Amber. I'm ready to talk about that secret
potion incident.
[Amber]
Oh, right! I can't wait to hear what I said.
[Diamant]
So, you said you're grateful to me and you
respect me─an extreme amount, apparently.
[Amber]
Haha, is that all? Aw, you knew that
stuff already!
[Diamant]
True. You're not shy about that. You've gone
out of your way to save me many times.
[Diamant]
But there was something else you said...
[Diamant]
Something about how, if it weren't for me, you
would probably be on an alpaca ranch?
[Amber]
Yeah, that checks out. My family owns an
alpaca ranch back home.
[Amber]
That's all my hometown has─alpacas and cliffs.
To become a big hero, I knew I'd have to leave.
[Amber]
You opened a path for me to become that hero
as your retainer. That's why I'm so grateful.
[Diamant]
I see. Well, it's a shame that secret potion is
gone, but at least it wasn't a total loss.
[Diamant]
I was a bit embarrassed in the moment, but
I got to hear your deepest, truest feelings.
[Amber]
Yeah. I'm kind of embarrassed too, but I'm glad
I got a chance to share my appreciation.
[Amber]
Was that it? Did I say anything else?
[Diamant]
Now that you mention it, there was one last
thing before you snapped out of it.
[Diamant]
You said you thought I was "the greatest," but
trailed off before explaining why.
[Diamant]
What were you going to say after that?
[Amber]
Hm. That's a tough one. I do think you're really
great, Prince Diamant...for lots of reasons.
[Amber]
I'm not sure what the deepest, truest reason is...
Can I think about this for a while?
[Diamant]
Please do.
--- A ---


[Diamant]
Amber, please don't leave me in suspense any
longer. I need to know what you meant before.
[Amber]
You mean about the "deepest, truest" reason
why I think you're the greatest?
[Diamant]
Indeed.
[Amber]
I think I've got it. I was gonna say, "You're the
greatest...because you're like a human alpaca!"
[Diamant]
What? An alpaca?!
[Amber]
Yeah! I've felt that about you since day one,
so that has to be it.
[Diamant]
Since day one?
[Amber]
It was the day of the tournament, remember?
My family didn't want me to enter, but I did.
[Amber]
I lost to Jade...but got second place! Folks back
home called it the "alpaca-country miracle."
[Diamant]
I don't remember you being quite as thrilled at
the time. Didn't you leave the arena weeping?
[Amber]
Yeah... I wanted to be the champion so bad.
[Amber]
I was sobbing in a corner when you walked over
and asked me to be your second retainer.
[Amber]
You were smiling down at me so gently...
That was when it hit me.
[Amber]
This man...has the soul of an alpaca.
[Diamant]
THAT was what hit you?
[Amber]
I decided, right then and there, to stand beside
you and protect you.
[Diamant]
...
[Amber]
What's up? Why the funny face?
[Diamant]
I'm just...not sure which parts of me make you
think of an alpaca.
[Amber]
Oh. Well, it's a few things. How can I explain...
[Amber]
You're kind, you put me at ease, and I want to
protect you. And you're all light and fluffy!
[Diamant]
Did you just call me...light and fluffy?
[Amber]
I know. High praise. Not everyone understands
how strongly I admire alpacas.
[Diamant]
So, it's a compliment...
[Amber]
Totally.
[Diamant]
Huh. OK... I'll track down another secret potion.
Then I'll know if you're being honest with me.
[Amber]
Huh?!
[Diamant]
Haha! I'm joking. If you say you feel that
strongly, I believe you.
[Diamant]
It's an honor to be held in alpaca-level regard.
I'm glad you're my retainer, Amber.
[Amber]
Thanks, Prince Diamant. It's an honor to stand
with you. That's the truth─no potion required!
