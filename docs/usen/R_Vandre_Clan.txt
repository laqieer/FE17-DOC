=== Vander & Clanne ===

[Clanne]
I picked up the letters like you asked, Vander.
[Vander]
Ah, yes. Set them down over there, will you?
[Clanne]
I also brought a letter opener. Thought you
might need it.
[Vander]
Very good. Thank you.
[Vander]
Clanne, before I forget. Will you deliver
this package?
[Clanne]
Oh... Yes, sir.
[Vander]
Answering letters... Hmph! A man of my age
should put his fighting hand to nobler purposes.
[Clanne]
...
[Vander]
Is something the matter?
[Clanne]
Wha? Oh, uh, no. Everything's...hunky-dory.
[Vander]
Well then, why are you standing there gawking?
I told you to deliver that package.
[Clanne]
Y-yes, sir...
[Vander]
On with it, then. A faithful servant of the Divine
Dragon wastes no time.
[Clanne]
...
[Clanne]
If you gave me some real steward work to do,
maybe I'd take it more seriously...
[Vander]
Pardon?
[Clanne]
N-nothing! I'll deliver that package for you
right away, sir.

[Clanne]
I don't get it. I'm always going the extra mile to
impress Vander.
[Clanne]
Why doesn't he ask me to do any real
steward work?
[Clanne]
He must not trust me... Doesn't think I can
handle it.
[Vander]
Clanne!
[Clanne]
Y-yes, sir!
[Vander]
I need you to pass along a message to the
church nearby.
[Clanne]
...
[Vander]
If I have said it once, I have said it a thousand
times. Respond promptly when spoken to.
[Clanne]
Vander, am I just...your errand boy?
[Vander]
Beg pardon?
[Clanne]
How can I become a great steward if you won't
let me do any actual work?
[Vander]
What? Listen, Clanne, the work of a steward isâ”€
[Clanne]
"Far beyond your meager abilities!"
[Clanne]
I get it. I won't amount to anything. Why waste
your time properly training me?
[Vander]
What are you talking about?
[Clanne]
Nothing. I'll do what you say and speak when
spoken to. Vander's little helper, that's me!
[Clanne]
One message to the church, coming right up.
[Vander]
Wait! Clanne, listen!
[Vander]
Clanne!

[Clanne]
...
[Vander]
And the other day... You should know better
than to run off when your superior is speaking!
[Vander]
I swear, sometimes...
[Clanne]
Hmph...
[Vander]
Ahh... No, this won't do. This is my fault.
[Vander]
Clanne, you have my apologies.
[Clanne]
Your what?
[Vander]
Allow me to state it plainly. I have the highest
of hopes for you.
[Vander]
After all, someday I will confer all of my
responsibilities upon you and your sister.
[Clanne]
So then... How come you never trust me with
any of the actual work?
[Vander]
This is the actual work.
[Clanne]
But... But...
[Vander]
I ask you to help me with my steward duties
precisely because I trust you.
[Vander]
Sending letters, taking messages to churches...
Mundane errands, yes. But critical nonetheless.
[Clanne]
Huh...
[Vander]
It seems I never properly conveyed that to you.
[Clanne]
I... I'm sorry, Vander. I guess I kinda jumped
to conclusions.
[Vander]
No, the fault is mine. I failed to take your
feelings into account.
[Vander]
I am nothing if not grateful for your assistance.
I hope this will not discourage you.
[Clanne]
Not even close. I still wanna be a great steward
like you!
[Clanne]
So don't go too easy on me, all right?
[Vander]
Of course. I should say the same. If you have
any concerns, do not hesitate to let me know.
