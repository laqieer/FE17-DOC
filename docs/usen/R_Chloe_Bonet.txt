[Chloé] 
Please, Bunet?
[Bunet] 
Apologies, Chloé, but no. I cannot. I will not.
[Chloé] 
Pretty please? There's no one else here who 
could do it.
[Bunet] 
You have my answer.
[Chloé] 
Aww...
[Bunet] 
Chloé, I live by certain principles.
[Bunet] 
Chief among them? That the ingredients of this 
world deserve to be treated with dignity.
[Bunet] 
I refuse to twist and corrupt them in order to 
make that...side-street dreck!
[Chloé] 
Hey! I'm not taking that lying down. Folk food 
is an art form.
[Chloé] 
Unique dishes, cooked without fuss, using 
ingredients that are unusual, cheap, or both.
[Chloé] 
Imagine how amazing it would be if a world- 
class chef like you prepared some!
[Bunet] 
No. You will have to ask someone else.
[Chloé] 
But you have to!
[Chloé] 
I'll do you a favor in return if I can try some 
gourmet-quality folk food, just once.
[Bunet] 
Chloé... You know an artist when you see one. 
I appreciate that.
[Bunet] 
But I cannot do as you ask.
[Bunet] 
The ingredients tell me how they want to 
be prepared. I will not violate their wishes.
[Bunet] 
Now, if you'll excuse me.
[Chloé] 
Oooh... This isn't over. I'll find a way to 
convince him. Guaranteed!

[Bunet] 
Chloé. Here to beg me some more, I take it.
[Chloé] 
Sure am!
[Bunet] 
From where did this bizarre love of folk food 
spring? You grew up in a noble family.
[Chloé] 
Yeah, and all they served me back home was 
high cuisine.
[Chloé] 
For most people, that would be great. But me, 
I went to this Firenese festival one day.
[Chloé] 
I caught this salty-sweet scent from a back 
alley, so I followed it to find out what it was.
[Bunet] 
That was how you discovered folk food.
[Chloé] 
Yep. Without even thinking, I bought some food 
from the stall and tried it.
[Chloé] 
It was mind-blowing! The flavor, the smell, the 
texture... I'd never had anything like it in my life.
[Bunet] 
To the child of a rich family, I see how it could 
offer some...perverse sense of thrill.
[Chloé] 
Sadly, there was no chance my family would 
let me dine out.
[Chloé] 
And I could forget about folk food! They'd be 
horrified to know I ever even tasted it.
[Bunet] 
Oh, I see. You couldn't eat it while you lived 
at home.
[Chloé] 
Not necessarily. Once I'd had my first taste, 
I started going out behind my parents' backs.
[Chloé] 
I'd eat the folk food on my pegasus and get 
rid of any evidence by tossing the wrappers.
[Bunet] 
Littering, you mean.
[Chloé] 
Yeah, I feel bad about that now. I always take 
care to toss my trash properly these days.
[Chloé] 
But that's my story in a nutshell.
[Bunet] 
Your passion for food...I recognize it. I hesitate 
to admit, it is much like my own.
[Bunet] 
You have persuaded me. For you─and only 
you─I will try my hand at making folk food.
[Chloé] 
You mean it?!
[Bunet] 
But what I cook will be of the highest quality.
[Bunet] 
I cannot cut corners on purpose, so do not 
complain if it differs from your expectations.
[Chloé] 
No complaints, I promise! Thanks, Bunet! 
You've made me a very happy lady.
[Chloé] 
Ooh, I can't wait to try your first batch of 
folk food!

[Bunet] 
As I have told you before, ingredients tell me 
how to cook them.
[Chloé] 
Yeah, so you've said.
[Bunet] 
I never disregard their voices.
[Bunet] 
Thus I have been searching high and low.
[Bunet] 
I have sought out ingredients that ask─indeed, 
beg─to be made into folk food.
[Chloé] 
Does that mean you found some?
[Bunet] 
Yes. Look.
[Bunet] 
A shellfish from the ponds of Solm and some 
mushrooms unique to the queendom's forests.
[Chloé] 
Wow! What a weird color.
[Bunet] 
And this? A numbing spice. It will stamp out all 
sensation as soon as it hits your tongue.
[Chloé] 
A spice...that numbs?
[Bunet] 
Heh, you're not scared, are you?
[Chloé] 
Who, me? I want to try this so bad that I can 
hardly stand it.
[Bunet] 
I knew your culinary courage would not falter.
[Bunet] 
Now, behold. The ultimate folk food.
[Chloé] 
Incredible! That's exactly the kind of careless 
presentation folk food oughta have!
[Bunet] 
The splendor does not stop at its presentation. 
Please, have a taste.
[Chloé] 
Oh boy, oh boy...
[Chloé] 
Oh my goodness! That spice sure did a number 
on my tongue.
[Chloé] 
But the sauce brings it right back to life, and 
the texture is just...indescribable!
[Chloé] 
This is what made me fall in love with folk food. 
If a stall sold it, I'd eat there every day!
[Bunet] 
It's strange... At first, I was simply moved by 
your passion for food.
[Bunet] 
But now I see that this was a necessary step on 
the road to gastronomic expertise.
[Bunet] 
Whether it is served on a porcelain plate or in an 
unassuming wrapper, good food is good food.
[Bunet] 
Street fare and gourmet food alike can bring joy 
to their eaters.
[Chloé] 
Exactly! Thanks, Bunet.
[Bunet] 
Now, what would you like to eat next?
[Chloé] 
You mean you'll fix me something else?!
[Bunet] 
I am always happy to take requests from a true 
food lover.
[Chloé] 
No kidding? More gourmet-quality folk food... 
I'm so happy I might cry.
[Bunet] 
Please don't do that. My food and I are not 
going anywhere.
[Chloé] 
Yeah. Good point. I'll take my time and 
think carefully.
[Chloé] 
The next folk food I get from you is going to 
be the stuff of legend!
