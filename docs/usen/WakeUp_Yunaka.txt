Zappy morning, Divine One!


Not gonna make this easy, huh?
OK. Let's get serious.
Time to break out my rooster impression!
Caw-caw-doodle-do!


Hi!
Hehe, what?
That's ridiculous. Of course there aren't any 
roosters in here.
Maybe you dreamed it?


Hi! You're up!
It was my turn to wake you.
So...mission accomplished!


--- C2 ---

Surprise, Divine One! It's Yunaka!


Hmm...
Maybe I'm too easygoing.
Let's try someone more strict. Ahem...
"Divine One! You must wake at once!"


Aha!
So you get up right away for Sir Vander...
But you snooze right through Yunaka?!
I see how it is!


Up and at 'em!
Feeling rested?
Well, my work here is done...
so...have a good one! See ya!

I wonder what's in the Divine Dragon's room...
Let's get sneaky!


Fancy decor, sacred altar...just what you'd 
expect so far.
All this stuff's so nice, though. 
Ooo, what's this?
Didn't think I'd find a musical instrument in 
here. Should I give it a try?


Morning!
Do you like music?
You know...
I play a little myself.
Maybe I'll show you sometime.


Ah! You're awake?!
I, uh, I took a wrong turn! You know me, 
always...getting lost.
I'll get out of your hair.


--- B2 ---

Haah... I've gotta stop lying all the time.
What an awful habit...


I gabbed at someone for an hour yesterday 
about my dog.
I've never had a dog! I'm a cat person!
So now I gotta remember who I told about the 
dog, what its name is, keep my story straight...


I've made up my mind, Divine One.
I'm going to work on being more honest.
Starting with the small, pointless lies. No more 
bad habits.


Ah! Was I too loud?!
I'm sorry─I didn't mean to wake you so soon.
I can fix this. One little bump on the noggin...
and you'll be back asleep in no time.


--- A1 ---

Fast asleep, I see.
It doesn't look like anything could wake you.


Ah... Hello, Divine One.
I worry about you. Someone could just walk 
right in here.
And if that someone had my set of skills...
it would be all too easy to take your life.


Oh! Morning, Divine One!
Huh? You heard a stranger's voice?
There's no one else here.
Maybe you imagined it?


Wow, I was wrong!
You're a light sleeper after all. I'm impressed.
Guess we don't have to worry about any thugs 
getting the jump on you!


--- A2 ---

Divine One! Hey, Divine One!
I've got something to─ Oh, you're asleep.


I was gonna tell you all about this dagger 
I found at the market.
Full flat grind, polished steel like you've 
never seen...
A vintage fishtail pommel and a point to take 
your eye out!


And you wouldn't believe the scabbard on 
this thing.
The engravings alone are pure art...
Oh─ Hey, how long have you been awake?


No, no!
It's silly. Don't worry about it─go back to sleep.
What? You're staying up...just to chat with me?
That's really nice. Thank you.


--- S1 ---

Zappy! Only me.
Sorry your partner's not more glamorous.


Hehe, you're fierce on the battlefield, but 
you sleep like a little kitten.
It's weird, being with you...
Since you accept all of me, past and present...
For the first time in my life, I feel whole.
Is this what it's like to be accepted for who I 
truly am?
Thank you for showing me. I never would 
have known.


Huh? I'm different than usual?
Maybe you're right. But if that's true...
It's because I'm holding nothing back.
Whatever else I am, I'll always be your partner.


Hehe, flew out of bed the second I came 
along, didn't you?
I don't want to assume anything, but...
Were you excited to see me?


--- S2 ---

Hehe! Ready or not, here I come!


Still asleep? You're bad at this game.
That's what I like about you, though. 
You never hide.
The more time we spend together, fighting 
back to back...
the more I feel that honesty of yours rubbing off 
on me.
I'm so grateful to you.
Now that I've come to terms with my past, I can 
finally look forward to the future.


I have a new secret for you.
I'm enjoying life so much more now.
But what I like most of all...
is spending time with you.


Found you! Not that it was hard.
I'm usually the one hiding.
But with you, I don't have to hide anymore.
Thank you for letting me be my truest self.
