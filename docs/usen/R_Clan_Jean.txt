[Jean] 
Oh, dash it all! Face it, Jean. You're lost.
[Jean] 
It'll cause a fuss if I don't get back soon.
[Jean] 
...
[Clanne] 1 
[Clanne] 
Jean? Is everything all right?
[Jean] 
Oh... Uh, hello, Clanne.
[Clanne] 
Were you crying? Did something happen?
[Jean] 
I...I wasn't crying. I was just a bit anxious from 
losing my way, that's all.
[Jean] 
Our forces are getting hurt quite a lot lately. 
I came here to forage for healing herbs.
[Clanne] 
Oh! Really? That's very helpful of you.
[Jean] 
I found the herbs I needed, but then I got caught 
up in my work, and the next thing I know...
[Clanne] 
You got lost.
[Jean] 
What about you, Clanne? Why are you here?
[Clanne] 
I'm here for herbs too. The kind I need to 
make pickles.
[Jean] 
Oh. So, uh...do you know the way back?
[Clanne] 
Oh, yes! I come here a lot, so I can help get 
you back safely.
[Jean] 
That would be very kind of you.
[Clanne] 
You have to pay close attention to your 
surroundings when going into the forest alone.
[Jean] 
You're right, of course. I'll be more careful 
next time.
[Clanne] 
Good thing I happened to run into you, huh? 
Let's go home.
[Jean] 
Thank you, Clanne.

[Jean] 
Say, Clanne, do you remember how you helped 
me when I got lost gathering herbs?
[Clanne] 
Mm-hmm.
[Jean] 
As luck would have it, I found a use for them 
when I met a wounded child near our last battle.
[Jean] 
Treatment was simple with the herbs 
I'd collected.
[Clanne] 
Well, that's great news!
[Jean] 
I hate to think what would have become of the 
poor child if I'd stayed lost in that forest.
[Jean] 
You helped them as much as I did, Clanne. 
So, thank you for that.
[Clanne] 
Oh, I didn't do much. I just gave you directions.
[Jean] 
But your help then rippled outward.
[Jean] 
The child was from a poor family. I don't think 
a visit to the doctor was in the cards.
[Jean] 
If I hadn't come along with those herbs, the 
wound might have gone septic.
[Clanne] 
Yeesh.
[Jean] 
I may have sniffled a bit, but I didn't really think 
getting lost was that big a deal.
[Jean] 
But when a doctor is waylaid, lives could hang 
in the balance. Every second counts.
[Jean] 
I really must be more careful.
[Clanne] 
Jean, I'm not saying you're wrong, but don't 
beat yourself up too much.
[Clanne] 
Everybody has bad days.
[Clanne] 
But if you ask yourself, "How did I get myself 
into this?" you can prevent it next time.
[Clanne] 
Though I always seem to make the same 
mistakes as a Steward of the Dragon...
[Jean] 
Mistakes? You? I can't picture it. You always 
seem so sure of yourself.
[Clanne] 
Oh, not at all. I'm still just an apprentice.
[Clanne] 
There are so many people older than me here 
that I'm glad to have someone closer to my age.
[Jean] 
Hm...
[Clanne] 
Oh no, did I say something wrong?
[Jean] 
No, no! I'm happy to hear that. I always thought 
I was a burden to people.
[Jean] 
So I'm glad to hear someone is happy to have 
me around.
[Clanne] 
I don't think it's as bad as you fear.
[Jean] 
You wait and see, Clanne. I'm going to be just 
as good as you someday!

[Clanne] 
Ow!
[Jean] 
Clanne! Are you OK?!
[Clanne] 
I'm fine. I just fell and got a scrape.
[Jean] 
Even a minor scratch could get infected if 
left untreated.
[Jean] 
Show me and I can treat it for you right here.
[Clanne] 
All right.
[Jean] 
It's bleeding a bit. I can fix that.
[Clanne] 
Yeesh, that stings!
[Jean] 
Don't worry, I'm finished already. That wasn't 
so bad, was it?
[Clanne] 
Heh, thank you.
[Jean] 
No need for thanks. It's the least I could do to 
repay you.
[Clanne] 
Huh? For what?
[Jean] 
One thing you said to me last time stuck.
[Jean] 
About learning from your mistakes so you don't 
go repeating them.
[Clanne] 
That does ring a bell.
[Jean] 
It was such genuine advice. Like something 
I'd hear from my family back home.
[Clanne] 
Thanks, Jean...
[Jean] 
You know I come from an island in Firene. This 
place is nice, but it doesn't feel like home.
[Jean] 
But what you said helped to change that.
[Clanne] 
Huh.
[Clanne] 
If you miss your family, Jean, you can think 
of me as an older brother.
[Clanne] 
I might still slip up on occasion, and I have a 
lot of growing left to do, but...
[Jean] 
There's nothing wrong with that. If I had a big 
brother like you, there's nothing I would fear.
[Clanne] 
Ha! I'd be happy to help.
[Jean] 
It's nearly dinner time. How's that scratch? 
Do you need help walking?
[Clanne] 
It's feeling a lot better now. Your treatment did 
the trick.
[Jean] 
Maybe you should lean on me anyway. Isn't that 
what family is for?
