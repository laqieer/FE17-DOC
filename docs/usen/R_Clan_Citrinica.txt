[Clanne]
That's it. Come on, little buddy. You can do it!
[Citrinne]
Clanne? What are you up to out here?
[Clanne]
Ahh!
[Citrinne]
Oh! I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to startle
you like that.
[Citrinne]
You had such a serious look. I was just curious.
[Clanne]
It's, uh, nothing. I-I wasn't doing anything.
[Citrinne]
Oh my. Was it something...private?
[Citrinne]
Don't fret. I didn't see a thing.
[Clanne]
Huh?! No! It's nothing like that!
[Clanne]
I was just...talking to a wildflower.
[Citrinne]
Why were you doing that?
[Clanne]
I found this withered flower out here and felt
bad for it, so...I propped it back up, watered it...
[Clanne]
And, little by little, it started getting better.
[Citrinne]
Haha, oh! Well, my goodness.
[Clanne]
I know, I know. It's weird to get this attached to
a single wildflower.
[Citrinne]
Not at all. I think you've done a wonderful
thing here, Clanne.
[Clanne]
Oh? You really think so? Well, uh...thank you.
[Citrinne]
Would it be all right with you if I watched over
this flower as well?
[Clanne]
Yeah! Of course!
[Citrinne]
Haha, this flower must be happy to have found
such a hard-working caretaker.

[Citrinne]
Hello, Clanne. How is our wildflower friend
doing today?
[Clanne]
It's made a full recovery! Looks pretty sturdy.
I think I'll be able to remove the support soon.
[Citrinne]
What fantastic news! It's all thanks to your hard
work and diligence, you know.
[Clanne]
It wasn't just me. You've been coming to visit
too. I'm sure that helped it grow stronger.
[Citrinne]
Oh, I only checked on it from time to time.
You put in the real effort.
[Citrinne]
That reminds me... I've been saving something
for when this flower had fully healed.
[Citrinne]
Here, Clanne. This is a reward for all your hard
work reviving that wildflower. You earned it!
[Clanne]
Oh my gosh. It's...
[Citrinne]
It's a flower brooch. Isn't it perfect?
[Clanne]
This looks...expensive. Uh, I don't think I can
accept this.
[Citrinne]
Oh, but it didn't cost that much. Besides, you
should be compensated for your efforts.
[Clanne]
I'm sorry, Citrinne. I didn't help this little
wildflower just to get some kind of reward.
[Clanne]
I hope it's not rude of me to turn it down.
It's just... Oh, I'm really sorry.
[Citrinne]
It's all right, Clanne. I promise I'm not upset.
[Citrinne]
I apologize for how I approached this situation.
It seems I've crossed the line again.
[Clanne]
What do you mean?
[Citrinne]
All of my own goodwill gestures usually end up
revealing how privileged my life has been.
[Citrinne]
I know it's something I need to address, and
I do try, but...I just can't seem to get it right.
[Clanne]
Citrinne? Are you OK?
[Citrinne]
Please, don't worry about me. I should go.
[Citrinne]
I am very happy to see the wildflower looking
so healthy. Job well done, Clanne.
[Clanne]
Aw, Citrinne...

[Citrinne]
Oh, Clanne! Fancy meeting you here.
[Clanne]
Hi, Citrinne! It's been a while.
[Citrinne]
I've been meaning to ask you about that one
wildflower. Is it still in good health?
[Clanne]
Oh. I'm afraid not. It started to wither again,
and I can't seem to help it this time.
[Citrinne]
Oh no... That's awful.
[Clanne]
No, it's OK. I think it was just time for the
flower to go. Nature's doing its job.
[Citrinne]
Don't give up, Clanne. We'll come up with a
way to fix it. Just let me think...
[Citrinne]
Perhaps I could import some nutrient-rich
fertilizer. That may be enough to...
[Clanne]
Citrinne...
[Citrinne]
Right. Of course. This isn't something that can
be fixed through a show of wealth.
[Citrinne]
But I must do something. All of your hard work
is fading away. You must be heartbroken...
[Clanne]
Actually, I'm mostly just thankful.
[Citrinne]
Why is that?
[Clanne]
Caring for that flower together ended up making
us better friends. So, yeah...I'm thankful.
[Citrinne]
Oh, Clanne... How sweet.
[Clanne]
Here, I have something to give to you this time.
[Clanne]
These are seeds from the wildflower. I picked
them before it wilted again.
[Citrinne]
So the flower can live on. Wonderful!
[Citrinne]
This is worth more than any number of jewels
or gemstones. I love it.
[Citrinne]
Would you be willing to help me plant these?
[Clanne]
Sure! We can plant them all over the Somniel.
We'll fill this whole place with wildflowers.
[Citrinne]
Yes, let's. And...Clanne? I hope you'll accept
a gift in kind.
[Clanne]
The brooch again? But I thought...
[Citrinne]
It's not a reward for hard work this time. I just
want you to have it.
[Clanne]
Heh heh, OK. If you put it that way, I accept.
Thank you, Citrinne.
[Citrinne]
And thank you for accepting it, Clanne.
