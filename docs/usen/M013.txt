[Seforia]
Divine One, royals of the three kingdoms...
Welcome to Solm Palace.
I'm Seforia, the queen of Solm.
[Alear]
It's an honor to meet you, Queen Seforia.
[Seforia]
And you. Really, it's a treat.
And a surprise! I never expected Fogado to
bring the Divine Dragon here.
Out of everything he's done on his outings,
this is the most impressive.

[Fogado]
I was just doing what any prince would do for
his queen.
[Seforia]
That's "Mom" to you. My son─tries to act so
cool, so detached.
Anyway! Those introductions when you arrived.
There were...a lot of them.
First you, Divine One, and then the Firenese,
Brodian, and Elusian royalty...
Quite the guest list! I was so overwhelmed,
I nearly fell off my throne.
[Alear]
You have my apologies. We're here about a
very important matter.
[Seforia]
Yes, you said. Fell Dragon Sombron's return.
I had no idea all that was happening.
And he created those creatures, hm? That
explains why they're so vicious.
[Alear]
But your palace hasn't been attacked by
the Corrupted? Or Elusian forces?
[Seforia]
Oh, it has. We got rid of them.
[Alear]
I see. You got rid of them...
Wait, really? All of them?
[Seforia]
You seem surprised.
[Alear]
I'm impressed. But certainly glad no one's
breached the palace.
[Seforia]
I'm sorry to hear the other countries are having
a harder time of it. And Queen Lumera...
I visited her in Lythos many times. She was
always very gracious.
Naturally, the queendom of Solm stands with
you in your war against the Fell Dragon.
[Alear]
Thank you. On that note, I have a request.
The Ring of the Radiant Hero, which was
entrusted to Solm... May I take it?
[Seforia]
Of course. I'll get it right away.
Wait... Hmm...
Where was it again?
[Alear]
...
[Seforia]
I haven't seen it for a while. Fogado, do you
know where the ring might be?
[Fogado]
No clue. Maybe it's in the doodad drawer?
[Fogado]

[Seforia]
Hm. Please, wait here a moment.
[Alear]
Oh! OK...
[Seforia]

[Ivy]
The "doodad drawer."
[Ivy]
[Alfred]
Has it been lying around in a musty cupboard
this whole time?
[Alfred]
[Diamant]
This is one of the strongest Emblem Rings.
I... I don't know what to say.
[Diamant]

[Alear]




[Seforia]
Ah, you know what? I just remembered. Timerra
took it with her.


[Alear]
Timerra?
[Fogado]
My sister. Also, the crown princess.
[Seforia]
She's set to inherit my crown...and like Fogado,
she's always out doing who knows what.
To be fair, I acted the same when I was young.
Anyway, she's been gone for days.
[Fogado]
Probably on a camping trip. Oh, that sounds
great right now.
[Alfred]
So it's true. The crown princess and prince
aren't around much.
[Alfred]
[Diamant]
And she doesn't know when they'll be back.
[Alear]
We can look for Princess Timerra. Do you have
any idea where she might be?
[Seforia]
I think she was heading to the southern desert...
in which case, she'd set up camp in the oasis.
[Alear]
All right, then. We'll head there.
[Seforia]
You know, a trip to the oasis is just what I need!
I'll pack my things.
[Fogado]
Actually, Mom, how about you stay put?
[Seforia]
Oh, all right. You kids go on without me.
If you find Timerra, do summon the Emblem,
will you? I'd love to meet him.
Be careful. It's already getting dark out.
[Fogado]
Come on, everyone─I'll lead the way!



[Timerra]
I'll be performing my favorite song with my
backup singers, Merrin and Panette!
[Merrin]
Ready.
[Merrin]

[Panette]
As am I!
[Timerra]
Hope you remember the words! And a one,
and a two...
♪Meat! Meat! Meaty meat meaaat...♪
[Barbarian] お頭Ａ 1
[Barbarian] お頭Ａ
What have we here? A bunch of pretty birds,
squawking away in the night. Hah, cheep-cheep.
[Barbarian] お頭Ｂ 3
[Barbarian] お頭Ｂ
Cheep-cheep is right. But there's nothing cheap
about the ring that one has. Let's grab it.
[Timerra]
♪Meaty, meaty, aw yeah! Meaty, meaty...♪
[Barbarian] お頭Ａ
Hey. Hey! Quit your cawing!
[Timerra]
Who're you two?
[Barbarian] お頭Ａ
Come on. Wake up! What do you think?
We're bandits. Bandits!
[Barbarian] お頭Ｂ
And what do bandits do? Take stuff! Like your
fancy ring there. Give it!
[Timerra]
Ooh!
[Barbarian] お頭Ａ
Oh? Oooh?! That's all? You're in trouble.
Really in it. Right now!
[Barbarian] お頭Ｂ
In it and surrounded by it! We've got monsters─
big fans of ours. These two and way more!
[Barbarian] お頭Ｂ
 [Corrupted] " [Corrupted] [Axe Flier]
Rrrgh...
[Timerra]
...
[Barbarian] お頭Ａ
So, we asked nicely, but you had to make us
mad. Now we'll do this our way!




[Fogado]
I saw a bonfire. That's gotta be her!
[Alear]
What were those strange sounds?
[Fogado]
Timerra and her friends singing.
[Alear]
Oh... Sorry.
[Fogado]
Haha, don't worry about it. People call them
the Racket of Solm for a reason.
Weird that they stopped. An attack, you think?
[Alear]
Let's get over there and find out.




[Fogado]
Timerra!
[Timerra]
Oh! Hey, Fogado.


[Alear]
So, you're Princess Timerra. Nice to meet you.
[Timerra]
Don't tell me! You're the Divine Dragon, right?
Fogado wouldn't have come here unless he'd
found you first.
[Alear]
He wouldn't have... What?
[Timerra]
Not important. We've got bigger steaks to roast.
Have to deal with these bandits, for a start!
It'd really help if you could use your summoning
powers on this ring.
[Alear]
The Ring of the Radiant Hero.
[Timerra]
I've always wanted to meet the person who
lives in here. Can you make that happen?
[Alear]
All right.
[Timerra]
Great! And a one, and a two...
[Alear]
Fight on, Emblem of Radiance!




[Timerra]
Dang, those arms. You're ready to fight.
[Ike]
I'm Ike. Make sure you use me wisely.
[Alear]
Thanks for your help, Ike. You'll be fighting
alongside Princess Timerra in this battle.

[Barbarian] お頭Ａ
What's that? More?! Those cheep-cheep birds
must've gone cawing for help!
Phooey, that's what I say. They won't beat
our monsters!

$ [Barbarian] お頭Ｂ
Smile
[Barbarian] お頭Ｂ
That's right. Not to mention our thieves.
Experts in the art of ransackery!

[Barbarian]
Ahahaha...


[Timerra]
They're gonna attack the village. We have to
stop them before anybody gets hurt.
Merrin, Panette, come on!
[Barbarian]
[Merrin]
As you command, my princess. We'll crush
them with the hammer of justice.
[Merrin]

[Panette]
Indeed! They shall sorely regret terrorizing these
poor, innocent people!

[Timerra]
That takes care of that. Sorry for roping you
into the scuffle, Divine One.
[Alear]
That's all right. But I haven't had a chance to
say why I'm here.
I already explained this to Queen Seforia and
Prince Fogado, but...
The Fell Dragon has been released. He's back.
[Timerra]
Hm.
[Alear]
It's sudden, I know. You're probably shocked.
[Timerra]
I already knew.
[Alear]
You did?
[Timerra]
Mom and Fogado did too. We've all known for
a while now.
[Alear]
Fogado, you too?

[Fogado]
Sorry. Truth is, our chance meeting in Tullah
Desert...wasn't totally by chance.
[Alear]
Were you deceiving us?
[Fogado]
The opposite, actually. I had to make sure that
you weren't deceiving us.
When the Fell Dragon returned, we had to take
steps to protect our country.
[Timerra]
I'll lay it out for you.
The palace has scouts all over Elyos─keeping
an eye on the three kingdoms.
When Elusia brought back the Fell Dragon,
we learned about it early on.
But we couldn't beat him without the Emblem
Rings─and we couldn't use them without you.
Our only option was to focus on defense.
The Corrupted started appearing, so we had
to quickly lay out a plan.
[Alear]
And what was the plan?
[Timerra]
First off, Mom would stay in the palace. She'd
work with the royal guard to keep out intruders.
And we'd send out our militia, the Sentinels, to
bolster soldiers' efforts against the Corrupted.
[Fogado]
As captain, my job was to watch out for the
Corrupted near the Elusian border.
If someone claimed to be the Divine Dragon,
I'd size them up and bring them to the palace.
[Alear]
That's why you hid the fact you're a prince.
[Timerra]
I was in the Sentinels too. And I wandered the
country, keeping our ring safe.
[Alear]
As part of this plan, did you ever consider
asking for another country's help?
[Timerra]
No. Because then we'd have to help them.
We can't fight another country's battles. We're
stretched thin fighting our own.
That's how Solm does it. You scratch your own
back, we'll scratch ours, thank you very much.
[Alear]
I see.
[Timerra]
I'm sorry we misled you. But we did it to
protect the queendom.
[Alear]
I don't mean to criticize your country's way of
doing things. I'm just surprised.
[Timerra]
Here's the most important part of the
plan, though.
If you did turn out to be the Divine Dragon,
we'd give you the Ring of the Radiant Hero...
And then tell you where to find our other
Emblem Ring.
[Alear]
Solm has a second ring?
[Timerra]
Yup. The Ring of the Crux of Fate. It's in the─

ソルム兵士 ソードナイト3
Your Highness! A message from Solm Palace!
[Timerra]
Huh? What is it?
ソルム兵士 ソードナイト3
Hortensia, princess of Elusia, has breached
the palace.

[Ivy]
Oh... Oh.
[Timerra]
What?! How did she get in? We have to
save Mom!
[Alear]
Let's go!
