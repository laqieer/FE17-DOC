It's morning, Divine One.


I know I'm not the ideal person to wake you.
I am not exactly upbeat.
But the sooner you wake...
the sooner this will be over.


Morning.
Good weather today.
Get some sun.
You don't want to be gloomy like me, do you?


You wake so readily.
I envy you.
I find sleeping...
and waking to be a struggle.


--- C2 ---

I wish I could visit you every morning.
But it wouldn't be appropriate.


I never thought I'd be here.
Waking the Divine Dragon...
I have no experience with this sort of thing.
I am frightfully nervous.


Good morning.
I'm not very comfortable here.
But the opportunity to greet you, first thing 
in the morning...
I couldn't pass it up.


You're awake.
I suppose I will be going, then.
I hope you get a more cheerful visitor tomorrow.
Farewell.

I've long wished for this.
To stand in the Somniel...
To pray at the holiest of altars.


Father told me...
about Queen Lumera.
She invited Elusia's royal family to visit.
They never accepted.
Until now, I suppose...


Good morning.
I came here to pray, if that's all right.
I have something to say to Queen Lumera.
Late as I may be, I accept the invitation.


...
Sorry to wake you.
I only came here to pray.
I am finished now.
Allow me to wish my deity a pleasant morning.


--- B2 ---

I hope I am allowed to be in this holy place...


Elusia may not like it...
but I worship the Divine Dragon.
As crown princess, I have been forced to keep 
that to myself.
At least until now.


I wonder...
What was it like for you to wake...
after a thousand years?
I wish I could have been here to witness it.


Morning.
I'm grateful that you accept my presence here 
without complaint.
Your kindness continues to amaze me.

This place...
I feel accepted here. Forgiven.


So much of the world is tiresome...
but I never tire of being here.
When I'm near you...
I feel I can actually relax and be myself.


Oh, you're awake.
You think something humorous must have 
happened to me?
You noticed me smiling?
Now that you mention it, I suppose I was.


Good morning.
You seem so pure in slumber. So trusting.
If that means you trust me...
I'm glad.


--- A2 ---

It's a relief to see you, Divine One.


I dreamed of...
an Elusia in ruin.
When I woke, my first thought was to come 
to you straightaway.
I knew once I laid eyes on you, there would be 
nothing to fear.


Did you hear all that?
My weakness must be appalling to you.
Yet you look at me with such kindness in 
your eyes.
You're always saving me.


Sorry to wake you.
I had a bad dream.
I suppose I came to you for comfort.
Childish, I know.

I've come to see you, Divine One.
Calling you that feels so much more meaningful 
to me now.


I have a confession.
I find myself feeling a bit jealous...
You gave me the Pact Ring...
but you've given your Emblem Ring to others 
as well.
It feels ridiculous to say this out loud, but...
I wish I were the only one devoted to you.
I know that's terribly selfish.


You're awake. Good morning.
May I come closer?
Thank you.
I cherish every moment that I'm close to you.
Every second that it's just you and me.


Ah, you're awake.
Sorry if I'm here a little early.
I couldn't wait a moment more to see you.
Our time together is everything to me.


--- S2 ---

Divine One...
You slept, just like this, for a millennium...


You know...
I owe so much to you.
I am strong enough now to endure the very 
hardest battles.
And the worst nightmares.
It's all thanks to you.
I love you, and I'll never tire of saying it.
Such a simple phrase hardly feels like enough...
but no words will ever be sufficient to convey 
my feelings.


Good morning. Were you listening to all that?
Well, good. I want you to know how I feel.
And if you ever forget, I'm happy to 
remind you...
just how much I adore you.


I'm glad you're awake.
We can't have you sleeping another 
thousand years.
I think about that moment sometimes.
You waking after so long... I wish I could have 
been there.
