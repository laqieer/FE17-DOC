[Alfred] 
Vander, I owe you an apology.
[Vander] 
An apology? What for?
[Alfred] 
I messed up big time.
[Alfred] 
If I'd been quicker about getting to Lythos, 
I could've saved Queen Lumera.
[Alfred] 
I know the queen meant a lot to you. I'm really 
sorry she's gone.
[Vander] 
You are mistaken, Prince Alfred.
[Vander] 
If there is blame to cast, I bear as much as you. 
More, in fact, as I was her retainer.
[Vander] 
So you see, you have nothing to apologize for.
[Alfred] 
But I...
[Vander] 
Without your presence, Prince Alfred, our losses 
may have been even greater.
[Vander] 
As I see it, I have ample reason to thank you 
and none to resent you.
[Alfred] 
Well, if you say so. Happy to help.
[Alfred] 
Hey, uh, is it OK with you if I visit again?
[Vander] 
Of course. Let us share stories of happier times 
with Queen Lumera.
[Alfred] 
Happier times, huh?
[Vander] 
Indeed. I think Queen Lumera would prefer that 
to brooding over our failures, don't you?

[Alfred] 
When I was little, Queen Lumera gave me 
flowers for my birthday.
[Alfred] 
They were these real pretty white flowers. 
Couldn't tell you what they were called.
[Vander] 
Windflowers, most likely. Queen Lumera was 
especially passionate about growing them.
[Alfred] 
Windflowers. I'll have to remember that.
[Vander] 
Queen Lumera once made a gift of windflowers 
for me as well.
[Alfred] 
Oh, was it your birthday too?
[Vander] 
No. There was nothing special about 
the occasion.
[Alfred] 
Oh. Hmm.
[Alfred] 
Maybe it was her way of saying, "Good work, 
my loyal retainer!"
[Vander] 
Perhaps. Such gestures were typical of 
our queen.
[Vander] 
The garden where she tended her windflowers 
was trampled into mud during the battle.
[Vander] 
Thinking about it now, I wish I had spent more 
time with the queen.
[Alfred] 
Well, we all have regrets. Nothing to do with 
them but keep moving forward.
[Alfred] 
It's up to us now to keep our people safe, just 
like Queen Lumera used to.

[Vander] 
...
[Alfred] 
What's up, Vander? Your invite caught me 
a little off guard.
[Vander] 
Have a look at this.
[Alfred] 
Are these windflowers? A whole garden full... 
but why here?
[Vander] 
I thought it would be a waste for them to grow 
only within the castle.
[Vander] 
I planted what I could find of them here, so that 
everyone may enjoy them.
[Vander] 
I must admit...I didn't expect them to thrive 
quite so much.
[Alfred] 
Heh heh, they're some real good-looking 
windflowers, I'll give you that.
[Alfred] 
When I gaze at them, I have the strangest feeling 
that Queen Lumera is here at my side.
[Vander] 
I know just what you mean.
[Vander] 
I wanted you to see the windflowers too, 
Prince Alfred.
[Alfred] 
Thanks. It means a lot, you know.
[Alfred] 
Once we get our peace back, why don't you 
and me plant even more windflowers here?
[Vander] 
Yes. We shall plant them together.
[Alfred] 
And this time, we'll make sure the garden 
stays safe.
[Alfred] 
That way, Queen Lumera can watch over her 
people from here.
[Vander] 
It is as she would wish, Prince Alfred.
