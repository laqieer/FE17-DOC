=== Lapis & Fogado ===

[Fogado]
Ah... What am I going to do?
[Lapis]
About what, Prince Fogado?
[Fogado]
Oh! Hey, Lapis. You know I'm in charge of the
Sentinels, yeah?
[Fogado]
We've got a real thorn in our side. A group of
rogues making trouble by an oasis in Solm.
[Fogado]
They're a slippery bunch. Even with our
numbers, we can't stamp them out.
[Lapis]
Have you considered making a device that will
get rid of the rogues for you?
[Lapis]
You know─something that can drive them off
without you having to lift a finger.
[Fogado]
Hm, not a bad idea. But I don't know anyone
who could make something like that.
[Lapis]
Me, of course!
[Fogado]
You?!
[Lapis]
I'm pretty crafty. Ever since I was young, I've
been able to make everything I needed.
[Lapis]
So...yeah! I bet I could whip something up.
[Fogado]
All right... Let's give it a whirl. Tell me if you
need any materials.
[Lapis]
See if you can find any trash or tree branches
lying around. That ought to do it.
[Fogado]
What? Really?!
[Lapis]
Yeah! The sooner you get that stuff, the sooner
those rogues will be out of your hair.
[Fogado]
Um, all right. I'll go trawling for...anything that
looks useful, then.
[Fogado]
Me? Desperate? No, I'm just trying to solve
my problems with a big pile of trash...

[Lapis]
Prince Fogado, look at this!
[Lapis]
I've put the finishing touches on my rogue-
repelling device. I call it...Fogado Mark II!
[Fogado]
It's...a dummy that looks like me.
[Lapis]
Exactly. Turned out well, don't you think?
[Fogado]
Actually, yeah. In silhouette, it bears quite
a resemblance.
[Lapis]
Doesn't it?
[Fogado]
You made all this from random scraps of trash?
I'll admit, I'm impressed.
[Lapis]
I couldn't have done it without your help
collecting materials.
[Lapis]
It did take a couple tries to get right. My original
prototype actually...exploded.
[Fogado]
I...see. So you're going to set this handsome─
possibly explosive─fella up at the oasis?
[Lapis]
Exactly. But it wouldn't be very effective if it
just stood there stone-still, so...
[Fogado]
Hold up. Did it just...
[Lapis]
Yup! It moves with the wind. Nifty, right?
[Fogado]
Uh...yeah. Very nifty.
[Fogado]
As much as I admire the craftsmanship, do
you really think this will scare off rogues?
[Lapis]
In the right light, I think it will be quite
intimidating.
[Fogado]
Ooo, but if they get close enough, they'll see
that it's not real.
[Lapis]
Come to think of it, you may have a point.
[Lapis]
It's based on effigies in my hometown used to
scare bears. I've never tested it on people.
[Fogado]
You know what? It's worth a shot. I can't say
I have any better ideas.
[Lapis]
All right, then. Hopefully it does the trick!

[Fogado]
Lapis, guess what? Your device worked like
a charm!
[Fogado]
With that thing's help, we caught every last one
of those rogues!
[Lapis]
Oh, really?
[Fogado]
Yup. You did say that this device was great at
warding off bears.
[Lapis]
Yes...
[Fogado]
It worked. That thing caused quite a stir among
animals inhabiting the oasis.
[Lapis]
The animals? But we were hoping to spook the
rogues, not the local wildlife.
[Fogado]
Well, as you can imagine, a horde of agitated
tigers and gators sent the rogues running.
[Fogado]
As soon as they were out in the open, we
swooped in and captured every last one.
[Fogado]
It was a perfect mission, all thanks to you!
[Lapis]
I guess we achieved the result we wanted...
even if the process was a little unorthodox.
[Fogado]
Pat yourself on the back. At the end of the day,
it was well made, and it did the trick.
[Fogado]
Now tell me, do you have devices like this
placed around your hometown?
[Lapis]
Yes. We use a variety of devices to repel bears
from my village.
[Fogado]
Yeah? How about you take me to see them
in person?
[Lapis]
Huh? Why?
[Fogado]
I'd like to take a closer look. Bet I could learn a
lot about creative defense strategies.
[Lapis]
I'm not sure how helpful it will be.
[Lapis]
But if you do want to visit, you should wear a
disguise so no one knows it's you.
[Fogado]
All right! It's a date.
[Fogado]
Hm, what disguise should I wear? Maybe some
bear fur?
[Lapis]
That might not be a good idea, unless you want
to get turned into bear stew...
