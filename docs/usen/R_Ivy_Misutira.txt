[Timerra]
Heya, Princess Ivy!
[Ivy]
Hello, Princess Timerra.
[Timerra]
Look at us, huh? Two future queens, hanging
out together like this.
[Ivy]
True. I will rule Elusia one day─and you Solm.
[Ivy]
Beyond our royal status, however, we appear to
have nothing in common.
[Timerra]
I don't know if we're all that different.
[Ivy]
No? It seems to me that our appearances and
personalities are direct opposites.
[Ivy]
Not to suggest either is superior, of course.
But the differences are plain enough to me.
[Timerra]
Hmm, I guess you have a point.
[Ivy]
I've never roamed my territory fighting bandits,
for instance. I've never even been camping.
[Timerra]
What?! You've never been camping?!
Then you've never really lived!
[Ivy]
Walls and doors were built for a reason. I see
little point in sleeping outside of them.
[Timerra]
You'll change your tune once you experience
the thrill of sleeping under the stars for yourself.
[Ivy]
Why would I...
[Ivy]
Hm.
[Ivy]
You know what? OK.
[Ivy]
It would be rude of me to refuse an invitation
from a fellow princess. I accept.
[Timerra]
Wahoo! I'll start preparing for the big day.
Get ready to have the time of your life!
[Ivy]
It does promise to be interesting.

[Ivy]
...
[Timerra]
♪Hmm hm-hm-hm! Hm-hm hmm!♪
[Timerra]
See, Princess Ivy? I knew you'd have fun!
[Ivy]
With all due respect, Your Highness, your
powers of observation...need work.
[Ivy]
Look at me.
[Ivy]
I'm in the presence of foreign royalty, yet I can't
master myself enough to stop shaking.
[Ivy]
I am─to vastly understate the matter─not
enjoying this.
[Timerra]
Oh, whoa, you are shaking. Are you cold?
I can throw more logs on the fire.
[Ivy]
No...it is not the cold.
[Ivy]
Aah!
[Ivy]
I am shaking because I am afraid.
[Timerra]
Oh! If it's wild animals you're worried about,
let me put those fears to rest.
[Timerra]
I set up a few traps just in case, but the fire
should be enough to keep them away.
[Ivy]
No. Ghosts.
[Ivy]
I'm certain I heard a strange moaning cry...
coming from that way.
[Timerra]
♪Hey, you spooky ghost! How's it going?!♪
[Ivy]
Aah! Quiet!
[Timerra]
Hehe! Sorry, sorry. But singing might make
you feel a little less scared. Why not try it?
[Ivy]
Ugh...
[Ivy]
♪Ghoooost...♪
[Timerra]
That's it! Now... ♪Of all the things to be scared
of, why ghosts and not plagues or wars?♪
[Ivy]
♪Please just forget what you saw here...
I've had enough sleeping outdoors. ♪

[Ivy]
Princess Timerra.
[Ivy]
Camping was a valuable life experience.
Thank you.
[Timerra]
You're welcome! So tell me...
[Timerra]
Did you find any weaknesses?
[Ivy]
Heh, you saw right through me.
[Timerra]
Of course. I'm a princess too, aren't I? I was
thinking the same thing.
[Timerra]
One day, when we're queens, knowing one
another's weaknesses could give us an edge.
[Ivy]
That is indeed why I decided to go along.
[Ivy]
In the end, however, the only weakness revealed
was my own.
[Timerra]
Yup! Starts with G and rhymes with roasts.
[Ivy]
And all I learned about you is that we are even
less alike than I'd supposed.
[Ivy]
I am left with only a longer list of ways in which
we're opposites.
[Ivy]
You like meat. I prefer vegetables.
[Timerra]
I love singing, but you're shy about doing it in
front of other people.
[Ivy]
I prefer to spend my time in study. You would
rather spend it running through the hills.
[Timerra]
Hehe, we really are opposites, huh?
[Ivy]
Yes. But despite that, I did appreciate our
time together.
[Timerra]
Same, honestly. I had a great time!
[Ivy]
Differences can be a source of conflict, but they
can also elevate discussion.
[Ivy]
I believe our conversations will ultimately make
me a better leader to my people.
[Timerra]
Me too. I hope we can keep being friends.
[Ivy]
Friendship is based on reciprocity. You owe me
one weakness.
[Timerra]
Hm. Hate to do it, but I guess you've painted
me into a corner.
[Ivy]
Heh heh, I jest. I would like us to be on good
terms, Princess Timerra.
[Ivy]
Let our friendship set the standard for the
relations between our countries.
[Timerra]
Agreed. Here's to a long, ghost-free friendship!
