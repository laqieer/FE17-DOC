=== Eirika & Alfred ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
You're always so lively in the mornings. The
mere sight of it is enough to fill me with energy.
[Alfred]
Yeah, I can have that effect on people! Wanna
come running with me sometime?

--- B ---





[Eirika]
Is it not hard for you to rise before daybreak?
To undergo a morning routine while still sleepy?
[Alfred]
Once, maybe, but I'm used to it. Mornings are
better when you've got your game face on!

--- A ---




[Alfred]
Emblems are weird. You're right here in front
of me, but you don't have a body.
[Alfred]
Your will is so strong that you don't need one.
Guess that's what it takes to be an Emblem.
[Eirika]
I'm not so certain. I'd consider myself a novice
and not much stronger than you.
[Eirika]
When I see how hard you drive yourself, it spurs
me to do my all to match.

=== Eirika & Anna ===

--- C ---




[Anna]
Ooo, a pretty Emblem! Welcome to my shop.
I've got all kinds of rare stuff for sale!
[Eirika]
I came to see your wares, but something about
you feels very familiar.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
You always have such interesting items for sale.
If only I could purchase any of them.
[Anna]
I normally frown on window shoppers, but if it
makes you happy, I'd be willing to let it slide.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
Just browsing through your dazzling array of
wares is enough to brighten my mood.
[Anna]
Great! Look all you want! For you, Eirika,
my stall is always open.
[Eirika]
That's nice of you. But are you sure it's not a
problem that I can't buy anything?
[Anna]
Nah. Just between us, I'm raking in the dough
from all the customers coming to see you!

=== Eirika & Bunet ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
Your cooking looks truly delicious, Bunet. I can
almost taste it just by looking at it.
[Bunet]
You can tell a dish's flavor from a single look?
Splendid! How I envy those eyes of yours.

--- B ---




[Bunet]
Eirika, please, as you can sense flavor with
your eyes, tell me... How does this dish taste?
[Eirika]
Oh! I only meant I can see your food is delicious
because I can see people smile when they eat it.

--- A ---




[Bunet]
So, you can't sense flavors with your eyes?
A shame. I so wanted you to taste my cooking.
[Eirika]
I wanted that too. But I have an idea...
[Eirika]
I will watch you cook, paying attention to every
detail. And I will imagine how each bite tastes.
[Bunet]
Use the power of imagination...to conjure the
soul of a meal? A delicious experiment indeed.

=== Eirika & Boucheron ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
I admire your form, Boucheron. I wish I had
muscles like yours.
[Boucheron]
What?! I don't know, Eirika. I've seen you fight,
and you do just fine the way you are.

--- B ---





[Boucheron]
Do you read much, Eirika? I like it because it
puts you in someone else's shoes.
[Eirika]
If everyone read as much as you do, I don't
doubt the world would be a kinder place.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
I'd like to take up reading as a hobby. But not
being able to turn the pages is an issue.
[Boucheron]
Well, if there's a book you want to read, I'd be
happy to turn the pages for you.
[Eirika]
Thank you! I'm curious about Elyos, so a history
book would be nice. Or is that too long?
[Boucheron]
No sweat. These muscles of mine could power
through a thousand pages if they had to.

=== Eirika & Céline ===

--- C ---





[Céline]
They tell me you dislike conflict, Eirika. Is it not
painful for you to wage war as an Emblem?
[Eirika]
I've made up my mind to do whatever I can if it
stops even one person from grieving.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
War takes a heavy mental toll. We must not
forget to care for those scarred by combat.
[Céline]
I find that the soothing aroma of a floral tea
does much to calm the mind. I'll prepare a pot.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
I can tell from the scent alone that your tea
is magnificent, Céline.
[Céline]
You honor me. As a princess, it's important for
me to establish a welcoming atmosphere.
[Eirika]
There's more to it than manners and etiquette,
isn't there? You wear your heart in your leaves.
[Céline]
I learned from your example. There is joy in
seeing signs that someone else cares for us.

=== Eirika & Chloé ===

--- C ---




[Chloé]
Um, Eirika? Who is that beautiful man who
shows up sometimes and looks just like you?
[Eirika]
That's my twin brother, Ephraim. Sorry if he
surprised you, but he's impressed with you too.

--- B ---




[Chloé]
Your brother's so wonderful, Eirika. He's as
gorgeous as you and every bit as strong too.
[Eirika]
I'm sure he appreciates the compliments. Wait...
Chloé, are you...

--- A ---




[Chloé]
Eirika, all I meant was that one of you is already
beautiful. Two of you would be even lovelier!
[Eirika]
I had heard that you appreciated storybook
scenes of that sort. And since we're twins...
[Chloé]
You'd look even dreamier side by side! The
trouble is, he only shows himself in battle.
[Eirika]
True enough. I know you had your heart set on
it, but I think you and I match up nicely too.

=== Eirika & Citrinne ===

--- C ---





[Citrinne]
I love to treat friends to little gifts. What can I
get for you, Eirika? Say the word and it's yours.
[Eirika]
Hehe, you're so kind, Citrinne. For now, the
offer on its own is more than enough.

--- B ---





[Citrinne]
There must be some gift I can offer you, Eirika.
Shall I buy you a mountain? Rent out the coast?
[Eirika]
Um, those would both be a bit much, but I can
sense your sincerity. Let me think it over.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
I've given it plenty of thought, Citrinne...and I've
landed on a gift idea that I would truly love.
[Citrinne]
Oh, that's marvelous! I'm so glad! Tell me, what
expression of our friendship shall I buy for you?
[Eirika]
What I would cherish most...is the knowledge
that you care for me. And I already have that.
[Citrinne]
Oh, Eirika... If that's a gift, then you've given it
right back to me. Let's both cherish it together.

=== Eirika & Clanne ===

--- C ---




[Clanne]
Wow, you're a twin too, Lady Eirika?
[Eirika]
Yes! Just like you, we're an older brother and
younger sister. We should compare experiences.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
My twin brother has always treated me like a
child, even though I was born shortly after him.
[Clanne]
Oh yeah? Wow. I'm the older one and I always
worry about my sister too.

--- A ---




[Clanne]
Twins are strange, right? We're born at the
same time, but one is always older.
[Eirika]
My brother always uses the excuse that he's
older so he can do things for me.
[Eirika]
He says being younger means getting doted on,
even if I was born at nearly the same time.
[Clanne]
If he's anything like me, he's showing you how
much he loves his twin.

=== Eirika & Diamant ===

--- C ---




[Diamant]
I heard you have a twin brother, Eirika. Did that
ever complicate the matter of succession?
[Eirika]
Not at all. I never planned to challenge my older
brother. There is no one more suited to be king.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
You've been the heir to your throne since birth,
haven't you, Diamant? How has that felt?
[Diamant]
Matters of the crown are always on my mind...
but I make sure my heart gives the orders.

--- A ---




[Diamant]
My father taught me to control through power.
Now I'm crown prince of a military juggernaut.
[Eirika]
I also had a military-minded father, so I decided
to train in the combat arts.
[Eirika]
I will be honest, I take no pleasure from drawing
a sword, but sometimes there's no other choice.
[Diamant]
I agree. Power must be used to protect people...
but it must also protect the peace that follows.

=== Eirika & Etie ===

--- C ---





[Etie]
You seem a little sluggish. You feeling OK?
A good, hard workout might be what you need.
[Eirika]
Sorry? Oh, no, I was just lost in thought. I can't
always be as ebullient as you, Etie.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
You're always so keenly focused on training.
Do you wish for greater strength that badly?
[Etie]
Getting buff isn't the only reason to work out.
It's like...a whole way of life at this point.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
I must say, Etie. The idea of working out as a
way of life has opened my mind.
[Etie]
The best part is you really get results going
about it that way!
[Etie]
Still, you've gotta focus on the process, not the
results. Wanna give it a try sometime, Eirika?
[Eirika]
I'd like that. If I see things your way, I think
I could train hard while having fun doing it!

=== Eirika & Fogado ===

--- C ---





[Fogado]
I admit, Eirika, I had no idea you were so strong!
I guess looks can be deceiving, eh?
[Eirika]
My brother has trained me well. As for you, it
seems you are just as friendly as you appear.

--- B ---





[Fogado]
So, about that guy who helps you in battle...is
he a friend of yours? I'd love to chat with him.
[Eirika]
You mean my twin brother, Ephraim? I'm sorry.
He vanishes every time a battle ends.

--- A ---





[Fogado]
Princes have a lot of expectations to live up to,
ya know? Sometimes it feels so...so confining.
[Eirika]
I think people expect great things from you
because they can see just how brilliant you are.
[Fogado]
Well, when you put it like that, I think maybe I
should work harder to meet those expectations.
[Eirika]
That is a good attitude. Though don't forget,
your relaxed nature is a good quality too.

=== Eirika & Framme ===

--- C ---




[Framme]
No way! You're a twin like me? And a younger
twin sister too? We're gonna get along so good.
[Eirika]
Hehe, I'm sure you're right. Perhaps we can
trade tips on how best to handle older brothers!

--- B ---




[Framme]
Lady Eirika, do you get along with your
brother? Sometimes it's hard for twins.
[Eirika]
We do, though I cannot say if it is thanks to our
personalities or the nature of our power.

--- A ---




[Framme]
Does your brother annoy you, Lady Eirika? Or
do you just totally love him? You can tell me.
[Eirika]
I love him, of course. He is family.
[Eirika]
But more than that, he is the person I trust and
respect the most. And that will never change.
[Framme]
That's sweet. I feel the same. I should probably
tell my brother, but it sounds sooo mushy.

=== Eirika & Goldmary ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
I often wonder why war is so commonplace.
Why are people so keen to hurt each other?
[Goldmary]
I couldn't agree more. It should be a crime to
force anyone as charming as us to fight.

--- B ---




[Goldmary]
I grew up surrounded by luxurious hot springs,
so I appreciate a good soak more than most.
[Eirika]
Hot springs must be amazing. I wonder if there
are any such places in the world I come from?

--- A ---





[Eirika]
Our talk has had me trying to remember when
I last had a good bath.
[Goldmary]
I imagine it's difficult without a body. Taking
you to the hot springs might be a little pointless.
[Goldmary]
Then again, you may not need a body to
appreciate how relaxing they can be.
[Eirika]
Interesting suggestion. We should pay your
village a visit when we get the chance.

=== Eirika & Hortensia ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
I'm very grateful to your retainers for bringing
me here.
[Hortensia]
I'm the one who should be grateful. It's a
privilege to fight alongside you.

--- B ---




[Hortensia]
Hey, Eirika. When was the last time someone
told you that you're totally adorable?
[Eirika]
I have no idea. I'm certainly not used to hearing
such things. Maybe when I was a little girl?

--- A ---




[Hortensia]
I think it's about time someone acknowledged
how pretty and charming you are, Eirika!
[Eirika]
What do you mean by "acknowledged"?
[Hortensia]
I mean this─an official certificate of beauty!
We can hang it up for you somewhere.
[Eirika]
This is certainly a first. Thank you, Hortensia.
Can we display it in the Ring Chamber?

=== Eirika & Ivy ===

--- C ---





[Ivy]
Your royal title has not compromised your
honesty, Lady Eirika. I envy that about you.
[Eirika]
What an unexpected compliment. Thank you.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
I'm often told that I'm too easy to read. I think
I'd like to learn to be a little more...cunning?
[Ivy]
Heh, interesting. If you really wish to learn, you
could try following my example.

--- A ---





[Ivy]
I suppose it's natural for each of us to envy
those who have qualities we lack.
[Eirika]
What do you think you're lacking, Princess Ivy?
[Ivy]
Everything. The more I fight alongside my allies,
the more insufficient I feel.
[Eirika]
Your friends aren't there to outshine you, but to
support you. I should know─I'm one of them.

=== Eirika & Jade ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
E-excuse me, Jade? Are you busy? You look as
if you're deep in thought...
[Jade]
Oh. Pardon me, Eirika. I'm not busy. I have no
pressing tasks, so I was letting my mind wander.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
Sometimes people laugh at me...even when I'm
trying to be serious. Do you know why, Jade?
[Jade]
Heh, don't take it too hard. I write for days and
weeks to get a laugh. You're more efficient.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
I wish I could make people laugh in the way that
you do, Jade...
[Jade]
You do? Why is that?
[Eirika]
Should a battle turn dire, that gift could help to
hearten our allies. I fear such a day approaches.
[Jade]
You're earnest and kind, Eirika. Your presence
alone is all the comfort we'll need.

=== Eirika & Jean ===

--- C ---




[Jean]
Emblems can't get hurt or sick, can they? If you
never need a doctor, I'm not much use to you.
[Eirika]
You raise a good point. Our relationship does
seem a bit lopsided...

--- B ---




[Jean]
Emblems are all mind, right? So psychologically,
you might have the same problems people do.
[Eirika]
Hmm. I suppose I am something of a worrier.
I'll take your advice and keep an eye on that.

--- A ---




[Jean]
People's hearts are like teacups. Remnants can
collect over time and pool at the bottom.
[Eirika]
Is that so? What happens if it overflows?
[Jean]
It could become a real problem. You should talk
it out with a professional before that happens.
[Eirika]
Hmm. My heart does feel lighter when we talk,
so there is a way you can treat me after all.

=== Eirika & Kagetsu ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
How do you find being on your own in a foreign
land, Kagetsu? I sometimes get homesick.
[Kagetsu]
Sickness for home? I do not know this feeling.
For me, it is all adventure and learning.

--- B ---




[Kagetsu]
Your sickness for home─it can be cured only
by finding joy in this world. Come with me!
[Eirika]
I suppose that makes sense, but─ Hey! Where
are we going?

--- A ---




[Kagetsu]
Did you enjoy going out with me, Lady Eirika?
I showed you all of my favorite places.
[Eirika]
Yes, although I'd have liked to spend more time
with each. You set quite a brisk pace...
[Kagetsu]
I am very sorry, but there is too much wonder
in this world. You must go quickly to see it all.
[Eirika]
You're right. And after that tour, I feel I know
this place as well as my own home. Thank you.

=== Eirika & Lapis ===

--- C ---




[Lapis]
Have you settled into our world OK, Eirika?
If you need anything, just say the word.
[Eirika]
Anything? Hmm... I can't hold physical objects,
but something fun to look at might be nice.

--- B ---




[Lapis]
I just finished crafting something you might like
to see, Eirika! It's a tiny model furniture set.
[Eirika]
Amazing! These look so delicate and precious.
Thank you, Lapis. I admire your craftiness.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
You're so skilled at crafting with your hands,
Lapis. I must admit, I envy your ability.
[Lapis]
Thanks, but I had to learn. It's mostly a survival
skill. I doubt you'd ever have a use for it.
[Eirika]
Oh, but you're wrong! You craft treasures that
can't be bought, made with love and care.
[Lapis]
Huh. I never thought of it that way... I'd better
be careful. You're gonna give me a big head!

=== Eirika & Lindon ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
You retired from the military once, didn't you?
Aren't you hesitant to risk your life again?
[Lindon]
There's always that risk, but if I can contribute
somehow, I'm happy to do whatever I can.

--- B ---





[Lindon]
Haha! Look, Eirika! I made some pop beans
with Elthunder! Turned out pretty well, huh?
[Eirika]
Wow, you didn't burn a single bean. I've never
seen such fine control over one's magic.

--- A ---





[Lindon]
I believed that I'd see the end of this war, but
I may have been mistaken.
[Eirika]
Don't abandon hope yet. I believe that an age
of peace is due.
[Lindon]
That's very well for someone who can't grow
old to say. The question is, will I live to see it?
[Eirika]
Peace will come sooner than you think. That's
what I'm here to ensure.

=== Eirika & Louis ===

--- C ---




[Louis]
Is it true that Emblems cannot touch anyone in
this world? Does that not get lonely?
[Eirika]
It's not so bad. We can perceive kindness, so
I still feel connected to everyone here.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
I long for my hometown sometimes. And I miss
allies from the long war, especially my friend.
[Louis]
What sort of person was this friend? Wait, don't
tell me. I picture...a beautiful pegasus knight.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
Your guess before was surprisingly accurate.
My friend was a princess and a pegasus knight.
[Louis]
A winning combination to be sure. I'd like to
hear more about her, if you wouldn't mind.
[Louis]
Discussing her with someone else might help to
alleviate your loneliness. Tell me every detail!
[Eirika]
There's some sense in that suggestion, but your
enthusiasm is a bit...off-putting.

=== Eirika & Alear ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
Of all the rings stolen from Lythos, I'm the last
to join you. Please excuse my lateness.
[Alear]
It's not your fault. I'm just glad you're back.
And I promise not to lose you again, Eirika.

--- B ---





[Alear]
I can feel two presences in your ring, Eirika.
Is there more than one Emblem in there?
[Eirika]
My twin brother Ephraim and I are one Emblem.
Only at our power's peak can we exist at once.

--- A ---





[Alear]
It's been good to fight at your side, Eirika.
Is there a way I can thank Ephraim too?
[Eirika]
He won't appear in peacetime. If it's the ring or
his personality, I don't know. But I will tell him.
[Alear]
Thank you. Your support has meant so much to
me─and that goes for both of you.
[Eirika]
I'm also quite pleased with our experiences thus
far. I hope we can always work together.

=== Eirika & Mauvier ===

--- C ---




[Mauvier]
It is strange to fight beside you. I am sorry for
what transpired when we retrieved your ring.
[Eirika]
Please don't apologize. I forgave you long ago.
We're friends now, Mauvier.

--- B ---




[Mauvier]
Who is the warrior who aids you in battle?
He looks and fights the same as you.
[Eirika]
That's my twin brother. He tells me he's
impressed by your fighting skill.

--- A ---




[Mauvier]
Lady Eirika, is there someplace you might wish
to visit? I will take you anywhere you desire.
[Eirika]
I'm happy for your offer, but where is this
coming from?
[Mauvier]
You say you have forgiven me. Yet I still feel the
need to atone. Does that trouble you?
[Eirika]
No. You are a kind soul. Thank you. I'll talk to
my brother and we'll make a decision.

=== Eirika & Merrin ===

--- C ---




[Merrin]
I absolutely adore unusual critters. Tell me, are
there any rare creatures in your world?
[Eirika]
Do monsters count? We have bonewalkers,
entombed, revenants...and man-eating spiders.

--- B ---




[Merrin]
Some animals manage to survive in very harsh
conditions, you know. I respect them for that.
[Eirika]
I ran into a nest of monsters living in a volcanic
zone once. I can't say respect was on my mind.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
I must admit, spending time with you has
helped me better appreciate the unknown.
[Eirika]
I now see how charming strange creatures can
be. You've given me a whole new perspective.
[Merrin]
I'm honored, Lady Eirika. It pleases me that
a princess like you would value my thoughts.
[Merrin]
I hope we can talk more. I want to learn all
about the entombed and bonewalker monsters!

=== Eirika & Timerra ===

--- C ---





[Timerra]
As a princess, don't you love hanging out with
castle guards and napping in the royal garden?
[Eirika]
I-I would never do something so brash. Where
I'm from, it would be seen as quite untoward.

--- B ---





[Timerra]
I love traveling to places incognito, ya know?
Have you ever done that?
[Eirika]
Well, I have traveled within my country. Not for
amusement, sadly...always because of war.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
The way you live... I've been thinking royals
should perhaps allow themselves more freedom.
[Timerra]
For sure! If the people ruling a country aren't
free, how can they build a country that is?
[Eirika]
That is a good point. Still, I can't help but think
a country must be guided by a solid set of rules.
[Timerra]
I get it, I really do. The more I hang with you,
the more I see that rules can come in handy.

=== Eirika & Pandreo ===

--- C ---





[Pandreo]
Lady Eirika, how about I give you a lesson in
living it up? Or...are parties not your thing?
[Eirika]
I do enjoy having fun. Though, how to put this?
I─ I do not know how to act at parties.

--- B ---





[Pandreo]
There's no such thing as party etiquette. I say,
the louder you shout, the more fun you have!
[Eirika]
Shout? I've never done that outside a battle.
But...yes. I will give it a try!

--- A ---





[Eirika]
So, about the shouting... I decided to give it a
try by myself. And I found it quite refreshing!
[Pandreo]
I mean, that's not really the point. You gotta
shout with other people around, not all alone.
[Eirika]
I see. But, Pandreo, I confess I feel embarrassed
at the thought of other people hearing me.
[Pandreo]
How about you and I give it a test run, then?
Just the two of us, shouting until it feels right.

=== Eirika & Panette ===

--- C ---





[Panette]
You speak in such a noble manner, Eirika.
Refined language is a must for royalty, is it not?
[Eirika]
I've never given it much thought. It is simply the
manner of speaking I am most at ease with.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
Panette, I couldn't help notice your refined way
of speaking. It is lovely...and also quite adorable.
[Panette]
I studied elocution so as to sound cultured. I've
not been told I might sound adorable as well.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
Speaking properly is not what matters. Speaking
from the heart and with respect─that matters.
[Panette]
Speaking from the heart is...troublesome for me.
I wonder, can you discern my true feelings?
[Eirika]
Yes, I think so. I can tell that you are pleased we
have this opportunity to fight beside each other.
[Panette]
Yes, that is correct. I am happy. Oh, it makes
me blush to find you can read me so easily!

=== Eirika & Rosado ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
You can draw anything you see, can't you?
What an incredible gift.
[Rosado]
Hehe, not as incredible as your adorable face.
Actually, let me capture that real quick.

--- B ---





[Rosado]
Here are some landscapes I drew recently,
Eirika. Which one's your favorite?
[Eirika]
Oh, I could never choose─they're all so lovely.
Looking at them makes me homesick, though...

--- A ---





[Rosado]
Your memories of home must be pretty strong
to distract you from all my beautiful drawings.
[Eirika]
I'm sorry. I did say they were lovely, and
I meant it. You're very talented.
[Eirika]
It was because they were so powerful that I was
reminded of the beautiful scenery back home.
[Rosado]
I'd love to hear about your world sometime.
It sounds like an interesting place to live.

=== Eirika & Saphir ===

--- C ---





[Saphir]
Tell me something, Eirika. If Emblems can't
eat, where do you get the energy to fight?
[Eirika]
I have no idea. All I know is that a lack of food
doesn't hinder me.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
You have a powerful physique, Saphir. You must
train hard to maintain those muscles.
[Saphir]
Hahaha! Sure, but it was really a daily routine of
hunting and fishing that built this body up.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
It's interesting to hear you talk of hunting and
fishing. I never realized they were so intensive.
[Saphir]
Why not? Those animals and fish are fighting
to survive. Not much different from war.
[Eirika]
I lived a sheltered life for the most part. I never
got to have those kinds of experiences.
[Saphir]
Didn't you take on some kinda Demon King?
That's way more exciting. Tell me about that!

=== Eirika & Seadall ===

--- C ---





[Seadall]
Your long, flowing hair is perfect for dancing.
Would you dance with me outside of battle?
[Eirika]
Thank you, but I am not skilled at dancing.
Though, perhaps you would teach me?

--- B ---





[Seadall]
Your hair is truly beautiful, Eirika. I wish mine
shimmered in the light like yours.
[Eirika]
Oh, your hair is quite beautiful too. Though with
it being so long, it must be difficult to tame.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
Your hair─no, your entire bearing─it is simply
magnificent. You are a true master of your art.
[Seadall]
That's very kind. I do everything in my power to
make sure my dance is breathtaking to behold.
[Seadall]
So, it's good to have someone like you around.
You inspire me to continue working my hardest.
[Eirika]
I'm glad to hear it, Seadall. Seeing you dance
on the battlefield brings me so much joy.

=== Eirika & Alcryst ===

--- C ---





[Alcryst]
I'm sorry you got stuck with me, Lady Eirika.
My brother is far superior. Compared to him, I...
[Eirika]
I feel the same way about my own brother.
I often fret that he should be here in my stead...

--- B ---





[Alcryst]
You have an amazing older brother like me, so
you must know how sibling inferiority feels...
[Eirika]
I do, but Ephraim speaks honest praise for me
often. I know your brother must do the same.

--- A ---





[Alcryst]
My brother is always supportive of me, but he's
just being kind. I'm sure he... Secretly, he...
[Eirika]
Perhaps this is just me, but if he truly felt
otherwise, would he really be so considerate?
[Eirika]
Everyone still has something to learn and room
to grow. Our brothers see our true potential.
[Alcryst]
I suppose you're right. I worry that I won't live
up to that potential...but I'll try my best like you.

=== Eirika & Amber ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
My world didn't have any of those "alpacas" you
love, Amber. They're so unusual and adorable!
[Amber]
Adorable? Yes! Unusual? I don't know about
that one. They're a perfect pet for any home!

--- B ---





[Amber]
I've come a long way─from alpaca ranch hand
to royal retainer. Do you have retainers, Eirika?
[Eirika]
I did, once. He was a brave, benevolent knight
named Seth. Many called him the Silver Knight.

--- A ---





[Amber]
Your retainer was called the Silver Knight...and
I'm just an alpaca-wrangling master...
[Eirika]
Is something the matter, Amber? You look as if
you're in pain...
[Amber]
I'm a royal retainer, but I don't have a cool title!
What can I do to earn a knightly nickname?
[Eirika]
There's just one thing you should do: your best.
Legends and nicknames will follow. I promise!

=== Eirika & Vander ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
I was told you were skilled at knitting, yet I'd
not seen you practice the art. How wonderful!
[Vander]
It's rare I'm praised so genuinely. People are
often more surprised than anything.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
When you fight, Vander, what drives you?
Why do you risk your life in combat?
[Vander]
That is quite simple─to protect those I love.
My life is entirely in service to that idea.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
I want to protect others, the same as you.
[Vander]
I may well lack your noble heritage, but I share
your convictions.
[Vander]
That a princess and an old knight might each
risk all in service of that belief... It is surprising.
[Eirika]
Not at all. We are the same in that we both try
to protect those who can't protect themselves.

=== Eirika & Veyle ===

--- C ---





[Veyle]
As an Emblem visiting this world, what do you
think of Divine Dragons and Fell Dragons?
[Eirika]
I understand that one is thought to be holy and
the other evil. But perhaps there is more to it?

--- B ---





[Eirika]
Do you ever get tired of fighting, Veyle?
I...sometimes wonder if anyone ever truly wins.
[Veyle]
I used to feel that way. But I've put my trust
in someone, and I will follow where they lead.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
I'm sorry if I sounded discouraging before.
I did not mean to deter you from fighting.
[Veyle]
Oh, but I'm glad you told me how you felt.
It's helpful to hear other opinions.
[Veyle]
More than that, I think you spoke out of
kindness. And I love your kind heart.
[Eirika]
Thank you for trying to comfort me. Know that
I will always support you with all of my power.

=== Eirika & Yunaka ===

--- C ---




[Yunaka]
Well, look at you! Sleek as a sword, sharp as a
razor─those cheekbones could cut glass!
[Eirika]
I'll take that as a compliment? Thank you.

--- B ---





[Eirika]
You seem to have boundless energy, Yunaka.
I can't help but enjoy myself around you.
[Yunaka]
Zappy! But if I get my energy from having fun
with you, how do we know who started it?!

--- A ---




[Yunaka]
You're such a genuine and charismatic person,
Eirika. Must be how you were raised.
[Eirika]
I'm flattered, but I'm sure I could say the same
about you.
[Yunaka]
Nah, not really, even if it's nice to hear you say
so. Not many people are as honest as you.
[Eirika]
I understand. And people like you are an equally
rare find, Yunaka.

=== Eirika & Zelkov ===

--- C ---





[Eirika]
I'm impressed by your broad range of interests.
I don't have any hobbies at all.
[Zelkov]
My pursuits *provide* me with a sense of
purpose. They are my greatest source of joy.

--- B ---





[Zelkov]
Anyone can take up a pursuit. You need only
*select* something and begin.
[Eirika]
Good idea. I'll give that some thought.

--- A ---





[Eirika]
I've decided on a pursuit, Zelkov. I want to bring
peace to the people of this world.
[Zelkov]
That seems less of a *pursuit* to me and more
of a responsibility.
[Eirika]
I'm not doing it because I have to. I'm doing it
because I want to see people living happily.
[Zelkov]
I fail to see the distinction, but it is a *worthy*
answer nevertheless.
