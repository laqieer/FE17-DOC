[Ivy] 
Hortensia.
[Hortensia] 
Something on your mind, Ivy? Or are you 
just here to admire my pretty face?
[Ivy] 
Hmm. I'm just happy.
[Ivy] 
We've been through so much, but we're finally 
together again.
[Ivy] 
You're my only family now. I want you to know 
that you are important to me.
[Hortensia] 
Guess it's a relief to hear a half-sister counts 
as family.
[Ivy] 
That has never mattered to me. I have always 
thought of you as my sister.
[Ivy] 
And you are all the family I need.
[Hortensia] 
Yeah, well... No need to make it awkward.
[Hortensia] 
But I feel the same way, so... Thanks.
[Ivy] 
Hmm. You have your mother's smile.
[Ivy] 
In fact, you seem to resemble her more and 
more each day.
[Hortensia] 
You think so?
[Hortensia] 
I'm flattered... I'm really glad.
[Hortensia] 
It's only thanks to her I get to call you my sister 
in the first place.
[Ivy] 
...
[Hortensia] 
Ah, I don't mean to dig all that up. I'm not 
holding a grudge or anything.
[Ivy] 
I know...
[Ivy] 
Even so, it is because of my mother that you─
[Hortensia] 
Oh, y'know what? I just remembered something 
I gotta do...somewhere. Sorry, Ivy! Talk later!
[Hortensia] 

[Ivy] 
I'm sorry, Hortensia...

[Hortensia] 
Ivy... Do you remember much about my mother?
[Ivy] 
Of course. She was quite memorable.
[Hortensia] 
Maybe you could tell me a little about her...
[Hortensia] 
What do you remember most?
[Ivy] 
...
[Ivy] 
My clearest memory is her smile.
[Ivy] 
My mother hated all of Father's...other women. 
Your mother especially.
[Ivy] 
So she was badly mistreated by my mother 
and by all who sought her favor.
[Ivy] 
Yet even through all of that, she never seemed 
to stop smiling.
[Hortensia] 
Yeah...
[Ivy] 
By her charm and wits, she eventually won even 
my mother over.
[Ivy] 
She turned her biggest enemy into a friend 
through sheer determination.
[Ivy] 
It left a powerful impression on me.
[Ivy] 
It made me realize how strong a parent can be 
for a child.
[Hortensia] 
How strong?
[Ivy] 
Yes.
[Ivy] 
It seems to me your mother fought those battles 
to carve out a niche for you.
[Hortensia] 
For me?
[Ivy] 
Yes. She was the sort of person who shone 
a light on everyone who knew her.
[Ivy] 
And you were the reason she shined so bright.
[Hortensia] 
...
[Hortensia] 
This was something I needed to hear.
[Hortensia] 
Thank you, Ivy.

[Hortensia] 
Hey, Ivy?
[Ivy] 
Yes?
[Hortensia] 
Do you think...I could be like my mother 
someday?
[Hortensia] 
I mean, obviously I've got her looks already. 
But I'm not sure I have her other qualities.
[Ivy] 
You know, Hortensia...
[Ivy] 
I think you do.
[Ivy] 
You lost her when you were seven, correct?
[Hortensia] 
Yes.
[Ivy] 
But you kept living in the castle, even without 
the benefit of her protection.
[Ivy] 
You know what a viper's den of intrigue that 
place is. No ordinary child could survive it.
[Ivy] 
But your charisma made that possible.
[Hortensia] 
What are you getting at?
[Ivy] 
Your wit and charm won you allies in the court 
and a safe place in the castle. Sound familiar?
[Ivy] 
You thrived in the academy as well─you even 
skipped enough grades to catch up to me.
[Ivy] 
All that was done by virtue of your own merit.
[Ivy] 
Do you see it yet?
[Ivy] 
You said you hoped you could become like 
your mother someday.
[Ivy] 
But you already are. Your light shines on 
everyone you touch, just as hers did.
[Hortensia] 
...
[Hortensia] 
I...I can't believe that's how you see me.
[Hortensia] 
Thank you.
[Ivy] 
I should be thanking you.
[Ivy] 
Your example has given me courage more times 
than I can count.
[Ivy] 
Thank you for shining your light on 
me, Hortensia.
[Hortensia] 
Aww...
[Hortensia] 
I'm gonna do all I can to live up to the image 
you have of me.
[Hortensia] 
It was so hard not to just despair and give up 
when we were separated.
[Hortensia] 
Father was gone. You were gone... I had no one.
[Ivy] 
I'm truly sorry, Hortensia. From now on, we'll 
be together.
[Hortensia] 
That better be a promise...because you're not 
getting rid of me.
[Ivy] 
Absolutely. We will never be separated again. 
I promise.
[Ivy] 
I am blessed to have family like you, Hortensia. 
I will never willingly let that go.
[Hortensia] 
Good. Me neither.
