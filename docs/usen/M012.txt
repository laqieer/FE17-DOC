=== Chapter 12 The Sentinels ===

(Tullah Desert)
Their rings lost to Veyle, the party
heads to the Queendom of Solm to
regain their footing.

--- OP ---




[Alear]
So, this is Solm. It's very...sandy.
[Ivy]
The queendom's land is covered in deserts.
I believe this one is called Tullah.
And as you've no doubt noticed, it's much
hotter than in Elusia. I fear I may melt.
[Diamant]
What now, Divine One?
[Alear]
We'd better head straight to the palace. I just
hope the Hounds haven't gotten there first.
[Ivy]
During my time in Elusia, the Four Hounds did
pay a few visits to Solm.
But they came back empty-handed each time,
so I expect the palace is unharmed.
[Alfred]
Thanks, Ivy. Pretty handy, having an enemy as
a friend.
[Ivy]
I will choose to take that as a compliment.
[Alear]
Which Emblem Ring was entrusted to Solm?
[Ivy]
The Radiant Hero─said to be among the
most powerful.
Needless to say, it would be quite a boon.
[Alear]
Sounds like exactly what we need right now.
Let's get going.

[Fogado]
Hey, you don't look like you're from around here.
What's with the outfits?
[Alear]
Uh...
[Fogado]
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. But I took one look
and thought to myself, "Self, they are lost."
[Alear]
And, uh, who are you?
[Fogado]
Who am I? I'm the guy. Here to keep the peace
in Tullah Desert. Call me Fogado, yeah?
$
[Fogado]
As captain of the Sentinels, it's my duty to help people
in need. You fine folks need a hand, just lemme know.
[Alear]
Thanks for that. As for myself, I'm the Divine Dragon
. From Lythos.
[Fogado]
Wait, you're who?! You're telling me the Divine Dragon
is here, in my desert? No kidding?
[Alear]
Yes.
[Fogado]
Aah... I had no idea! I'm so sorry─I didn't mean
to be rude.
[Alear]
You weren't. There's no need to be formal with me.
[Fogado]
Didn't expect you to be casual. That's cool.
[Fogado]
But hey. What brings you all out to my piece
of the world?
[Alear]
We're on our way to Solm Palace...but we don't know
how to get there.
[Fogado]
This is your lucky day. C'mon, just follow me. If I know
how to get anywhere, it's the palace.
[Alear]
You don't mind?
[Fogado]
Of course I don't! You know what's out there? Sand as far as the
eye can see. And I would rather you not have to deal with that.
[Fogado]
Lucky we met, huh? Haha!




[Alear]
Let's see. Which way to the palace again?
[Ivy]
Divine One...I believe we passed that enormous
rock earlier.
[Alear]
What, really? Ugh... All this terrain looks
the same to me.
[Ivy]
I wish I could help. My knowledge of Solmic
geography comes only from maps.
Wait a moment. Prince Alfred, Prince Diamant...
Your nations are allied with Solm. Haven't you
gone to the palace before?
[Diamant]
I did, but...quite a long time ago. I don't
remember the way.
[Alfred]
I traveled from Firene. I've got no clue how to
get there from Elusia.
[Ivy]
So none of us knows where to go.
...Ah.
All right, I'll say it. We're lost.
[Alear]
I'm afraid so.
We can't afford to waste time. I wonder if
there's a landmark to go by...



[Alear]
Thank you, Fogado. We appreciate your help.


[Fogado]
Don't sweat it. Oh, you know what? I do have
a quick errand to take care of first.
[Alear]
An errand? What kind of errand?
[Fogado]
More of a mission. See, not too long ago, these
freaky creatures started appearing everywhere.
As captain of the Sentinels, when I get a report
about a problem in the desert, I take care of it.
Sorry about this. You have a sit, and I'll take
you to the palace right after I'm done.
[Alear]
Actually, why don't we come with you?
We can help.
[Fogado]
That'd be great! My friends went ahead of me─
let's go meet up with them.


[Fogado]
The problem's even worse than I expected.
Hey, there they are! Pandreo! Bunet!



[Pandreo]
Fogado? You're late! I was starting to think you
wanted us to die out here.
[Bunet]
With any further delay, these creatures would
have made a meal of us.
[Fogado]
Sorry about that, fellas. But hey, I brought help!
[Pandreo]
Help? What do you mean, help?
[Fogado]
Oh, Pandreo, my pious friend. This is really
gonna blow your mind.


[Alear]
Hello. I'm the Divine Dragon .
Nice to meet you.
[Pandreo]
Oh, it's the Divine Dragon.
THE DIVINE DRAGON?!
Hang on... What were you thinking, bringing the
Divine Dragon here?!
[Bunet]
That hair... Like two scoops of sorbet, swirling
together in the desert heat...
[Pandreo]
Hey, save it for the kitchen! That's a deity
you're talking about!
[Fogado]
I knew this would get you two fired up. Divine
One, these are my Sentinel friends.
What do you say─ready to handle a mission
with us?
[Alear]
Ready.


--- ED ---




[Fogado]
Nice going! You really showed 'em what the
Divine Dragon can do.
Now, to Solm Palace! Stay close─I'd hate for
you to split off and get lost. Again.
[Alear]
Thanks, Fogado.
[Fogado]

[Alfred]
This ought to be interesting. It's been years
since I visited the palace.
[Alear]
Years? I thought Solm and Firene had a
good relationship.
[Alfred]
Our countries are allies, sure, but that doesn't
mean our families are close-knit.
In fact, out of Solm's whole royal family, my
mother and I have only met Queen Seforia.
[Alear]
What? No one else?
[Alfred]
Nope. Not the royal consort, not the crown
princess, and not her brother, the prince.
[Alear]
That's strange.
[Diamant]
I never met them either.
[Alfred]
Same thing happened to you, huh?
[Diamant]
I may have forgotten the way to the palace,
but I remember well what happened there.
It was a strange scene. The queen received us
alone, with no one attending her.
When we asked to meet the princess and prince,
she told us they weren't there.
[Alfred]
She told us the exact same thing! I asked when
they'd be back and she said, "No idea."
It didn't make sense. If you're royalty, you can't
leave your castle whenever you like.
I got the feeling she was hiding them from us...
But why? Were they sick? Or shy?
[Alear]
Shy... That would surprise me.
Everyone we've met here has been so friendly.
[Alfred]
The queen is too. There are just some things
about the royal family that don't add up.
Let's be on guard, all right?
[Alear]
Got it.




[Fogado]
We're here! Solm Palace. Now all that's left is
asking those guards to open the gate.
[Alear]
Thanks for leading the way, Fogado. I don't
know how we'd have gotten here without you.
[Fogado]
Of course. Just another day in the life of
a Sentinel.
[Alear]
I'll be sure to commend you to the queen.
Anyway, now we'd better be on our way...
[Fogado]
Huh? Uh, Fogado, what are you doing?
[Alear]



[Fogado]
Talking to the guards! What else?
[Fogado]

[Diamant]
Does he have a meeting with the queen as well?
[Alfred]
Beats me. Maybe he's here on some kind of
Sentinel business.
[Diamant]


[Alear]
Fogado, wait for us.
[Alfred]

[Alear]



[Fogado]
Hey! I'm home!
[Fogado]


[Alear]
Home?
[Alear]

Welcome back, Prince Fogado.
ソルム兵士 ソードナイト3
I'll open the gate.
[Fogado]
Yes, let the gate...be open!
[Fogado]

[Ivy]
"Prince"? Did that guard say, "prince"?
[Alfred]
Unless we misheard him...in exactly the
same way...


[Fogado]
Thanks for waiting, folks.
[Ivy]


[Alear]
Fogado, we're a little confused... Are you
the prince of Solm?
[Fogado]
Did I not mention that?
[Alfred]
[Diamant]
Ah, no, you didn't.
[Fogado]
Whoops! Egg, meet face. Right, let me do
this properly.
I'm Fogado, captain of the Sentinels, and the
prince of Solm. Welcome to my family's palace.
Come on in! You wanted to meet Mom, right?
Mom! Visitors!
[Fogado]

[Alear]
What is happening?


[Ivy]
I didn't realize he was royalty.
[Alfred]
A prince personally going on patrols... Not
something you see every day.
[Diamant]
I wonder why we never met him before. He
doesn't seem sick. He's certainly not shy.
[Alear]
It's a mystery. Anyway, let's head in.
Don't want to keep Prince Fogado waiting.

Hehehe...
Stolen. Miserable. Torn apart from your friends.
How delicious.
[Marth]

[Zephia]
Lady Veyle.
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
Zephia, tell me. What are the Divine Dragon's
forces up to?
[Zephia]
They passed through the Shadowy Moor.
It appears they've arrived in Solm.
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
So they did not return to Brodia─they're
gathering more rings. Good.
[Zephia]

[Marni]
Can we go after them, Lady Veyle? I'm itching
for a rematch!
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
Patience, Marni.
If we wait, we can steal Solm's ring from them
along with the others.
[Marni]
Smart! I'll be a good girl and wait, then.
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
You are a treasure, Marni.
[Zephia]
Isn't she just? The pride of the Four Hounds.
[Marni]
Hehe, you two really heap on the praise.
That's why I love ya!
[Griss]
Heh... You're such a child.
Praise is for chumps. It's much more fun to
be punished.
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
Worry not, Griss. You will soon have all the
agony your heart could want.
[Griss]
That's what I like to hear! The perks of the gig
right there.
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
And you, Mauvier? How would you like to
be rewarded?
[Griss]
[Marni]

[Mauvier]
Nothing for me, my lady.
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
You won't even say my name. How cold.
[Mauvier]

[Mauvier]
[Zephia]
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
That's all right. For now we wait, we watch,
and then, when the time comes...
Ngh...

[Zephia]
Lady Veyle?
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
I've been awake for too long.
I must sleep. Here are your instructions. Zephia,
take charge.

Relax

[Fogado]
All right. Let's do this thing, Sentinels.
And, uh, guests.

[Pandreo]
Finally, time to get this party started! AR-ROO!
[Pandreo]

[Bunet]
I will serve up a most deadly dish.
[Bunet]


[Fogado]
Before I forget, watch out for those patches of
quicksand. That stuff will really slow you down.


[Pandreo]
Divine One, it's such an honor! Please, use my
abilities as you see fit.
I can use my staff to warp you or an ally
somewhere far away on the battlefield.
