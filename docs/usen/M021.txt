(Lythos Castle)
Having learned a harsh truth from 
Griss, the party pursues the Fell 
Dragon to Lythos Castle.

[Mauvier] 
Our ship is docked here.
[Alear] 
Thank you for escorting us.
[Marni] 1 
[Marni] 
Mauvier! All ready, like you asked! Feel free to 
tell me how great I am! Wait a minute.
What's the Divine Dragon doing here?!
[Alear] 
Marni?
[Marni] 
What do you want?! We don't have any 
more rings!
[Mauvier] 
There are circumstances that require we travel 
together to Lythos.
[Marni] 
Huh?!
[Mauvier] 
Divine Dragon. After Marni and I lost the rings, 
Zephia disciplined us...to an unjust extreme.
So, on my honor, I will not betray you once 
at sea. I will deliver you safely to Lythos.
Will you trust me?
[Alear] 
I will. Take us to Lythos.
[Marni] 
What?! Why would you help them?! They're 
not our friends. They're enemies!
[Mauvier] 
The Divine Dragon should meet with 
Lady Veyle.
[Alear] 
We have no reason to fight. As long as you 
don't start trouble.
[Marni] 
I know a threat about not threatening people 
when I hear one. Mauvier! What's happening?!
[Mauvier] 
You will hear details once we're aboard. If that 
is unsatisfactory, then you may remain here.
[Marni] 
Hey! What?! Fine! Fine. OK?
Temporary truce until I get back to Zephia 
and the others in Lythos.
[Mauvier] 
So be it. Let us go, Divine Dragon.
[Alear] 
OK.

[Alear] 2 
[Mauvier] 1 
[Marni] 3 
[Marni] 
You're Lord Sombron's child?! What?!
[Alear] 
Yes.
[Marni] 
So that means...you're the sibling Lady Veyle 
has been looking for all along?!
And that's why we're headed to Lythos... 
Hang on. Does Griss know about this?
[Alear] 
He's the one who told me.
[Mauvier] 
Griss picked a fight at Elusia Castle to verify the 
truth, even surrendering a ring to do so.
[Marni] 
What?! Nobody told me that was the plan!
[Alear] 
Why are Sombron and Veyle going to Lythos?
[Mauvier] 
It's about Gradlon, the Fell Dragon's land lost 
under the sea. He intends to restore it.
[Vander] 4 

[Vander] 
To restore that unholy land?! My word.
[Alear] 
What more do you know about this, Vander?
[Vander] 
Gradlon sank beneath the waves one thousand 
years ago.
It was, of course, Sombron's land.
Gradlon was a wicked place─one as much 
as Lythos is holy.
[Vander] 
[Mauvier] 
To raise and revive it, Sombron needs to 
destroy the Divine Dragon Shard in Lythos.
That shard is what chains Gradlon beneath the 
waves. Lord Sombron finds it...problematic.
[Alear] 
So, you're saying that Sombron's greatest 
desire...is to restore Gradlon?
[Mauvier] 
Far from it. His desire─if such a word is fitting 
for Lord Sombron─is to invade other worlds.
[Alear] 
Other worlds?!
[Mauvier] 
The continent of Elyos is only a stepping-stone. 
He plans to extend himself─everywhere.
[Alear] 
There are other worlds, and he wants to rule 
them all. How is that even possible?
[Mauvier] 
I'm well beyond what I know for certain. Lord 
Sombron has shared little of this with me.
I can say Lady Veyle is a pawn in service of 
his greater ambitions.
[Alear] 
Please, tell me anything more you know.
I've heard that Veyle's called a defect. What 
does that even mean?
[Mauvier] 
Well, as a start, dragon royalty should be able to 
summon Emblems. She cannot.
Lord Sombron learned this recently, soon after 
his revival, when reunited with Lady Veyle.
His children all fought in the war. But she, his 
youngest, never saw battle─or any Emblems.
[Alear] 
She told me we met once, all that time ago.
[Mauvier] 
You were among her many siblings. They all, 
in time, died fighting in the war.
All...save for you.
[Alear] 
...
[Mauvier] 
Then Sombron was imprisoned and Lady 
Veyle's mother died, leaving her alone.
She could find no friends in an age when it was 
rumored a last Fell Dragon child had survived.
Lady Veyle lived in hiding, knowing that─were 
she discovered─she would be killed.
[Alear] 
A thousand years, living like that... All alone 
that whole time?
[Mauvier] 
Not exactly. A few centuries ago, she came into 
contact with worshippers of the Fell Dragon...
In their care, she slept in a hidden temple─until 
Lord Sombron's release.
She had been, long ago, close with those in 
that temple. But when she recently awoke...
[Alear] 
They were all dead, weren't they...
[Mauvier] 
So, Lady Veyle was relieved, even overjoyed, 
to find herself reunited with Lord Sombron.
He detested her and proclaimed her a defect 
lacking a Fell Dragon's abilities and character.
Sombron required her obedience, however, so 
he ordered Zephia to tamper with her nature.
Lady Veyle may have thought she was no longer 
alone, but she's never been more so...ever.
[Alear] 
How awful...
[Marni] 
...
[Mauvier] 
What is it, Marni? Is it the waves? Are 
you seasick?
[Marni] 
No! I'm trying not to cry! But...I never knew 
Lady Veyle's life was so sad.
I thought I was the one with the tragic story. 
I should've maybe been nicer to her, probably.
[Mauvier] 
You have never told me of your past, Marni.
[Marni] 
I mean, you know, happens all the time... I was 
just abandoned by my mom, that's all.
I had a lot─a lot─of brothers, and she decided 
she didn't need a girl.
Which is weird since I was way superior to 
those useless jerks, even back then...
I mean, I was better at helping her, but she 
never said thank you or good job...or anything.
The first time we went for a walk, just us, was 
so she could find somewhere to dump me.
Imagine, my hand in hers, and we're strolling 
from place to place. She left me at a church.
[Alear] 
I can't believe it...
[Marni] 
It's fine! The priest was nice. Long as I helped 
free Lord Sombron, I got lots of thank-yous.
Eventually, I met Zephia and joined the Hounds. 
See? Lady Veyle's story is so much sadder.
[Mauvier] 
Zephia filled out the Four Hounds with devout 
followers of the Fell Dragon.
[Alear] 
Did that include you, Mauvier?
[Mauvier] 
Yes. I was there at the hidden temple where 
Lady Veyle slept. When she awoke...
I was there to speak with her. She, a royal 
dragon, asked me to be her friend.
I said it was impossible. Lady Veyle then asked 
if I could offer my service to her as a knight.
[Alear] 
And you accepted.
[Mauvier] 
That I could not refuse.
[Marni] 
It's a big deal to be hand-picked like that, 
by royalty. Who woulda thought!
You, made her knight? That's just cool. I mean 
that, Mauvier. That's really cool.
[Mauvier] 
Should you wish, I am sure Lady Veyle would 
also accept you as her knight.
[Marni] 
What? No way. I don't wanna work with you 
that much. No praise, no thank-yous. I hate you.
[Mauvier] 
Is that so?
[Marni] 
Besides, I already belong somewhere. I need to 
get back to Zephia.
Since you're helping the Divine Dragon, you're 
probably gonna get kicked out of the Hounds.
[Mauvier] 
I expect as much.
[Marni] 
Yeah, well, I like being one of the Four Hounds. 
As soon as we're off this boat, we're enemies.
[Mauvier] 
You do hate me, after all. So surely, you'll 
be happier.
[Marni] 
Right, so... Yes. I'm done talking. This is a 
waste of my time.
[Marni] 

[Alear] 
Mauvier, thank you for telling us all of that.
When we find Veyle, I hope you will do what 
you think is best for her.
Even if that means we'll cross blades again.
[Mauvier] 
I shall.

[Alear] 2 

[Vander] 1 

[Alear] 
What's happened to Lythos? The land─it's 
fallen to rot and ruin.
[Vander] 
A sure sign of Gradlon's return, or that our foes 
are now destroying the Divine Dragon Shard.
[Alear] 
We have to stop Sombron. Where is the shard?
[Vander] 
It's in the castle─Queen Lumera's home.
[Alear] 
Who would have thought we'd return here 
to see everything...come to this.

[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
I know you're here, Sombron! Show yourself!
[Zephia] 1 
[Zephia] 
Ah, the Divine Dragon has arrived.
Or should I call you the "Divine Impostor"?
[Alear] 
...
[Zephia] 
You've arrived earlier than expected. How did 
you know where to find us?
My other two children haven't even caught 
up to us yet...
[Alear] 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Marni] 4 
[Mauvier] 
I assume you mean us.
[Griss] 3 
[Griss] 
Why are you with them?!
[Zephia] 
You two brought them here? And betrayed us? 
Unbelievable.
[Marni] 
Please, no! You have it wrong!
[Griss] 
Wrong?! Tch, looks pretty clear to me.
[Mauvier] 
This is my doing. I want Lady Veyle to meet 
with the Divine Dragon.
I might have even forced them to come. But it 
wasn't necessary. Marni had no part in this.
[Marni] 
Mauvier...
[Mauvier] 
Return to the Hounds, Marni.
[Marni] 
B-but...
[Mauvier] 
Do not hesitate. Go. Now!
[Marni] 
[Zephia] 
Marni, welcome back. But, Mauvier, what will 
we do with you?
I'm willing to forgive and forget, if you can 
explain yourself. We are family, after all.
[Mauvier] 
What nonsense. I know you're going to punish 
me. But Lady Veyle will see the Divine Dragon.
[Zephia] 
You rude, self-serving...
[Griss] 
[Veyle] 3 

[Veyle] 
I don't mind. I was just thinking I'd like to talk 
to the Divine Dragon myself.

[Marni] 
HYAAAH!
...
[Veyle] 
Marni, that was simply pathetic. An attack like that 
couldn't put a scratch on Father's gift.
[Marni] 
I swung with all my strength, and it did nothing?
[Veyle] 
I take it you were trying to free me, fool that you are. 
But as it turns out, you have failed in your attempt.
[Marni] 
No...
[Zephia] 
I ordered you to stop, did I not?
Such a bad girl.
[Marni] 
I...
[Alear] 4 

[Alear] 
...
[Zephia] 
You are a very naughty child. If only you had 
done as I had said...
[Marni] 
Ze...phi...a...
[Marni] 

[Alear] 
[Mauvier] 4 
[Mauvier] 
Marni!
[Marni] 2 
[Marni] 
Mauvier...
I'm sorry... I tried to save her, but...in the end, 
I guess...I wasn't strong enough.
If she's...ever her old self again...will you tell her 
something for me?
Please tell her that...she's done...so well, huh?
...
[Mauvier] 
Don't go... Please! Marni!
[Marni] 
...
[Marni] 
[Zephia] 
Aw, did she die in your arms? How very tragic...
[Veyle] 

[Griss] 1 
[Griss] 
What a waste. Got killed for nothing.
[Mauvier] 
AAAH!

[Veyle] 黒 悪 1 
[Mauvier] 4 

[Alear] 
Veyle? What's happened to you?
[Veyle] 黒 悪 
Hehehe... It's good to see you again.
[Mauvier] 
What did you do to Lady Veyle?
[Zephia] 3 
[Zephia] 
I told you about Lord Sombron's enchanted 
helmet. My spell has now truly taken hold.
[Alear] 
Veyle, do you know who I am?!
[Veyle] 黒 悪 
Why, you're my dear long-lost brother. 
What a happy reunion.
[Veyle] 黒 悪 
Why, you're my dear long-lost sister. 
What a happy reunion.
[Alear] 
...
[Alear] 
[Mauvier] 
[Marni] 2 
[Marni] 
What the... This is what you've been trying to 
do to her? Can the other Lady Veyle return?
[Zephia] 
No, never. Not as long as that helmet remains 
attached and intact.
That other side of her is dead.
[Marni] 
D-dead?
[Zephia] 
Oh, please. You should be delighted. You don't 
have to talk to the defect anymore.
[Marni] 
Zephia, I know about Veyle's past... Do you? 
You were alive way back then...
[Zephia] 
What?
[Marni] 
I mean, I didn't know...when I helped you with 
all of these awful things.
Lady Veyle was all alone for so long. And she 
was so excited to see her family again.
She never got to enjoy it. And now she 
never will. It's all so terrible...
[Zephia] 
What is this, Marni?
[Marni] 
Zephia, I loved it when you gave me praise.
I loved it when you said we were family. I loved 
belonging somewhere. I loved the Four Hounds.
But this has gone too far.
I have to do what I know is right, praise 
or no praise.
[Zephia] 
Marni?!
[Marni] 
I'm going to free Lady Veyle! I'm going to break 
that helmet to pieces!
[Zephia] 
No! Stop!

[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Marni was just...trying to restore Veyle.
And all this...for that?
[Mauvier] 3 
[Mauvier] 
I will never stand by you again, Zephia. Save for 
the moment my blade pierces your heart!
Divine Dragon, I beg of you! Allow me to fight 
at your side.
To avenge Marni, and to save Lady Veyle.
[Alear] 
Mauvier, of course.
[Griss] 
[Veyle] 黒 悪 1 
[Veyle] 黒 悪 
So, you're just going to betray me? Leave me 
sad and lonely again?
And you, Brother. I thought you'd be happy to 
be reunited with me after...so long.
And you, Sister. I thought you'd be happy to 
be reunited with me after...so long.

[Alear] 
You are not our Veyle.
[Veyle] 黒 悪 
This must be about my new look. Then you're 
not going to like this look either.
[Zephia] 
[Marth] 3 

[Alear] 
Marth.
[Veyle] 黒 悪 
His fellow Emblems, stolen away. You turned 
your back on him. Oh, lonely thing.
Just like me. But I'm here for you, little Emblem. 
I'm all you need.
Now, had I known I had a sibling who survived 
the years...I would have killed you.
I'd like to make sure I'm my Father's one 
and only child.
[Alear] 
You want to be alone forever?
[Veyle] 黒 悪 
Yes, that's right. I have no need for this sort of 
family, or friendships, or bonds of loyalty.
I do appreciate you bringing the rings to me, 
but that's where our relationship ends...
Now, goodbye, Brother.
Now, goodbye, Sister.

[Alear] 
Veyle...

Here. Please, take this.

Why did you do that?! You shouldn't have 
jumped in front of me, !
[Alear] 
I did what I...had to do...to keep you out of 
harm's way.
I wanted to make up for all the times I couldn't 
protect you. All the times I wasn't there for you...
I'm so sorry...Veyle...for all those awful things 
I said.
[Veyle] 
I don't care! I don't care about that! Please, don't die!
[Alear] 
It'll be all right... There's still so...much I have to do...
[Alear] 
I can't die until I've told you everything...
There's still...too much left unsaid... Who I...am.
Listen, Veyle, I'm your...

[Alear] 

[Veyle] 
? Huh? No, you can't... 
Don't leave me!
Don't leave me, !

[Vander] 
[Alfred] 3 
[Alfred] 
But how... How could this...
[Alfred] 

[Veyle] 
Wait, the dragonstone!
[Alfred] 

[Veyle] 
But why would...
[Sombron] 
This wayward creature was another of my children.
[Sombron] 
The one you've been searching for all this time.
[Sombron] 
Your brother.
[Sombron] 
This wayward creature was another of my children.
[Sombron] 
The one you've been searching for all this time.
[Sombron] 
Your sister.
[Veyle] 
Huh?
[Sombron] 
The Divine Dragon took the traitor in after the 
events of the last war. Thus the fool did survive.
No child of mine should live as a Divine Dragon. 
Death was this one's inexorable fate.
[Veyle] 
No... But the stone shouldn't break... The stone 
shouldn't shatter unless...
All that time...you were my brother...
I found you... I finally found you!
All that time...you were my sister...
I found you... I finally found you!
Please, don't be gone─I need to talk to you! I don't 
understand why you would sacrifice yourself for me!

[Sombron] 
Such pathetic children. All 12 of the rings are 
finally in my possession.
[Veyle] 
No! Give them back! Now! Those rings belong to 
my brother!
[Veyle] 
No! Give them back! Now! Those rings belong to 
my sister!
Their friends fought so hard even to make it here!
[Sombron] 
Yet, for all of that...I control the Emblem Rings.
Together, their power is so great... Granted once 
every thousand years!
And now, that unrivaled power is mine!

Lady Veyle?!

I don't...want...her to have control!
[Mauvier] 
But Marni broke the helmet!
[Zephia] 
Oh, Mauvier. Simple, simple Mauvier. It was only 
cracked. That certainly weakened it...
But with Lord Sombron's elevation to power, 
the helmet works far better than before.

Lady Veyle... Lord Sombron will gladly welcome 
you as his daughter now.

Good to see you back. Would've had to kill

None of you have the ability to

This is the end... We have no way out.

You're all about to join your beloved

My goal is so close I can taste it, but their kindness

Now go, and reclaim my Emblem Rings at once!
[Veyle] 
I won't!
[Sombron] 
So I see. That is a shame.
Well, then...there is nothing more you can do for me.
And I have never been in the habit...of keeping 
that which has no value.

Aaah! Ngh... Ugh...

Twice now have I struck you down.
But I promise you...no amount of sleep will bring
