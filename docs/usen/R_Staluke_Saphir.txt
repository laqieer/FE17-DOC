[Saphir]
All right! Great hunting today. Well done.
[Saphir]
Couldn't have brought in nearly this much if not
for you, Prince Alcryst. Thanks for coming.
[Alcryst]
Oh, but I barely helped. This is mostly your
handiwork, Saphir.
[Saphir]
Hahaha! Humble as ever, I see!
[Saphir]
Now that we're good on meat for a while,
I think it's going to be fishing next time.
[Saphir]
Care to join me?
[Alcryst]
Me? I don't have much experience with fishing...
[Saphir]
You'll be fine. I'll show you how it's done.
[Alcryst]
I'd feel bad for the fish. Imagine getting yanked
out of the water by someone as useless as me...
[Saphir]
Hahaha!
[Saphir]
Pretty sure the last thing a fish cares about is
who's doing the catching. You'll be fine.
[Alcryst]
I also doubt I'll catch anything. Any bait I offer
is bound to be inferiorâ”€not worth a nibble.
[Saphir]
Nonsense. Stick with me and I promise you'll
get plenty.
[Saphir]
But the real fun comes when I show you how to
cook 'em.
[Alcryst]
You'll teach me how to cook fish? Really?!
[Alcryst]
In that case...perhaps I will give it a try.
[Saphir]
That's what I like to hear. Consider yourself
invited next time I head out.
[Alcryst]
Yes, please! Thank you, Saphir.

[Saphir]
Turns out you're quite the fisherman, Prince
Alcryst! This is a huge haul.
[Alcryst]
I must admit, I'm surprised myself.
[Saphir]
It's your quiet disposition. Those fish never saw
you coming.
[Alcryst]
Do you think we have enough fish to prepare a
full meal?
[Saphir]
Definitely. This'll do nicely, trust me.
[Alcryst]
That's exciting! I can't wait to learn... We'll get
started as soon as we return, right, Saphir?
[Saphir]
Of course.
[Saphir]
So, are you gonna tell me who you're so excited
to cook for, or what?
[Alcryst]
Heh heh... Was it that obvious?
[Saphir]
I noticed you get most excited when you've
got someone else in mind.
[Alcryst]
Well...it's for my mother.
[Alcryst]
I want to prepare something special for her once
this war ends, and fish is her favorite food.
[Saphir]
Ah.
[Alcryst]
When we heard of the Fell Dragon's return, she
moved to a secure palace far from the throne.
[Alcryst]
It feels like it's been so long... I want to treat
her to something special when we're reunited.
[Alcryst]
It's the least I can do. I'm sure she's already
learned about...Father...
[Saphir]
Mm.
[Saphir]
Well, Prince Alcryst, you can count on me.
[Saphir]
I'll teach you everything I know about making
fish taste wonderful.
[Saphir]
We'll start with how to fillet and sear, and then
move on to seasoning and preservation.
[Saphir]
Gotta warn you ahead of time, though. When it
comes to cooking, I'm a strict instructor.
[Alcryst]
Heh heh, uh-oh. I'll be sure to brace myself.

[Alcryst]
Thank you for teaching me to cook, Saphir.
[Alcryst]
Under your guidance, I managed to prepare a
complete fish dinner.
[Alcryst]
When it's safe for Mother to return, I'll be able
to welcome her back with a home-cooked meal.
[Saphir]
My pleasure, really.
[Saphir]
I'm happy to pass on all the lessons my parents
taught me.
[Saphir]
And I think they'd have loved to know their
knowledge would benefit their prince someday.
[Saphir]
Come to think of it, I wish I could tell 'em about
the time I got to cook for King Morion too.
[Alcryst]
Did you?
[Alcryst]
Heh heh... If he were still with us, I'm sure he'd
help himself to several platefuls.
[Saphir]
Ah, sorry to bring up a sore subject...
[Alcryst]
It's all right. I can tell it's a fond memory.
[Alcryst]
I'm happy that there are stories I've never heard
from people who knew him.
[Saphir]
...
[Alcryst]
Saphir? What's the matter?
[Saphir]
It hurts me too. Losing him.
[Saphir]
When I stayed behind at Brodia castle, I took
it for granted he'd be back.
[Saphir]
Now every so often, it hits me that I'll never
see his face again.
[Saphir]
Best I can do is hold tight to the memory.
[Alcryst]
I know exactly what you mean.
[Saphir]
I'm sorry, Prince Alcryst.
[Saphir]
I know my sorrow is nothing compared to what
you and Prince Diamant must feel.
[Alcryst]
Sorrow isn't something that should be
measured...or compared.
[Alcryst]
I know you shared a special bond with my
father as a royal soldier of Brodia.
[Alcryst]
It's important that we all take time to grieve.
I know I am...and I hope you will too.
[Saphir]
Kind words.
[Alcryst]
We should prepare a plate for Father someday.
We've yet to erect a headstone, but...
[Alcryst]
I'm sure he'd appreciate a hearty meal left at his
final resting place. He did love to eat, after all.
[Saphir]
Great idea.
[Saphir]
Yeah, let's do it. Let's leave him a feast fit for
a king.
[Saphir]
Thanks, Prince Alcryst. I feel better already.
