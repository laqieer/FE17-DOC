=== Alear & Lapis ===

[Alear]
Oh, Lapis! I wanted to thank you for all of your
support in our recent battles.
[Lapis]
Oh, I didn't really do much out there.
[Lapis]
I was just following your lead. You don't have
to thank me for that, Divine One.
[Lapis]
There were lots of other, more skilled warriors
in those battles. You should thank them instead.
[Alear]
Lapis, please. You're strong and you think fast.
You should have confidence in your abilities.
[Lapis]
Confidence? I don't know about that...
[Lapis]
I'm thrilled to be a retainer, but everyone else
is much more qualified. I'm not even a noble.
[Lapis]
I wouldn't want to sound arrogant when I rank
so far beneath everyone else.
[Alear]
Wow. You're pretty hard on yourself, huh?
I guess that can be a good motivator...
[Alear]
But you shouldn't compare yourself to others
like that. Everyone has different skills.
[Alear]
Be a little more kind to yourself, OK? Like I said,
you've earned a bit of confidence.
[Lapis]
But... Well, Divine One, I... I'm not sure what to
say to all of that.
[Lapis]
I'm not used to being complimented like this.
[Lapis]
I should go. Please excuse me.

[Alear]
Lapis sounds so sure that she doesn't really
belong here.
[Alear]
There has to be some way to help her work
past that mindset.

[Lapis]
Huh?! You're serious? You really want to train
with me today, Divine One?
[Alear]
Yes! I thought it would be nice to work together
every once in a while.
[Lapis]
That's so exciting! Thank you for carving out
the time.
[Alear]
So, what am I in for, Lapis? What's your usual
training regimen?
[Lapis]
I start with some drills using different weapons,
try a few practice swings...then do heavy lifting.
[Lapis]
I strap a weighted pack to my back and go for
a long run. Sometimes I climb a mountain.
[Alear]
That...seems like it would build up an incredible
amount of endurance.
[Lapis]
Oh, if you're going to train with me, you'll need
a pack too. I'll make you one real quick!
[Alear]
You're going to make a weighted pack?
[Lapis]
Sure! It's not too hard. I had to make most
things by hand back in the countryside.
[Alear]
Countryside?
[Lapis]
Ah!
[Lapis]
Ahh! I...I meant, "can't decide!" I can't decide,
uh, whether to make you a pack or not!
[Alear]
Oh. Well, I'd love it if you did. I think it's really
amazing you can make those kinds of things.
[Lapis]
Ooh, please don't tease me like that.
[Alear]
I'm not teasing. Your crafting skills could be
very useful on the battlefield.
[Alear]
Would you be willing to teach me how to make
a few things? I'd like to learn.
[Lapis]
...
[Lapis]
It feels...strange to be complimented for such
a modest skill.
[Lapis]
But yes, I can show you how to make a pack
right now. Watch closely!
[Alear]
All right.
[Alear]
Whoa! Your hands move so fast! Can we, uh,
go back a few steps?

[Lapis]
Hello, Divine One. I have something for you!
[Alear]
Are these crafting tools?
[Lapis]
Yep! You said you wanted to learn crafting, and
you can't practice without a set of your own.
[Alear]
Thank you for these.
[Lapis]
I should be thanking you, really.
[Lapis]
I've been down on myself for a long time.
You helped me shake some of that off.
[Lapis]
Your kind words about my crafting skills made
me feel more confident in myself.
[Alear]
Good! You really are amazing, Lapis.
[Alear]
I watched you make that weighted pack like it
was nothing. I still have a lot to learn from you.
[Lapis]
OK! I could show you how to make a rake.
[Alear]
A rake? What would we use that for?
[Lapis]
Harvesting taters.
[Alear]
Taters.
[Lapis]
Yeah! I can make a rake that works on all kinds.
Potatoes, sweet potatoes, Brodian yams...
[Alear]
Brodian yams?
[Lapis]
Well, Brodia is in the name, but they can grow
everywhere. I even found a few near here!
[Lapis]
They're so sweet when you boil them... Ugh,
now I want some. Let's get started on that rake!
[Alear]
Amazing. Like I said, I still have a lot to learn
from you, Lapis.

[Alear]
Hello, Lapis. Do you have a moment?
[Lapis]
Sure, Divine One! What can I do for you?
[Alear]
Well...I want you to have this.
[Lapis]
Wow. What is this? The metalwork is beautiful.
It looks all fancy and expensive... Ah! Wait!
[Lapis]
Is... Is this the Pact Ring?!
[Alear]
It is. Look at the back side.
[Lapis]
Why is my name engraved here?
[Alear]
I carved it there using the crafting tools you
gave me.
[Lapis]
What? You did this to the ring yourself? Using
the tools I made for you?!
[Lapis]
Ahh, an engraving like this can't be removed!
Why did you do this?
[Alear]
I have no intention of undoing it. I carved your
name into it because I want you to have it.
[Alear]
What do you say, Lapis? Will you wear the
Pact Ring?
[Lapis]
...
[Lapis]
You know, there was a time when a situation
like this would've had me fleeing in shame...
[Lapis]
But...I care about you, Divine One. And it
doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.
[Alear]
Does that mean...
[Lapis]
Of course. I will accept this ring.
[Lapis]
You took such care in carving my name into it...
How could I possibly say no after that?
[Alear]
Thank you, Lapis. I'm so glad.
[Lapis]
Um... I actually have something important to tell
you, Divine One. You see, I...
[Alear]
You're from a village of yam farmers, right?
Way out in the Brodian countryside?
[Lapis]
Huh? How did you know that?!
[Alear]
I read up on Brodian yams. It's just a nickname.
The only people who call them that are...
[Lapis]
Yam farmers. Ugh. My secret is out...but I think
I'm glad. That's a big part of who I am.
[Alear]
Indeed. And I'm giving you the Pact Ring
because of who you are, Lapis.
[Lapis]
Thank you, Divine Dragon ...
[Lapis]
You'll be safe with me. It turns out we're both
pretty crafty...so let's carve out a better world!
