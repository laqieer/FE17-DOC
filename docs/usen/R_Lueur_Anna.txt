[Anna] 
Hmm. Maybe I'm coming at this wrong.
[Alear] 
What're you thinking about, Anna?
[Anna] 
That's Lady Anna to you! But to answer your 
question, I'm brainstorming new products.
[Alear] 
More stuff to sell, huh?
[Anna] 
Yup. You know what Sweethearts Day is?
[Alear] 
I think I've heard of it. It's where couples give 
each other gifts, right?
[Anna] 
That's the one.
[Anna] 
Usually people just give each other flowers, but 
the same old gift every year loses its luster.
[Anna] 
So I'm out to market something mind-blowing 
that'll bring the spark back to Sweethearts Day!
[Alear] 
Wow. That's a pretty lofty goal.
[Anna] 
Quit treating me like a kid and help me out 
here, Divine One.
[Anna] 
Nothing I've come up with so far has grabbed 
me, so I could use someone else's input.
[Alear] 
Hmm... Let's see here. Something new for 
Sweethearts Day...
[Alear] 
How about necklaces?
[Anna] 
Haha, I see you have your finger on the pulse 
of the average Sweethearts Day participant.
[Anna] 
Necklaces are almost as played-out as flowers. 
They're hardly going to blow anyone's mind.
[Alear] 
I see.
[Anna] 
Customers don't want something they can get 
anywhere. They want something one-of-a-kind.
[Anna] 
The constant need to come up with goods like 
that is what makes my line of work so tricky.
[Alear] 
Got it. I'll keep thinking. We'll come up with 
something good eventually!

[Alear] 
Hello, Lady Anna. Did you ever get a good idea 
for something to sell?
[Anna] 
No. The idea well's run dry.
[Anna] 
...
[Alear] 
Oh... Are you crying?
[Anna] 
No!
[Anna] 
But I am feeling a little down. You know, I tell 
everyone I'm not just a kid.
[Anna] 
Stuff like this reminds me that I amâ”€I'm a kid, 
and that's all there is to it.
[Anna] 
It's why I can't think of a single new product 
for Sweethearts Day.
[Alear] 
I'm sorry, Lady Anna. Though, I think I know 
how I can help.
[Anna] 
Huh?
[Alear] 
I have a new pitch for something you can sell.
[Alear] 
I've been thinking about it for a while, actually. 
Here it is...handcrafted necklaces!
[Anna] 
Necklaces again? We've been over this!
[Alear] 
I know you mentioned that they're a pretty 
common Sweethearts Day gift.
[Alear] 
But handcrafted ones would each have a unique 
feel to them. That's what you're after, isn't it?
[Alear] 
I seem to remember glassblowing being a 
popular handicraft where you're from.
[Alear] 
Add a string to that and you've got a necklace!
[Anna] 
...
[Alear] 
Was it that bad of an idea?
[Anna] 
No, no, I like it! This could really sell.
[Anna] 
Aww, thanks a bunch, Divine One! You've really 
lit a fire under me!
[Alear] 
Glad I could help, Lady Anna.

[Alear] 
How are the necklaces coming along?
[Anna] 
Hey, Divine One! Happy to report that I'm about 
halfway done.
[Alear] 
Wow. These are turning out really cute.
[Anna] 
Credit to you for the idea. Seriously, thank you!
[Anna] 
Sorry I complained to you before. If I can pull 
this off, there'll be no more complaints from me.
[Alear] 
That's very grown-up of you.
[Alear] 
Although everyone complains sometimes. 
Even adults.
[Alear] 
If something's frustrating you, you can always 
talk to me about it.
[Anna] 
I'm so happy to hear you say that! I really owe 
you for this, Divine One.
[Anna] 
That reminds me. I was thinking I'd call these 
necklaces "Divine Dragon Pendants."
[Alear] 
What?
[Alear] 
I appreciate the thought, but maybe you should 
name them something that would sell better.
[Anna] 
It's so cute that you're shy about it! But I'm 
definitely calling them that now.
[Alear] 
Come on! Why don't you sleep on it? I'm sure 
you can come up with something punchier!
[Anna] 
Lalalala! I can't hear you!
[Anna] 
As soon as I finish the rest of these babies up, 
they'll sell out on day one.
[Alear] 
Ah... Well, I guess I can let the name slide as 
long as you're enjoying yourself.
[Alear] 
Fingers crossed that business booms for you, 
Lady Anna.

[Alear] 
Today's Sweethearts Day, isn't it? How's the 
new product selling?
[Anna] 
Already sold out.
[Alear] 
Really?!
[Anna] 
Yeah, really! Those suckers practically flew 
off the shelves!
[Alear] 
Wow. Congratulations, Lady Anna.
[Anna] 
It wouldn't have happened without you, 
Divine One.
[Alear] 
It's too bad I didn't get to see any of the 
finished necklaces, though.
[Anna] 
Actually... I did keep one. Check it out.
[Alear] 
Oooh! You did a great job with this. No wonder 
they sold so quickly.
[Anna] 
You can keep it if you want.
[Alear] 
Huh? You're sure?
[Anna] 
That one wasn't for sale. It came out the best, 
so I set it aside just for you.
[Anna] 
I hope you like it.
[Alear] 
This is the best one? You really don't mind if 
I have it?
[Anna] 
I wouldn't say it if I didn't mean it!
[Anna] 
I just...you know...really appreciate how much 
you help me out.
[Alear] 
That's kind of you to say.
[Anna] 
We made a good team, coming up with this 
product together. I'm really grateful.
[Anna] 
So I thought you should have the best one as a 
sign of our friendship.
[Alear] 
Aww.
[Alear] 
I'm happy it worked out so well. And I'm 
honored to accept the necklace. Thank you.
[Alear] 
You know what? I have a gift for you too. 
It's the Pact Ring.
[Anna] 
What?! Oh, come on! That thing's way 
too valuable.
[Alear] 
That's exactly why I want you to have it. 
The best goods are one-of-a-kind, right?
[Alear] 
I got a memento of our great teamwork, so why 
shouldn't you?
[Anna] 
True... We did come up with a smash hit, so 
I guess that does make us partners after all.
[Anna] 
All right, all right, I'll take it. What a great day 
this is turning out to be!
[Alear] 
Hahaha, I agree.
[Anna] 
Right, then. Starting tomorrow, we've got a lot 
of work ahead of us.
[Anna] 
First, we need to source artisans who can mass- 
produce those necklaces.
[Anna] 
If you thought they sold quick before, wait until 
people find out the Divine Dragon wears one!
[Alear] 
Hahaha! How mercenary of you. Never change, 
Lady Anna.
[Alear] 
I can't let my business partner go soft, right?
[Anna] 
Nope! This partnership is our ticket to fame, 
fortune, and finding my family!
