[Goldmary]
♪Hmm-hmm...♪ It's a wonderful day
for laundry.
[Goldmary]
Wash, rinse, dry, starch, fold... Every step with
precision and grace.

[Yunaka]
Look at you, enjoying your chores! Is that
even allowed?
[Goldmary]
I should hope so. Ah, I love laundry.
[Goldmary]
Care to join me?
[Yunaka]
Me? Eh... I'll pass.
[Goldmary]
Are you sure?
[Goldmary]
You might discover that washing clothes on a
sunny day is refreshing and restorative.
[Goldmary]
Keeping neat and clean won't exactly lose you
any friends either.
[Yunaka]
Yeah, I don't care about that.
[Goldmary]
Or maybe you've got something hidden among
your unmentionables and don't want me to see?
[Yunaka]
What?! Gross, no!
[Goldmary]
I suppose I'll take your word for it.
[Yunaka]
Look, it's just...better if I decline. Sorry.
[Goldmary]
Why is that?
[Yunaka]
It just is. I'd rather not get into why.
[Yunaka]
Actually, I'd better go. See you around.
[Yunaka]
[Goldmary]
I wonder what that was about.

[Goldmary]
♪Hmm-hmm...♪ Love to make the
dishes sparkle.
[Goldmary]
Each polished plate rewards me with a view
of my own scintillating smile...

[Yunaka]
There you are, Goldmary. Look, I...wanted to
apologize to you about the other day.
[Goldmary]
Apologize? Why?
[Yunaka]
You made doing laundry look like lots of fun.
I actually did wanna join you. I just...couldn't.
[Goldmary]
I don't understand. What do you mean?
[Yunaka]
I can explain, but it's...kinda personal.
[Goldmary]
It's all right. Don't be shy.
[Yunaka]
OK, well... I normally hate to bring this up,
but I had a horrible childhood.
[Yunaka]
My parents were too poor to raise me, so I was
abandoned. I ended up living with a...stranger.
[Yunaka]
Even from a really young age, he had me doing
all the housework.
[Yunaka]
So...something about doing chores takes me
right back to that place. It fills me with dread.
[Goldmary]
I had no idea.
[Yunaka]
These days, I always do stuff like laundry
and dishes alone.
[Yunaka]
That way I'm not bothering anybody if I go to
pieces over it.
[Goldmary]
I understand.
[Yunaka]
But I'm not here to make excuses. I'm
determined to put my past behind me.
[Yunaka]
I wanna be a totally new person.
So in the spirit of a fresh start...
[Yunaka]
Let's do some chores!
[Goldmary]
I admire your courage, Yunaka. In that case,
please join me in washing the dishes.
[Yunaka]
You got it, Goldmary!

[Yunaka]
Hey, Goldmary. I'm sorry for ruining all your
fun the other day.
[Yunaka]
Even just the thought of housework makes
me fall apart so fast.
[Goldmary]
Don't worry yourself about that.
[Goldmary]
As it happens, I've been thinking it over since
then. And I may have an idea.
[Goldmary]
I heard that you're gifted at impersonation.
Is that true?
[Yunaka]
Sure. I mean, I'm decent at it.
[Goldmary]
Would you like to try impersonating me?
[Yunaka]
What? Why?
[Goldmary]
Humor me. Show me what I was like washing
clothes the other day.
[Yunaka]
OK, if you insist. I think that went a little
something like...
[Yunaka]
"♪Hmm-hmm...♪ It's a wonderful day
for laundry."
[Yunaka]
"Wash, rinse, dry, starch, fold... Every step with
precision and grace."
[Goldmary]
Wonderful. Keep that up, and follow me. We'll
do laundry as two Goldmarys.
[Yunaka]
Sounds weird. Let's give it a go!
[Goldmary]
So, how did you feel? Any of the old dread?
[Yunaka]
Amazingly, no. Not even a little!
[Yunaka]
I was so focused on being you that I totally
forgot about my past!
[Goldmary]
Perfect. Exactly as planned.
[Goldmary]
From now on, whenever you need to do chores,
you can just pretend to be me.
[Goldmary]
Once you form the habit, I think you'll find
chores far less worrisome.
[Goldmary]
There's no easy cure for a wound like yours,
but take it one small step at a time. You'll heal.
[Yunaka]
So that's what you had in mind.
[Yunaka]
Great idea, Goldmary! You're a genius.
[Yunaka]
I said I wanted to be a new person, and now
I have someone to be─you!
[Goldmary]
I suppose there are worse goals to have.
Consider me honored.
[Goldmary]
I'm sorry if my perfection is too much for you.
But it's good to aim high, of course.
[Yunaka]
Ooh, that's good. You're good. I need to start
taking notes.
[Yunaka]
"I'm sorry if my perfection is too much for you."
To be said coyly in response to praise.
[Goldmary]
You're a little too quick a study! You don't have
to imitate everything I say...
[Yunaka]
Hehe! Only kidding. But now I've got your
flustered face in my back pocket too!
[Yunaka]
Thanks for taking me under your wing. I know
I can be a handful.
[Goldmary]
My pleasure. If you want me to be your teacher,
I will happily accept you as a student.
