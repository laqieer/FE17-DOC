=== Diamant & Veyle ===

[Veyle]
Diamant, is there anything that's troubling
you right now?
[Diamant]
Lady Veyle? Why the sudden concern?
[Veyle]
I did...something awful to you. I want to atone
for what I've done...if I can.
[Diamant]
Do you mean my father? You don't need to
atone for that. You weren't yourself then.
[Veyle]
Still, I want to make things right.
[Diamant]
I see. If I were in your position, I would be
offering the same sort of gesture.
[Diamant]
I have to be honest... Nothing is troubling me at
the moment.
[Diamant]
Though, I wonder... Would you be interested in
working with me to help other people?
[Veyle]
Other people?
[Diamant]
As the crown prince of Brodia, easing the minds
of the people in my kingdom is my job.
[Diamant]
If you help me alleviate their burdens, I would
consider that a great service.
[Diamant]
What do you say, Lady Veyle?
[Veyle]
I'd say yes, I like the sound of that very much!

[Veyle]
Hmm, how strange.
[Veyle]
We walked around town all day long and
couldn't find anyone who needed our help.
[Diamant]
I'm surprised too. Not a single person was
distressed or in need of assistance...
[Diamant]
I suppose that's an odd thing to be upset about.
We should be glad.
[Diamant]
I'm grateful that today was a good day for
my people.
[Veyle]
Yes, but...that won't help me make up for what
I did to you.
[Diamant]
Well, not today, no...but how about this?
[Diamant]
Someday, something will trouble me. When that
day comes...promise you'll help me solve it.
[Diamant]
Will that suffice, Lady Veyle?
[Veyle]
Yes, it will. Thank you, Diamant.

[Veyle]
Hello, Diamant. Tell me, is anything troubling
you today?
[Diamant]
Ah. Normally I would give you the same "not
today" reply, but not this time...
[Diamant]
Something is troubling me.
[Veyle]
Really?!
[Veyle]
I will solve it, I promise! Just tell me what it is.
[Diamant]
We went through town before to try and find
people who needed help. Remember?
[Veyle]
Of course. We didn't find anyone, though.
Not a single person.
[Diamant]
Yes, well, I spoke with a guard who told me
the townsfolk actually have a lot of problems.
[Veyle]
But...why didn't they tell us?
[Diamant]
Everyone knows that I'm the crown prince, so
they're afraid to approach me or speak with me.
[Veyle]
Oh, I see...
[Diamant]
I must find a way to let my people know that
I want─ No, I need to hear from them.
[Diamant]
I'm just not sure how to do that...
[Veyle]
Oh! That's easy! I know exactly what to do.
[Diamant]
If you have an idea, I'm all ears.
[Veyle]
Well, there's a type of food I really love. It's
delicious and very exciting to eat.
[Veyle]
So I could prepare the food, and you could host
a banquet. It would be our treat to everyone.
[Diamant]
Ahh, I see...
[Diamant]
If we host an informal dinner for the town, then
people might not find me so intimidating...
[Veyle]
Exactly! Food is the perfect way to win people's
hearts. I'll begin preparations immediately.

[Diamant]
This is bad. We have to do something...
[Veyle]
I've ruined the banquet. I'm sorry, Diamant.
[Diamant]
I had no idea your favorite dishes were all so
incredibly, dangerously spicy.
[Diamant]
We can't serve this to the townsfolk...can we?
[Veyle]
I─ I don't know.
[Veyle]
I love super spicy food. I just assumed everyone
else would love it too. I'm so, so, so sorry.
[Diamant]
You did nothing wrong, Lady Veyle. It's my
fault for not asking about the menu before now.
[Veyle]
I wanted to help, but all I did was make more
trouble for you.
[Veyle]
I really thought we could make everyone smile.
[Diamant]
Make everyone smile...
[Diamant]
That's it! I've got it!
[Veyle]
You do?
[Diamant]
We'll turn this dinner into a spicy-food eating
contest. That's guaranteed to liven things up.
[Veyle]
A contest to see who has the...toughest mouth?
That will help you connect with people?
[Diamant]
As opposed to a quiet meal? In Brodia? Yes!
I'll be laughing and cheering right beside them.
[Veyle]
That's wonderful! I get to help you and you
get to help your people...with spicy food!
[Diamant]
Today's going to be a good day, Lady Veyle.
[Veyle]
Just so you know, I will probably win the
contest.
[Diamant]
Ha! I won't be easy to beat, that I promise you.
[Veyle]
We'll find out soon enough. Everyone is on
their way. The heat is on!
