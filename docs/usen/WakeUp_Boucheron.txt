Divine One? Is it all right if I come in?


Right, so... How do I do this?
You're an important person, so I'd better be 
polite about it.
Divine One? Divine One...


Phew.
Good morning.
Vander asked me to wake you up today, so 
that's what I did.


Oh, you woke up fast.
Guess I'll be on my way, then.


--- C2 ---

Haah... Haah...
Finally made it...


Sorry I'm late.
I knew it couldn't be far, but...
I somehow ended up on the other side of 
the Somniel.


Morning.
You may have overslept.
I got a bit lost.


Morning!
I got kind of turned around looking for 
this place.


--- B1 ---

It's Boucheron, Divine One. Hope I'm not 
disturbing you.


Ah, I just took a nice walk.
The Somniel's huge, but the relaxing scenery's 
worth the hike.


Hey, Divine One. What do you say we go for a 
morning stroll?
And, uh, you can lead the way!


Huh? You're already up?
Are my footsteps really that loud?


--- B2 ---

Wow, I found it quick this time!


Hey.
Remember me getting lost...
up in those mountains?
Well I found my way here perfectly. First 
try too!


Morning.
Everyone's waiting, so let's head over this way.
What? That's the wrong way? It can't be... I was 
so sure...


Look at me, waking you up on time today.
Aren't you proud of me?


--- A1 ---

I brought something to make your sleep more 
relaxing, Divine One.


Pure mountain water.
Listen to the sound.
Soothing, isn't it? Peaceful.


Good morning.
Huh? You're going back to sleep already?
Oh no, the water was too calming!


Looks like you're already awake.
I guess my idea can wait until next time.


--- A2 ---

Am I actually early today? Huh.


I don't want to wake you too soon...
so I'll read "Love in Bloom: The Lost Chapters."
Oh no... It's a tearjerker right from the start...


...
Oh, good morning, Divine One.
Sorry, this book got me misty...


Hello there.
I was expecting to be late, so I decided to set 
out early.
A little too early, as it happens. Oh well! 
I'm enjoying it.


--- S1 ---

Oh, thank goodness. I'm finally starting to learn 
my way around.


Still...it's a strange feeling.
Until recently, I was just an ordinary knight.
Now, the Divine Dragon...
Ah, just thinking about the Pact Ring has me 
getting teary...
You asked me to stay with you.
There's nowhere I'd rather be.


There I go getting misty again. Sorry about that.
I just can't seem to stop the waterworks when 
I'm around you.
I'm too happy.


Good morning.
Hahaha, are you concerned about me being 
able to escort you out?
You've got nothing to worry about. I know the 
way just fine by now.


--- S2 ---

How about a stroll through the forest, 
Divine One?
Oh, you're still asleep.


I still feel bad about waking you.
You're safe and sound in your dreams, far away 
from the war.
I can cry enough for the both of us, so...
stay there a while longer.
Don't worry about a thing. I'll always be here 
to protect you.


Hey.
Let's forget our troubles and go somewhere 
nice today.
Anywhere you want. You know I'm always 
ready to follow you.


Oh, haha! You woke up fast!
Not to brag, but...
I wonder if that's because I came to see you?
