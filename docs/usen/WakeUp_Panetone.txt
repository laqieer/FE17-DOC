Fair morning to you, Divine One.


It is difficult to relax in a room that's so...white.
I should think...
black would go quite nicely in here.


Hmm...perhaps I misjudged.
For you...
a pure white room is best, after all.


Aren't you bright-eyed?
I am very much not a morning person.
Surely I could learn a thing or two from you.


--- C2 ---

So hot and humid.
Surely sleep has been difficult.


Ooo, look at that!
A blood-sucking bug!
Aww, but you mustn't bite the Divine Dragon.
Guess it's squishin' time! Eh!


Suck on that, heh!
Ahem, haha.
You are awake, I see.
Apologies, but an intruder needed dispatching.


Did all the insects wake you?
Ugh, this heat!
It brings them out.


--- B1 ---

I hear this place is haunted.
Oh! But this room belongs to the Divine Dragon!


Strange...
Not a single ghost in sight.
But get a load of that spider over there! Aw!
Aren't you a cute fella. Here, lemme give 
ya a pet.


Divine One!
Pardon my intrusion.
I was hunting ghosts...
but found a new friend instead.


Apologies.
It's just...
ghosts.
I was told I might find them here.
Oh, no! I didn't mean to frighten you!


--- B2 ---

Come now, it is time to continue on with your 
brawling lessons.


Hmm...you slumber even as I draw near.
What if I were a villain?!
These sleepy reflexes of yours will need to be 
compensated for.


Divine One! You woke too slowly!
So, we shall polish your attack strength.
You must knock out your foes, even when 
you sleep in!


Ah!
Impressive agility!
With reflexes such as yours...
you could fend off an attack while sleeping.


--- A1 ---

Ugh, is it me, or are our enemies gettin' 
stronger by the day?


I gotta toughen up so I can take those 
knuckleheads out with one blow!
They won't know what hit 'em!
I'll give 'em a little of this─gah! And this─ooh!


Divine One!
You were awake?
The entire time?!
Haha... Please, forgive my uncivilized behavior.


Fair morning!
I've decided to redouble my training regimen.
I shall drill until I can beat our enemies 
to a pulp!
Eh, I mean...until I can subdue our adversaries.


--- A2 ---

Oh, excuse me, Divine One, for barging in while 
you're at rest.


But there's a letter.
It is from the investigator.
Hm, yes, I see.
The whereabouts of my parents... 
remain unknown.


Apologies.
You said you wanted to help me search 
for them.
Thank you for that. It means a great deal to me.


My! Impressive reflexes!
It seems you've been honing your senses.
I should surprise you more often just to keep 
you on your toes.


--- S1 ---

It is with the utmost anticipation that I have 
been awaiting this wake-up visit.


The Divine Dragon has honored me with the 
Pact Ring.
Surely I must make myself more dignified 
than I am.
Though, is that truly what you want when it's 
just us two?
No. I think perhaps not.
You are tenderhearted and kind...
and, my Divine One, I know you accept me 
however I am.


Good morning.
Could we stay like this a bit longer?
I'll tell you a little secret...
The happier I feel, the stronger I am.


Pardon?
Ah, I see. You want me to feel at ease 
around you.
But I promise, there's no one I feel more 
myself around...
than you, Divine One.


--- S2 ---

Good morning.
Now, let's see, how are your reflexes today?


When you gave me the Pact Ring...
you told me everyone has their ups and downs.
But you and I...we've only had ups.
I want to be like this with each other always.
I want to protect you and, more than anything...
I want to evade any downs we face together.


Haha! I knew it.
You were awake the whole time, weren't you?
I miss nothing...
when it comes to the one I adore.


Aha!
A nimble wakeup, indeed.
No need to worry...
I won't judge too harshly if you sleep in 
now and then.
