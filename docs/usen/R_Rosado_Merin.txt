=== Rosado & Merrin ===
--- C ---


[Merrin]
Ah, Rosado. This was always meant to be
our fate.
[Rosado]
I know. This had to happen.
[Rosado]
The last thing I want to do is fight a friend, but
our destiny is inescapable.
[Merrin]
Agreed. We have no choice but to battle it out
here and now, fair and square!
[Merrin]
Let's do this!
[Rosado]
Cool versus cute!
[Merrin]
The superior style wins!
[Rosado]
You're a devoted student of cool, while I've
dedicated my life to the pursuit of cute.
[Merrin]
A twist of fate brought us together, and now
it's up to us to decide which force is stronger.
[Merrin]
So, here's what we're going to do...
[Merrin]
You find the cutest object you can. I find the
coolest object I can. Then...the big reveal!
[Merrin]
We show these objects to one another, and
whoever's heart is most captivated...loses!
[Rosado]
You're on. I'm going to bring something so
cute your heart will explode!
[Merrin]
Do your worst. Whatever incredibly cool object
I bring...it's going to...blow your mind!
[Rosado]
With that out of the way, let the captivation
competition commence!

[Merrin]
The battle to determine the superior style,
cool or cute, cute or cool...
[Merrin]
It's on, Rosado. You ready?
[Rosado]
You bet I am. This is the moment your heart
is stolen away forever, Merrin.
[Merrin]
Hit me with whatever cute object you brought.
I'm ready!
[Rosado]
Feast your eyes...on THIS!
[Merrin]
What's that...a drawing of some sort?
[Rosado]
Oh, no, no, no. Take a closer look.
[Rosado]
This is a drawing, to scale, of none other than
the northern Elusian miniature woolly hare.
[Merrin]
What?! No!
[Merrin]
The northern Elusian miniature woolly hare is so
tiny and so fluffy and sooo adorable! Look at it!
[Rosado]
Mhm! I happened to come across the little one,
so of course I took the chance and sketched.
[Merrin]
And in such detail! Ugh... You know how much
I adore rare creatures!
[Merrin]
I hate to admit it, Rosado... Your cute drawing
has captivated my heart.
[Rosado]
Looks like I win the day!
[Merrin]
Not so fast. You haven't seen what I brought.
[Merrin]
It's an ornamental hair pin. And there, inlaid
among the filigree, is a detailed wyvern design!
[Rosado]
Oh no. Oh no! Aaah, it's the coolest thing I've
ever seen!
[Merrin]
I know what a big wyvern fan you are.
Your heart didn't stand a chance.
[Merrin]
I mean, look! Each and every one of its fangs
has been painstakingly crafted.
[Rosado]
The craftsmanship is over-the-top magical!
And over-the-top cool!
[Merrin]
Ugh... Cool!
[Rosado]
Aw... Cute!
[Merrin]
This contest...
[Rosado]
Is a stalemate!

[Merrin]
...
[Rosado]
...
[Merrin]
Rosado, I think I finally figured something out.
[Merrin]
We've been at these cool-vs-cute-offs for a
while now, and we still can't declare a winner.
[Rosado]
Agreed. There's no resolving this.
[Rosado]
You've won me over with every single cool
thing you've brought.
[Merrin]
The same goes for me. I've adored every single
cute thing you've shown me.
[Rosado]
There's only one thing we can say for sure.
Coolness and cuteness...are both amazing!
[Merrin]
Yes! It doesn't matter which one wins. What
matters is both are great!
[Merrin]
I'm sorry I dragged this ridiculous competition
on for so long.
[Rosado]
What do you mean?
[Rosado]
It was totally worth the effort. Now we know
that coolness and cuteness measure up equally!
[Merrin]
Hold on.
[Rosado]
What is it, Merrin?
[Merrin]
You were very cool just now, Rosado. Many
times cooler than I've been lately.
[Rosado]
Ah... I could say the same about you, y'know.
But with your cuteness!
[Rosado]
Your satisfied smile every time you got me...
That was so beyond cute.
[Merrin]
Haha. Thanks, Rosado.
[Merrin]
So, how about this... Let's just keep mastering
our own, individual, equally amazing styles.
[Rosado]
I like it. You continue to be the genius of cool,
and I'll keep aspiring to greater heights of cute.
[Merrin]
We can be rivals and we can walk different
paths, and we can still cheer each other on.
[Rosado]
Heh, yes! Rosado and Merrin, best foes forever!
