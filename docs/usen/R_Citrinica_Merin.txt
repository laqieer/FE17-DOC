=== Citrinne & Merrin ===
--- C ---



[Citrinne]
Merrin! I've been meaning to tell you─fighting
alongside you is a thrill. You're quite...cool!
[Merrin]
Me? Cool? Haha, you're too kind.
[Merrin]
But since you mentioned it, can you be more
specific? How, exactly, am I cool? Just curious.
[Citrinne]
Oh, my. Where to start?
[Citrinne]
You just seem so fearless out there! It's like
watching a brave knight in action.
[Merrin]
A brave knight, eh? I like the sound of that.
Anything else?
[Citrinne]
Oh? Shall I go on?
[Merrin]
Well, I try my best to be, as you put it...cool.
But I don't always know if it's working, I guess.
[Citrinne]
That...is a bit unexpected.
[Citrinne]
I wouldn't have guessed that a woman like you
would be concerned with others' opinions.
[Merrin]
Oh, I am. During battle, one must maintain
an air of cool. Revealing weakness can be fatal.
[Merrin]
I mean, lose your cool on the battlefield...or off
the battlefield...and you're asking to get hurt.
[Merrin]
No matter what anyone says, appearances are
important. You see?
[Citrinne]
Yes...I do see. Though it must be very difficult
to keep that in mind on the battlefield...and off.
[Merrin]
I'm sorry, but I better get going. I've got to get
back to my training.
[Merrin]
But thank you for the talk, Citrinne.
[Citrinne]
It was nice to catch up. Best of luck with
your training.

[Merrin]
Whoa! Will you look at that! An endangered
Brodian red swallow! Very rare indeed.
[Merrin]
Wait! Where are you flitting off to now, you
gorgeous thing you? What a beautiful creature...
[Merrin]
Is that an Elusian albatross?! I didn't know they
migrated through here!
[Merrin]
And where do you think you're going?! Please,
take me with you!


[Citrinne]
Um...Merrin? What are you doing?

[Merrin]
...
[Merrin]
I─ Uh, nothing...
[Merrin]
What, uh, are you doing? Wait, were you
watching me just now?
[Citrinne]
Yes... I didn't mean to intrude. I couldn't help
myself actually.
[Citrinne]
Your frolicking reminded me of a clown I once
saw perform.
[Merrin]
Aw...
[Merrin]
You don't say? I, uh, actually... I'm going to
be...in a play! Yes, I am. Me. Merrin.
[Citrinne]
A play? How wonderful!
[Merrin]
Nothing fancy. Just a small production. And you
are exactly right. I am, in fact, playing a clown.
[Citrinne]
Ah, I called it! What an interesting role for you!
[Merrin]
Isn't it though? A real stretch from the calm,
cool, everyday, cool me. I have to act. A lot.
[Merrin]
A real challenge, you know? You can't be this
cool and then be a clown, without digging deep.
[Citrinne]
When is your play? You must tell me so I can
attend on opening night.
[Merrin]
What now?
[Merrin]
I mean, that's a good question. I wrote it down
somewhere. I'll have to check...in my...pockets?
[Merrin]
But...I also heard a rumor it might get canceled.
Not for sure but probably. Definitely for sure.
[Citrinne]
Oh no! Please, if it's a matter of funding, you
must, must, must let me help.
[Merrin]
Nope! Not a money thing. It was...there were...
creative differences! Psh, actors. So difficult!
[Citrinne]
Ah, well, those things always blow over. Let me
know when they find a new date. I'll be there.
[Merrin]
I will be sure to do that.

[Merrin]
Citrinne, I need to talk to you.
[Citrinne]
Merrin! Hello! Have they decided on a new
opening date for your play yet?
[Merrin]
It's about that. I'm so sorry. I...lied about
the play.
[Citrinne]
Oh my. What do you mean?
[Merrin]
I love rare critters. And I spotted not one but
two! I was so excited, I...I acted ridiculous.
[Merrin]
Then you saw me, and that lie...it just flew out
of my mouth...like an Elusian albatross.
[Citrinne]
An Elusian alba─ Wait, I'm not sure I follow...
Why would you lie about a thing like that?
[Merrin]
You told me you thought I was cool, remember?
Well, you caught me being...a clown.
[Merrin]
I did NOT want you to see me like that. And I
didn't want to disappoint you.
[Citrinne]
Ah, I think I understand.
[Merrin]
I'm sorry, I won't lie to you again. And I won't
let you see me act so disgracefully either.
[Citrinne]
Merrin, you needn't worry about any of that.
[Citrinne]
I'm not disappointed, and I don't think you did
anything disgraceful.
[Citrinne]
I'm actually thankful to have caught a glimpse
of the real you.
[Merrin]
I don't understand.
[Citrinne]
It's like I discovered an entirely new, entirely
charming side of you!
[Merrin]
A charming side? What do you mean?
[Citrinne]
I see your cool side during battle...and now I
know you have a cute side around animals.
[Merrin]
I don't know about that...
[Citrinne]
Tell me, Merrin... Have you heard of a certain
forest in Brodia that's home to rare wildlife?
[Merrin]
I have. It's on the royal family's private
property.
[Citrinne]
Would you like to visit it together when this war
is over? I could reserve a day for the two of us.
[Citrinne]
There's a chance we might discover a new
species in there! We should bring a scholar.
[Merrin]
Wait, slow down. Wouldn't that be expensive?
[Citrinne]
Oh, it wouldn't be any trouble─or cost! One of
my relatives owns the forest. They protect it.
[Merrin]
Citrinne, are you related to the royal family?
[Citrinne]
I am! So please, don't worry. That forest will be
a perfect, private spot to frolic among fauna.
[Citrinne]
I want you to fully embrace that adorable,
animal-loving side of yourself once again.
[Merrin]
I don't know what to say. It...means the world
to me.
[Merrin]
Honestly, I can't wait! And I will find a way
to repay you.
[Citrinne]
All I ask is that you help me spot animals during
our trip. You can be my personal wildlife expert!
[Merrin]
Haha, personal wildlife expert. I like that title.
And I can't think of anything I'd like to do more.
