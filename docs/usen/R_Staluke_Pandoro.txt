[Pandreo]
So, Prince Alcryst! What did you think of your
first party?
[Alcryst]
Why... Why did I think I could do that?!
[Pandreo]
Hm. I can see how an all-night blowout would
be kind of overwhelming for a beginner...
[Alcryst]
The music was so loud. Everyone was shouting.
And the dancing─the DANCING!
[Alcryst]
It was like a scene from my worst nightmares.
I shouldn't have joined you. I wasn't ready...
[Pandreo]
Hahaha! Ah, good times.
[Alcryst]
Pandreo, please... I don't think I can do that
again. I'm sorry, but partying is not for me.
[Pandreo]
Hey, hey─let's not be too hasty here.
[Pandreo]
I saw you standing on the sidelines─watching
the action from afar.
[Pandreo]
To really know what it's like, you have to dive
in and lose yourself with the rest of us.
[Pandreo]
I'll be sure to drag you into the crowd next time.
[Alcryst]
No, I can't! I must decline.
[Pandreo]
Now why would you do that? Don't worry,
I'll make sure you have fun.
[Pandreo]
Leave it all to me! AROOO!
[Alcryst]
Y-yes. Of course. Awooo...

[Alcryst]
...
[Alcryst]
I have ringing ears...and wobbly knees...and so,
so many regrets...
[Alcryst]
Why? Why did I give this a second shot?
I already knew I didn't belong there...


[Pandreo]
AR-AR-AROOO!
[Alcryst]
Oh. Pandreo...
[Pandreo]
Prince Alcryst! You had fun this time, right?
I saw you mixing it up on the dance floor!
[Alcryst]
I did join in and try to dance, but...
[Alcryst]
Well, I can only assume that I'm incapable of
enjoying any party.
[Pandreo]
What makes you say that?
[Alcryst]
I had no idea what I was doing back there.
[Alcryst]
Everyone around me was whirling and gyrating
so effortlessly. I only know formal dances!
[Alcryst]
And the howling! I do not understand why
everyone keeps howling! My skull is rattling...
[Pandreo]
Ah. Now I see the problem.
[Pandreo]
Listen, Your Highness. There's something
I forgot to tell you.
[Pandreo]
At a party, you don't need to worry about
whats, whys, and hows. It's not that deep.
[Alcryst]
Really? Are you sure?
[Pandreo]
Yep! There's no correct way to dance. And as
for the howls... They don't mean anything!
[Alcryst]
So all of the cheering and dancing is...chaotic
on purpose? People are just making it up?
[Pandreo]
Exactly. It's about getting lost in the motion
and having fun. Other than that, anything goes.
[Alcryst]
I was trying so hard to understand the structure
of the party─the behaviors and movements...
[Alcryst]
I was in my own head, not on the dance floor.
I wasn't embracing the spontaneity.
[Pandreo]
Let's give it another shot! You, me, a solid beat,
and two completely empty heads!
[Pandreo]
AROOO!
[Alcryst]
Awooo!

[Pandreo]
Your Highness.
[Alcryst]
Pandreo...
[Alcryst]
...
[Alcryst]
AWOOO!
[Pandreo]
Haha! AROOO!
[Alcryst]
That party was amazing! I had such a fun time.
[Alcryst]
I shouted until I was out of breath. I let my body
dance and sway all on its own...
[Alcryst]
And I had so, so much fun!
[Alcryst]
This is what it's like to party... It feels as if I've
crossed over into a new world!
[Pandreo]
Aw, yeah! Welcome to the wild world of parties!
[Alcryst]
Thank you for guiding me, Pandreo.
[Alcryst]
I came very close to fleeing again. I started to
dance, and I felt so self-conscious...
[Alcryst]
But then I saw you, limbs flailing, torso twisting,
dancing without a shred of shame...
[Alcryst]
I suddenly felt this wave of relief. I cast aside
my own hesitation and just...danced.
[Alcryst]
Thanks to your erratic and incomprehensible
dance moves, I was finally able to enjoy myself.
[Pandreo]
You know, it's funny.
[Pandreo]
My friends like to make fun of the way I dance.
They call it the Dance of Darkness.
[Pandreo]
But today, it was the Dance of Light─
illuminating your soul like a big, bright torch.
[Alcryst]
Yes! That's exactly how it felt, Pandreo!
[Alcryst]
Parties are so wonderful. I know we just left
one, but can we go to another soon?
[Pandreo]
We'll go to as many as you like, bud! There's
always another bash on the horizon.
[Alcryst]
Pandreo, I... I...
[Pandreo]
Just let it out, Your Highness.
[Alcryst]
AWOOO!
[Pandreo]
AROOOOO!
