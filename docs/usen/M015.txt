[Seadall]
My new moves are coming together nicely.
Just a bit more practice and I'll call it a day.
And this spot...it's perfect for rehearsal.
So quiet and empty.
Hm?
Raaargh...
[Seadall]
Ah! Wh-what is that?!
Raaargh!
[Seadall]
No good. I'm trapped here. Is it my fate to die
like this?
It's such a pity to be caught so unprepared.
I'd have practiced combat as well as dance.
[Corrin]
Hurry! You must get to safety, now!
[Seadall]
Who said that?
[Corrin]
Oh, thank goodness. You can hear what I'm saying,
can't you? Follow the sound of my voice.
[Corrin]
You can hide in here!
There's a door to your right! Now go─hurry!
[Seadall]
I'm coming!




[Alear]
Is the Northern Fortress that frightening?
[Timerra]
Yup. My ancestors designed it that way.
Didn't want people to go poking around.
The locals won't get near the place. They say
ghosts wander the ruins.
A haunted castle! Lately, some have heard a
young woman's voice calling out from inside...
[Alear]
...
[Timerra]
Relax! That's just the local lore.
[Alear]
Then why did you make it sound so real?!
[Timerra]
Sorry, sorry. I shouldn't be talking─I've never
even been there.
Mom always told me to stay away so nobody
would figure out the ring's location.
There it is now. The Northern Fortress.
[Alear]
Hm. For an abandoned fortress, it's
awfully noisy...
[Timerra]
Wait a sec... The Corrupted! They've gotten in!
[Alear]
Let's go. We can't let them get the ring.


[Alear]
Oh no...


[Timerra]
Yeah, this place is swarming. Guess it is a little
haunted, huh?
Hang on. Divine One, look! There's
someone here!


[Seadall]
They have us well and truly surrounded─again.
Still, safer inside than out in the open.
Thank you, ring.
[Corrin]
[Corrin]
I was telling you to hide, not come looking
for me.
[Seadall]
How could I stay away? A talking ring! You
really set off those creatures as well.
[Seadall]
Relax
I take it you're a princess, trapped in this
unusual form by a wicked curse. Let me help.
[Corrin]
Actually, I'm─

[Seadall]
No need to persuade me, Your Highness. I'm
not one to doubt an unusual story.

O spirit of the cards! Cast your light upon the
path before us...
[Corrin]
You're a fortune-teller, hm? What are your
cards saying to you?

[Seadall]
Le Dragon... It means help may come from an
unexpected source.
I suppose we'll just have to hold off the beasts
until it arrives.



[Timerra]
That guy's not here to steal the ring.
I think he's trying to protect it.

[Alear]
He's clearly no friend of the Corrupted.
Let's give him a hand. It looks like he could
use one.


--- ED ---



[Alear]
All right. We're safe.
[Timerra]
Hang on. Someone's at the entrance.
[Alear]
Don't tell me. More of the Corrupted?


[Veyle]
Is everyone OK? I saw all those monsters
coming in and got worried.
[Alear]
Veyle?!
[Veyle]
Oh my! We meet again, . Did you
defeat the monsters?
[Alear]
...
Yes, we did. Every last one.
[Veyle]
I'm glad. How have you been?
I was surprised to see you out in that blizzard.
I hope you found the cathedral.
[Alear]
Whatever game you're playing, stop it.
[Veyle]
Huh? Are you mad about something?
[Alear]
Don't act like you forgot. I can see through
your lies now.
[Veyle]
Lies? What do you mean? I promise you,
, I'm not─
[Alfred]
Not a step closer! You stay where you are,
Fell Princess.
[Veyle]
How did you know?!
[Timerra]
[Diamant]
Just looking at you, I feel again the shame of
losing Father...
[Alfred]

[Ivy]
You took my country from me─my father.
What more do you want?
[Alear]
The people you killed...they had families.
But you don't care, do you? All that pain...
You don't even give it a second thought.
[Veyle]
Wait a moment. I... I killed people? Who?
[Alear]
Drop the act! You know what you did! How dare
you show your face here.
You murdered my mother and stole the rings.
[Veyle]
I didn't. I didn't. Please believe me...
[Alear]
Believe you? Like I believed we were friends?
I won't make that mistake again.
[Veyle]
...
[Veyle]

[Ivy]
[Alfred]
We've got to do something!
[Alear]
Let her go. It's probably a trap.
[Alfred]
You're right.
[Diamant]


[Timerra]
Divine One, are you all right?
[Alear]
I'm fine. But the next time I see Veyle, I swear...



[Veyle]
...
I killed people? Stole rings?
Why would I do that? I don't understand!

[Griss]
Lady Veyle! I finally caught up with you.
[Veyle]
Oh, Griss. It's you.
[Griss]
You're a hard girl to find. Why'd you disappear?
Had me all freaked out.
[Veyle]
Papa told you to drag me back home, right?
[Griss]
Told me to... Huh?
Oh, I see what's going on here. You're the
other one.
[Veyle]
I'm not going back, no matter what you say.
Papa will just make me do something cruel.
When he awoke, I thought we could finally
spend time together. But no.
Always telling me to kill the Divine Dragon or
attack so-and-so's castle. Well, I don't want to!
I'm not an evil person. Despite what all those
people said.
Even the Divine Dragon was angry with me.
And I thought we were friends...
[Griss]
The Divine Dragon said you were friends?
Wait─you met the Divine Dragon?!
[Veyle]
Mm-hmm.
[Griss]
Oh, that's...complicated.
Look, whatever those people told you, it's not
true. They were imagining things.
[Veyle]
You think so?
[Griss]
Of course. How could you have done
something bad and then forgotten it?
[Veyle]
Right... Right! I couldn't have!
If only I'd said that before, maybe there
wouldn't be this awful misunderstanding.
[Griss]
You wanna try and speak with 'em again?
Set things straight?
[Veyle]
I do, but... Weren't you going to bring me back?
[Griss]
If this is what you want, I'll help out. Nothing if
not loyal, that's me.
[Veyle]
All right... Thank you, Griss. It seems
I misjudged you.
[Griss]
It's settled, then. Let's head to Firene.
[Veyle]
Firene? Why there?
[Griss]
'Cause that's where the Divine Dragon is going.
[Veyle]
How do you know that?
[Griss]
Come on, we're on a schedule here! Gotta head
for the port and set sail.
Do you wanna patch things up or don't you?
[Veyle]
I do. I do! You're right─no time to waste!
[Veyle]
[Griss]
Heh, this oughta be real interesting.

[Alear]
You there! Are you hurt?

[Seadall]
Who are you?!
[Alear]
Don't worry─I'm not your enemy. I'm the
Divine Dragon .

[Seadall]
The Divine Dragon, you say... What do you
know? My cards spoke true.
Unexpected source indeed. Thank you. I am
Seadall, a traveling dancer.

I was out there rehearsing, and those creatures
appeared. A talking ring called me to safety.

[Alear]
A talking ring, hm?

[Seadall]
Yes. I believe it's a young princess who fell
victim to some sort of curse. Isn't that awful?
&gt;8picture item fade out normal

[Alear]
Not a curse, exactly.

[Seadall]
You know her story, then? Tell me, who is this
mysterious ring woman?
[Alear]
Hand it to me, and we'll find out together.
[Seadall]
All right.

[Corrin]

I am Emblem Corrin. I'll fight with all I have.
Thank you for finding me. I'll help ensure the
path you decide to walk is the right one.

[Alear]
Thank you, Emblem Corrin. I'm sorry I kept you
waiting for so long.
[Corrin]

[Seadall]
An Emblem, really? One of the godlike figures
of legend...
[Alear]
Seadall, would you fight by Corrin's side?
We could use your help getting out of here.

[Seadall]
It would be my pleasure. This world... Wonders
upon wonders.


[Alear]
Huh? Did those doors just...


[Alear]
We won't be able to escape the way we came
in. Let's try that path over there.


[Seadall]
Divine One, as a dancer, I can raise your allies'
spirits with my graceful movements.
Please, call upon my abilities as you see fit.


[Seadall]
I was in such a rush earlier, I didn't notice the
miasma all over the place.
[Corrin]
The creatures must have brought it with them─
it certainly wasn't here before.
Use my power to dispel the miasma and open a
path for your allies.

[Seadall]
Relax

[Seadall]
Our paths diverge for a moment. Divine One,
Emblem Corrin... Thank you.

[Alfred]
More?! Divine One, we can't keep this up. Time
to make our escape.

[Seadall]
So this was the fates' intention after all.
Please... Protect Emblem Corrin...
