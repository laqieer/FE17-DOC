=== Kagetsu & Merrin ===
--- C ---

[Kagetsu]
Aw...
[Kagetsu]
How could I be so foolish? Dropping my onigiri,
my one and only lunch... What do I do?
[Kagetsu]
I had so much to do today. Now I fear I will
collapse from hunger...

[Merrin]
You look like you could use a snack. Do you
like sweets? I have some to share.
[Kagetsu]
Merrin?
[Kagetsu]
You would help me in my hour of need?
My gratitude knows no bounds...
[Kagetsu]
With all my heart, thank you...
[Merrin]
You're very welcome. Enjoy.
[Kagetsu]
Sweet... And delicious! Oh, now I am full
of energy!
[Merrin]
Wow, you devoured those. You must've been
very hungry.
[Kagetsu]
Yes! That hit all my spots. Thank you!
[Kagetsu]
Now I can challenge Princess Timerra to single
combat without worry!
[Merrin]
Excuse me?!
[Merrin]
You're going to challenge my princess to a
fight? No! No, you certainly will not!
[Kagetsu]
Why not? Fighting strong opponents is fun.
[Kagetsu]
I have some skill, so I think Princess Timerra
will find our duel challenging.
[Merrin]
Yes, well, as retainer to Princess Timerra, I will
not allow you to put her in harm's way.
[Kagetsu]
You are much too worried.
[Merrin]
To think, I helped someone who wants to attack
my princess. What a truly unforgivable mistake.
[Merrin]
If you insist on fighting her, you'll have to
defeat me first!
[Kagetsu]
I would gladly take you on.
[Kagetsu]
Ordinarily, at least. But I would not feel right
about repaying you so roughly.
[Kagetsu]
Very well, Merrin. You have persuaded me
to step back from this for now.
[Merrin]
Huh...
[Kagetsu]
You are so wary! I am not lying!
[Kagetsu]
My contest with Princess Timerra will simply
have to wait until another time.

[Kagetsu]
Merrin. Do I have your permission to issue
my challenge to Princess Timerra yet?
[Merrin]
Please. You'll never have my permission.
[Kagetsu]
Truly? I am greatly vexed.
[Kagetsu]
Still, I am in your debt, Merrin. Out of respect,
I will wait until you change your mind.
[Merrin]
You're very aggravating, you know that? Why
must you insist on fighting my princess?
[Kagetsu]
I have journeyed far from Pale Sands in search
of strong opponents to face in battle.
[Merrin]
Pale Sands... You mean the remote region in
Solm? The one shrouded in mystery?
[Kagetsu]
To me, it is everything outside of Pale Sands
that is shrouded in mystery.
[Kagetsu]
That is why I set out on my journeyâ”€to explore
the strange world outside my home.
[Kagetsu]
I have met many strong opponents in
my travels.
[Kagetsu]
I have also seen how each country's customs,
culture, and history inform its fighters.
[Kagetsu]
This is why I seek a duel with Princess Timerra.
I wish to learn more about Solm!
[Merrin]
So that's what this is all about.
[Merrin]
In that case, I will fight you.
[Kagetsu]
You?
[Merrin]
I am a royal knight, and a capable one at that.
Do you doubt I'd make a worthy opponent?
[Kagetsu]
I do not doubt it. But should I defeat you, I will
challenge Princess Timerra next.
[Kagetsu]
Do you have any objections?
[Merrin]
Fine by me. But just a heads-up...you will not
defeat me.
[Kagetsu]
Haha, your confidence is delightful. Come then,
show me what you can do!

[Kagetsu]
Try this!
[Merrin]
Ha! Not good enough, Kagetsu!
[Kagetsu]
Ha!
[Merrin]
Hyah!
[Kagetsu]
...
[Merrin]
And that's that. I win.
[Kagetsu]
I...lost?
[Merrin]
You did. Though, you are just as skilled as I am.
In fact, you might even be stronger than me.
[Merrin]
But I've sworn to protect my princess. And the
power of my conviction will not be overcome.
[Kagetsu]
Conviction, you say...
[Merrin]
I won, Kagetsu. You will not challenge Princess
Timerra, you understand?
[Kagetsu]
Yes... It will be as we agreed.
[Kagetsu]
But perhaps you would consider rematching
me yourself?
[Merrin]
You want to fight me again? Do you mean...as a
substitute for my princess?
[Kagetsu]
No, that is not what I mean.
[Kagetsu]
I have become interested in your power
of conviction.
[Kagetsu]
It clearly gives you great strength.
[Kagetsu]
Studying this will teach me much about your
culture and the world, I feel!
[Merrin]
Ah, in that case, yes. I'd be happy to spar with
you as much as you like.
[Merrin]
In fact, sparring with you will make excellent
training for me as well.
[Kagetsu]
Marvelous! Then let us consider each other
training partners from today!
[Kagetsu]
I am certain this will lead to deep and
meaningful bonds of friendship!
[Merrin]
Haha, I'd like that very much, Kagetsu.
