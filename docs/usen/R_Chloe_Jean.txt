=== Chloé & Jean ===

[Jean]
Um...excuse me, Chloé?
[Chloé]
Well, hello, Jean. Did you need help
with something?
[Jean]
Not exactly. In fact, I thought maybe I could
help you.
[Chloé]
With what?
[Jean]
I'd like you to have this stomach medicine.
[Chloé]
Oh my! Thank you.
[Chloé]
But my stomach's not upset. Why did you think
I needed medicine for it?
[Jean]
Well, you eat so much weird stuff. It's only
a matter of time before it disagrees with you.
[Chloé]
Haha! Are you worried all the folk food I eat
won't sit well with me?
[Chloé]
Don't you worry about that. I've got an
iron stomach.
[Jean]
Still and all, it's good to be prepared.
[Jean]
Just the other day, I saw you stuffing yourself
with what looked like...weird eyeballs.
[Jean]
Whatever that was, there's no way it can be
healthy for you.
[Chloé]
Maybe, but they're so good! I'll save some for
you next time, as thanks for the medicine.
[Jean]
What?! Um, that's OK. Your thanks are enough.
[Jean]
Anyway, be careful. It scares me to think of
what you're putting in your body.
[Chloé]
Sure, I'll be careful. Thanks for looking out for
me, Jean!

[Chloé]
Hey, Jean. Would these herbs be useful?
[Jean]
Definitely! You have a good eye for this, Chloé.
I can use those to relieve fevers.
[Chloé]
Oh! That's good, 'cause I see a lot more
growing just over there!
[Jean]
Thanks for your help. Go ahead and pick a few
more than usual.
[Jean]
It's been really nice having you out here
with me.
[Chloé]
Well, your medicine has been a big help for
all of us, so I'm happy to return the favor.
[Jean]
Still, it's very kind of you.
[Jean]
Just be careful, OK? This part of the forest can
get pretty dark in places.
[Chloé]
Huh, you're right. This is just the kind of forest
that feels like it could be...haAaAuUunted.
[Jean]
Haunted?
[Chloé]
Hahaha, are you scared of ghosts, Jean?
[Jean]
No. The idea of ghosts doesn't frighten me.
[Chloé]
Most children would say that just to sound
brave, but...you mean it, don't you?
[Jean]
A ghost can't really do anything to you. No,
what's much scarier to me is illness and injury.
[Jean]
Things that could actually end someone's life.
[Chloé]
Mmm... Good point.
[Chloé]
In that case, we should gather more herbs so
we can be better prepared for those things.
[Jean]
Right. Many illnesses and injuries are highly
treatable, if you know what to do.
[Jean]
You don't mind staying out with me a little
longer, do you, Chloé?
[Chloé]
Of course not!

[Jean]
Hmm...
[Chloé]
Jean? You seem pale.
[Jean]
I've just been thinking...
[Chloé]
About what?
[Jean]
I'm scared of losing people, Chloé.
[Jean]
Every day on the battlefield, people get hurt.
Some even die.
[Jean]
I've seen things that I could never have
imagined back in my peaceful hometown.
[Jean]
Doesn't any of this scare you?
[Chloé]
Of course it does. And I'm sure we're not the
only ones.
[Chloé]
But there are things we have to do, even if it
means facing our fears to do them.
[Chloé]
That's the thought that drives us all to fight,
day after day. It's what drives me, at least.
[Jean]
Things we have to do, even if it's scary, huh?
[Chloé]
I'm sure you have some too.
[Chloé]
I've seen you stand out on the battlefield
without running from injury or death.
[Jean]
I suppose so. Thank you, Chloé.
[Jean]
It probably won't ever get less scary, but that
doesn't mean I'll run.
[Jean]
Not when I've got a steadfast friend like you.
[Chloé]
"Steadfast"! I like the sound of that.
[Jean]
Besides, you have an iron stomach, right?
People like that are hard to kill.
[Jean]
Although...if your stomach does hurt after
eating something strange, see me straightaway.
[Chloé]
Haha! I'm touched by your concern.
[Jean]
I mean it, OK? Seriously!
[Chloé]
I won't go dying on you, Jean. Not so long as
you're watching out for me.
