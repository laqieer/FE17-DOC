[Timerra] 
Prince Alfred, wait up!
[Alfred] 
Hiya, Princess Timerra. Need something?
[Timerra] 
Hehe! Need's a strong word. I just figured you 
were headed off to eat a snack.
[Alfred] 
Nope. I was about to start my workout.
[Timerra] 
What?! Then why did you have such a big grin 
on your face?
[Alfred] 
Because working out is my favorite part of 
the day!
[Timerra] 
Huh. I guess that tracks. I had it all backwards.
[Timerra] 
Too bad, though. I was about to ask if I could 
come eat with you.
[Alfred] 
Haha, sorry to burst your bubble.
[Timerra] 
Then again, training with you sounds pretty fun. 
Maybe I'll tag along after all.
[Alfred] 
Oh, you're gonna work out with me?
[Timerra] 
Sure, why not! If you insist.
[Timerra] 
Then we can have a nice, yummy meal together. 
Your treat.
[Alfred] 
Ahh, I see what you're doing.
[Alfred] 
Fine by me. I'm not gonna pass up a chance to 
pick the brain of the future queen of Solm.
[Timerra] 
Nothing too heavy, all right? I don't wanna ruin 
the meal by talking shop.
[Alfred] 
Gotcha, Princess Timerra. We'll keep it breezy. 
Nothing heavy at this dinner but the cream.

[Alfred] 
Hey, Princess Timerra. I heard you ride wolves. 
Is that really true?
[Timerra] 
Yup!
[Timerra] 
When I was little, I'd tear through the halls of 
Solm Palace on wolfback. Made a real mess.
[Alfred] 
Impressive! I can't think of anybody that out of 
control in my family.
[Timerra] 
Really? Most of my family is wild in one way 
or another.
[Timerra] 
Oh, that reminds me. How'd you like it if I gave 
you wolf-riding lessons?
[Alfred] 
I was so hoping you'd ask.
[Timerra] 
Fantastic! I'd be happy to show you the ropes.
[Timerra] 
I'm sure you won't mind getting bitten or 
thrown off now and again.
[Alfred] 
As in more than once?!
[Timerra] 
Oh yeah, way more. And when the wolf's really 
agitated like that, I won't be able to call her off.
[Timerra] 
But you can stop her on your own, as long as 
you've got plenty of muscle.
[Alfred] 
Well...
[Timerra] 
Experienced riders can keep their wolves under 
control, but it's a different story for newcomers.
[Timerra] 
I don't mean to scare you though. Most people 
do make it through training with all their limbs.
[Alfred] 
I'm having second thoughts here.
[Alfred] 
Maybe it's better I hold off. Can't let myself get 
sidelined while there's a war on, after all.
[Timerra] 
Yep, yep. Sometimes the bravest thing is 
knowing when to call it quits.
[Alfred] 
Why don't you show me camping instead?
[Alfred] 
It'd be fun to learn how you face the elements 
out in Solm. Even if it's just a little.
[Timerra] 
Oh, absolutely! That does sound fun!
[Timerra] 
I'll teach you everything I know! How to set up 
camp, which animals to watch out for...
[Timerra] 
Oh, oh! And most important of all─singing! 
Nothing beats a good camping song.
[Alfred] 
Great. As soon as I get myself a tent, we'll be 
in business!

♪I went with Alfred on a camping trip...♪
[Timerra] 
♪The food was great and the songs were hip!♪
[Timerra] 
♪There were lotsa stars in the sky that night... 
And that's the end of my song, all right!♪
[Alfred] 
Haha, good one! Way to let everybody know 
just how you feel!
[Timerra] 
Aw, thanks. Most people don't think much of 
my singing.
[Alfred] 
What? Your singing is fantastic! It makes my 
heart swell up inside.
[Timerra] 
Hahaha! That's how it makes me feel too!
[Timerra] 
Thanks, Prince Alfred.
[Timerra] 
Oop! Looks like the fire's petering out.
[Alfred] 
Ooh, allow me. Let's see here...
[Timerra] 
Good work! You've got it down pat.
[Timerra] 
What do you even need me here for? 
You're a natural.
[Alfred] 
Well, I had a great teacher.
[Timerra] 
Hehe! Keep buttering me up, why don'tcha.
[Alfred] 
Thanks again. I've learned so much from being 
around you.
[Alfred] 
It's really helped me get a handle on where your 
people are coming from.
[Timerra] 
Ah! You were trying to gain some firsthand 
experience of Solmic culture, huh?
[Alfred] 
Yeah. I thought if I tried Solm stuff, I'd get to 
know Solm's people.
[Timerra] 
Uh-huh, uh-huh. So then, tell me.
[Timerra] 
Does this mean you're planning to invade?
[Alfred] 
Not at all!
[Alfred] 
I swear, I'm learning all this so I can help bring 
our countries together.
[Timerra] 
Yeah, I know. I'm just yanking your chain.
[Timerra] 
Still, I don't think our work here is done.
[Alfred] 
What makes you say that?
[Timerra] 
Because now it's my turn to learn more about 
the kingdom of Firene.
[Timerra] 
For Solm and Firene to grow closer, they both 
need to understand each other, right?
[Alfred] 
True enough.
[Timerra] 
Well then, for the sake of our countries, you'd 
better tell me all about this homeland of yours.
[Alfred] 
With pleasure, Princess Timerra! Now where 
to begin...
