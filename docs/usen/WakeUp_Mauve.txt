The duties of this army are quite something.


Divine One. It is morning. Wake up, 
if you please.
Why don't you wake?
Curious. Is something wrong?


Ah, you are awake.
Lady Veyle had previously fallen into deep 
slumbers herself...
so I was rather concerned.
I'm grateful all is well.


Good morning.
I have fulfilled the task of waking you...
so I shall take my leave now.

This is a very bright altar. Too bright, really, 
but quite beautiful.


If I had remained one of the Four Hounds...
I would never have come here.
I would never have seen this sight...
I may not even have survived...


You were awake!
I hope I didn't disturb...
I was wrong to make such noise while you slept.
In any case, I will go now. Farewell.


You are awake, Divine One.
Lady Veyle was just saying that she wished 
to meet with you.
I will take my leave.

This seems a wonderful place for prayer.


I wonder if she can hear me from this place.
Please, hear my prayers...Marni.
I am sorry I let you die.
I am sorry I never told you how special 
you were.


I am sorry to have disturbed your sleep.
It was selfish of me. Yet I am glad...
Glad you heard regrets that remain with me still.
I feel as if a part of me was saved.


Pardon me.
May I please enter your room a bit later 
this evening?
I would like to pray at this altar...
for my fallen companion.

I have my duty to wake the Divine Dragon, 
the same as everyone does.


Hm, this thin cloth around the altar blocks 
my way...
Ugh... I'm caught in it!
I must be sure not to tear it. Careful... Careful...


Oh! Good morning!
No, noâ”€there is no particular problem.
I will head into town now...
to atone for my wrongdoings. Goodbye.


I do not know if this is the right time to say 
it, but...
I am still very happy about the time you called 
me a good person.
Goodbye, now.

This is the complete opposite of the altar 
Lady Veyle slept upon.


I admit to missing it sometimes...
Her altar, hidden in a dark forest...
Lady Veyle lay there, serenely...
just like you.


Good morning.
Heh, you really are siblings with Lady Veyle, 
aren't you?
Your face when asleep, how you awaken...
You look just like her.


I shall tell you of it.
That altar was always dark, as if shrouded in an 
endless night.
I was used to it, that darkness, but...
this place is not bad either.

Let us help people again today, Divine One.


I wonder what Queen Lumera would think...
about my setting foot in here.
Or that I would be the one to wake her child...


Oh. You heard me speak just now.
Do you think Queen Lumera would approve 
of my presence?
I see.
Yes...I believe you.


I just realized something.
That you allowed me into this room right 
from the very beginning.
It shows you have trusted me...
all this time.

I have come to wake you, my partner.


When I'm here...
I know what it is to think dearly of someone. 
Something I thought I would never experience.
Of course, Lady Veyle remains my liege...
but my partner, the one who truly lives in my 
heart, is you and only you.
When I look upon you as you lie on this altar...
I swear upon this ring that I will protect you 
until my last breath.


Oh, you are awake.
You say I should not be so humble, but...
Allow me to be forward with you just this once.
I speak plainly, not to the Divine Dragon, 
but to someone precious to me.


Good morning.
I will protect you today as always.
My loyalty has been given to my lady...
but my heart is yours alone.

I no longer feel awkward...
when I enter this room.


Now it is time to wake up. Heh, when we are 
here, together like this...
I can almost forget that we are in the middle 
of a war.
When peace returns again...
I wonder if I will have the chance to live with 
you, Divine One.
It is an innocent dream for someone such as 
myself, but...
You taught me to believe in impossible ideas.


Good morning.
I feel so close to you...
Especially this morning.
I adore you, Divine One.
Once, that would have been embarrassing for 
me to say aloud.


It is so gratifying...
to be here when you wake, as your first sight 
each day.
I am so happy, Divine One. Thank you...
for helping me learn I could feel this way.
