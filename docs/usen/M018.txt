=== Chapter 18 The Cold Voyage ===

(Route to Elusia)
Having learned the truth about
Veyle, the party heads to Elusia,
where the Fell Dragon waits.

--- OP ---




[Sombron]
Veyle gave the Ring of the Holy Knight to the
Divine Dragon...
[Zephia]
Apologies, my lord.
[Sombron]
The Ring of Azure Twins lost as well. Twice my
Four Hounds failed me.
You do understand the gravity of all this.
[Zephia]
Yes.
[Sombron]
And Veyle?
[Zephia]
Still in a deep slumber.
No matter how much I amplify her draconic
impulses, she won't awaken.
[Sombron]
She refuses her true nature... In that case,
take this.
[Zephia]
Ah... What is it?
[Sombron]
An enchanted helmet. It will strengthen the
spell you cast on her.
My power, with your spell, will correct what is
wrong with Veyle.
[Zephia]
I see.
[Sombron]
Keep it safe. Use it when the time is right.
[Zephia]
Of course. As you will it.
There is...something else I would like to discuss.
[Sombron]
What?
[Zephia]
Pardon me, Lord Sombron, but... Lady Veyle is
your only child, correct?
[Sombron]
My only living child.
[Zephia]
Yes.
[Sombron]
That is correct.
[Zephia]
Of course. I was speaking from fear, not fact.
Forgive me.
[Sombron]
Why ask such a thing?
[Zephia]
Veyle believes one of her siblings is alive.
I thought it best to raise with you.
She spoke of an unbroken dragonstone.
[Sombron]
Hmm.
[Zephia]
But she must be mistaken. We both know
the truth.
Your children were killed in the war a thousand
years ago. All but Veyle.
I remember one who stood above the rest,
with hair and eyes like fire.
What was the name again? Something like...
[Sombron]
Zephia.
[Zephia]
My lord.
[Sombron]
I do not remember all my children's names
or faces. But that one I killed myself.
[Zephia]
Yes.
[Sombron]
Moments later, I was imprisoned. Did you
collect the body?
[Zephia]
I... I did not.
[Sombron]
Then I rescind what I said.
[Zephia]
...
[Sombron]
The answer is no.
And if you find that offspring...bring me a
corpse this time.
[Zephia]
Yes, Lord Sombron. As you wish.




[Alear]
Thanks for arranging this ship for us, Alfred.
[Alfred]
Thank my mother, not me.
When I said we were headed to Elusia, she got
one of the fleet's finest lined up.
[Alear]
How was everything at the capital?
[Alfred]
Well enough. There haven't been any attacks
since we left for Brodia.
[Alear]
What a relief.
[Alfred]
I told Mother what the other side's been up to.
How they're after "sovereign blood."
She was shocked, of course, to hear about
King Morion and King Hyacinth.
[Alear]
Understandably so.
[Alfred]
As for the destruction at Florra Port, the royal
family will spare no expense on aid.
Though it may be years before the harbor is
returned to its original beauty.
[Alear]
We must defeat the Fell Dragon so that such
horrors never happen again.
[Diamant]
What's our plan? When we arrive, do we head
straight for Elusia Castle?
[Alear]
First, we should try to learn what we can from
the Elusian people.
Rings or no rings, if we don't know what we're
up against, we could lose everything.
Besides...there's something I need to find out.
[Diamant]
And what's that?
[Alear]
Whether Veyle is all right.
[Diamant]
Hm. From our vantage, the Hounds certainly
didn't seem pleased.
[Diamant]

[Ivy]
They may attempt to erase her personality.
If anyone can do it, that woman can.
[Alear]
I know Veyle killed my mother. Nothing we've
learned changes that.
But I can't help but worry about her. I hope
she's not hurt.
[Alfred]
Yes, I suppose she's a victim in this too. And
she did risk her neck to give us the ring.
[Alfred]



[Timerra]
Or it was all an act, and she's just gaining our
trust to stab us in the back. Again.
[Ivy]
[Diamant]
That's worth considering. We don't know
enough to rule anything out.
[Alear]
Still...I want to trust her.

[Vander]
Divine One, excuse me. Two ships flying
Elusian colors approach from ahead.
[Alear]
Any sign of the Hounds?
[Vander]
None. However...it appears the enemy intends
to attack us.
[Alear]
Then we've got no choice but to fight them on
the water. Prepare for battle, everyone!

[Lindon] Die

[Lindon]
Since the king's death, my country has become
something unrecognizable.
Elusia's armies serve Elusia no longer, but the
Hounds... Is this truly what I'm meant to do?

[Alfred]
We're fighting on two fronts.
Good news is, the ship's got flame cannons
that'll set fires and slow down the enemy.
Be careful, though. Wouldn't want our allies to
get caught in the blaze.

[Alear]
Elusia is in sight.
[Ivy]
So...I've returned.
[Alear]
Are you all right?
[Ivy]
Whatever has become of Elusia, I'll still do what
I must.
Givre Port is a little farther north. I suggest
sailing there.
[Alear]
Understood.
[Ivy]
It's near the castle and the cathedral, so we
should be able to gather intel there.
I will inform the others of our destination.
[Ivy]
[Hortensia]

[Alear]
...
Marth, Celica, Micaiah, Roy... We've returned
without you.
But we'll get you back this time. Just hang on.




[Sigurd]
Elusia...
A return, then, to the land where we were
separated from our fellow Emblems.
[Lucina]
If reunited, we can at last grant the power we
offer once every thousand years.
[Sigurd]
We should discuss our...other option. That is,
the far greater power only we know about.
[Lucina]



[Eirika]
Yes, of course. The miracle. We could use that
power at long last. I would suggest...Lumera.
[Sigurd]

[Ike]
I don't like this idea.
We shouldn't perform the miracle. We have
to think of the future.
[Eirika]


[Lyn]
I agree. The whole future. We can't favor
anyone with it now.
[Ike]

[Leif]
Favor someone? We're talking about Lumera.
We can prevent a tragedy.
[Lyn]

[Corrin]
Please, those of us who were scattered in other
lands are still learning all that's happened.
[Corrin]

[Byleth]
Some of us were at her castle. Some were not.
It's natural to see things differently.
So, we are not all in agreement. At least,
at present.
[Leif]

[Lucina]
Using our power every thousand years is one
thing. The miracle, we've never used it before.
Never in all of existence...
[Byleth]


[Sigurd]
The cost of doing so is not small. Perhaps we
should never, ever use it.
Hmm...
Of course, we are not all here. What might the
others think? What might they decide?

[Thief]
Hehehe, they're nice and distracted. Don't mind
me, chumpsâ”€I'm just here for the treasure!

[Lindon]
Death does not frighten me. I know my wife
awaits me on the other side.

" [Elusian Soldier] * [Elusian Soldier] [Elusian Soldier] [Boss]
I have my orders. You will not survive
this battle.

" [Elusian Soldier] 0 [Elusian Soldier] [Elusian Soldier] [Boss]
You betrayed us!

[Lindon]
I fight to restore Elusia. You fight for its decline.
Which of us is truly on the wrong side?

" [Elusian Soldier] ( [Elusian Soldier] [Elusian Soldier] [Boss]
I deserve...no less...


--- DIE ---


[Lindon]
Perhaps my fighting years are behind me.
Time to retreat.


[Lindon]
This life was more than enough... My love...
I am on my way...
