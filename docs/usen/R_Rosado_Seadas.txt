=== Rosado & Seadall ===
--- C ---



[Seadall]
Hmm...
[Rosado]
You can look. I don't mind.
[Seadall]
Uh, what?
[Rosado]
You've kinda been staring at me. It's OK. I know
I'm adorable.
[Rosado]
You were admiring my cuteness, right?
Admire away.
[Seadall]
Oh, well, I suppose you're not wrong.
[Seadall]
I do appreciate the way you take care of
yourself and your appearance.
[Seadall]
Your hair is so shiny, it practically glows.
And your skin...it's the picture of health.
[Seadall]
I'm dying to know what your beauty secret is.
[Rosado]
Haha! Aw, thanks so much!
[Rosado]
I don't have any beauty secrets, though.
[Seadall]
That's...not possible.
[Seadall]
You have to be doing something. Watching what
you eat, exercising vigorously─something.
[Seadall]
It's not possible to look like...you...without
putting in some kind of effort.
[Seadall]
If you're telling the truth, it's just not fair.
I put a lot of work into being...me.
[Rosado]
I don't know what to tell you. I really don't do
anything special.
[Seadall]
Please.
[Seadall]
Maybe it's something you're not aware of...or
maybe you're just keeping your secret from me.
[Seadall]
Either way, I'm going to figure it out. As a
dancer, my craft demands it.

[Rosado]
Zzz... zzz...
[Seadall]
All right, then. Rosado is taking a nap.
[Rosado]
...Mmm...cute...
[Seadall]
He must have some kind of secret beauty
regimen. I mean, just look at him.
[Seadall]
Though, I have been keeping an eye on him
and I still can't figure out what it could be.
[Rosado]
...Mmm...hehe... Mmm...
[Seadall]
Ugh, what a terrible position to sleep in.
Absolutely awful for one's posture.
[Seadall]
Hmm... Sleep is supposed to be good for the
skin. But that can't be it. Everyone sleeps.
[Seadall]
I must remain patient─he's bound to do
something interesting soon.

[Rosado]
I feel great this morning!
[Seadall]
So, he just woke up and now he's washing his
face. I'll finally learn his secret.
[Seadall]
With skin that dewy, he must be using a
special moisturizer.
[Seadall]
What could it be? I have to know.
[Rosado]
♪Hmm-hmm!♪
[Seadall]
How strange. No moisturizer...at all.
[Seadall]
He washed his face and then just moved right
on to washing his hair.
[Seadall]
And he's not even using shampoo.
[Rosado]
Nice and refreshed! Now, time to find
some breakfast.
[Seadall]
What? No oil-infused conditioner or scented
styling cream? He─ He didn't even dry it!
[Seadall]
Is this really happening? Does Rosado truly
have no special beauty routine?
[Seadall]
No... I bet it has something to do with what he
eats. Surely that's his beauty trick.
[Seadall]
I will not give up until I figure this out. If Rosado
can look that...incredible...so can I.

[Rosado]
...
[Rosado]
The roast chicken's delicious today. Want
some, Seadall?
[Seadall]
O spirit of the cards! Cast your divine light and
reveal Rosado's beauty secret to me...
[Seadall]
No one can be that beautiful and not have
a trick up their sleeve!
[Seadall]
He...he lives as he pleases, and he eats as
he pleases!
[Seadall]
And here I am, being so particular for the sake
of my dancing─foregoing flavor.
[Seadall]
Spirit of the cards, are you really and truly and
totally certain he does nothing at all special?!
[Rosado]
Hahah! Have you been studying my routine?
[Rosado]
If so, you shouldn't need to ask─you've already
seen that I don't do anything special.
[Seadall]
I suppose you're right.
[Seadall]
Rosado, it's just incredible that you do nothing
at all and yet always look so...good.
[Rosado]
And no need to be jealous of me. You can live
however you want too.
[Seadall]
That's the secret─living however I want?
[Seadall]
Hm. Is avoiding the sorts of food I truly like
actually taking a toll on my dancing?
[Seadall]
Perhaps the secret to looking and feeling great
is just...living a life guided by one's desires.
[Seadall]
All my focus on flavorlessness is taking the
flavor out of my artistry!
[Seadall]
That's it! It has to be! Rosado's way of life
proves it!
[Seadall]
All right, then, I'm not going to deny myself
the things I love anymore!
[Seadall]
I'll eat roast chicken dipped in all kinds of honey
sauce. Sweet! Spicy! Extra-sweet! Extra-spicy!
[Seadall]
From here on out, I'm going to eat whatever my
heart desires and sleep whenever I want!
[Rosado]
Hope he doesn't overdo it. Too much of
anything is no good for you.
[Rosado]
Ah, well...
[Rosado]
No harm letting him indulge himself a while.
The important thing right now is he's happy.
[Rosado]
He'll figure out the rest as he goes!
