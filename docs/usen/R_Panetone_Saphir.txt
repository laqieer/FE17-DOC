=== Panette & Saphir ===
--- C ---


[Saphir]
Phew! Another glorious sweat. That smell's
how you know the training's done.
[Saphir]
Right. Next, a bath, then chow.


[Panette]
Saphir, pardon me, but we simply must do
something about that vulgar tongue of yours.
[Saphir]
Uh, hey, Panette. What's all that, now?
[Panette]
Though we hail from different countries, we are
both employed in the service of royals.
[Panette]
In our position, one must act─and speak─
unimpeachably. At all times.
[Saphir]
Unimpeachably, huh?
[Saphir]
Well, I've talked this way my whole life. Feels
like I'd remember it being a problem.
[Panette]
Oh, but don't you see? A knight's bearing
speaks to the bearing of her nation.
[Panette]
If she makes even the smallest misstep, it may
linger as a national mark of shame!
[Saphir]
Is that right...
[Saphir]
So you're saying if I act how I please, folks'll get
the wrong idea about my whole kingdom.
[Panette]
Precisely so. I am glad you appreciate the
gravity of the situation.
[Panette]
But never fear, dearest Saphir!
[Panette]
I shall give you a master class in proper speech
and manners!
[Saphir]
Uh, OK? Is that...good?
[Panette]
Indeed! I will begin planning. Prepare to learn
like your life depends on it!

[Saphir]
...
[Saphir]
How much longer...do I gotta do this
kneeling crap?
[Panette]
Ah-ah-ah! Language. Try again.
[Saphir]
At what length...did my lady say...I'm to
continue...this kneeling crap?
[Panette]
Only one hour longer.
[Panette]
Any courtier worth her salt must be able to
kneel for at least that time.
[Saphir]
An hour?! Uh... An hour, you say? Indeed?
[Saphir]
That's fine... Only my back's on fire now.
Legs went numb ages ago...
[Saphir]
Urgh...
[Saphir]
AUGH! Forget it! I'm done!
[Saphir]
Only combat's allowed to be this exhausting!
[Saphir]
Sorry, but I'm gonna call it here. This stuff isn't
for me.
[Saphir]
My kingdom'll have to make do with my
strength. They're not getting manners.
[Panette]
Tsk, tsk, tsk! If it tests your endurance, then it
must be useful training, no?
[Panette]
Here I thought you were made of sterner stuff.
[Saphir]
C'mon...
[Panette]
The Saphir I know would never throw in the
towel midway through training.
[Panette]
Perhaps I had you mixed up with another, more
tenacious gray-haired beauty. My mistake.
[Saphir]
Oh, fine!
[Saphir]
You made your point! I'll keep going!
[Saphir]
No way am I gonna quit after you bring
training into it like that.
[Panette]
Good! I would expect nothing less.
[Saphir]
Let it never be said that I didn't fight to the
bitter end.
[Saphir]
I'm gonna get so prim and proper so fast
it's gonna make your head spin!

[Saphir]
Hm.
[Panette]
Astounding! Two entire hours of kneeling.
Easily your personal best.
[Saphir]
Is that so? For one such as myself, this interval
of kneeling is hardly an exertion at all.
[Panette]
Your speech, too, is flawless.
[Panette]
I never expected you to make so much progress
in so little time.
[Panette]
Impressive work, Saphir. I count myself quite
proud indeed.
[Saphir]
You are gracious to bestow upon me such lavish
praise. I am truly flattered.
[Saphir]
And glad to have figured all that stuff out, so
I can finally go back to talkin' like normal!
[Panette]
What?!
[Panette]
But why? We have hardly scratched
the surface!
[Saphir]
Listen, I get that manners are important now.
But I only needed a handle on the basics.
[Saphir]
Now that I've got it, I can focus on serving
my kingdom in the way I'm best suited.
[Panette]
Hm... I suppose that makes a kind of sense.
[Saphir]
You've taught me something valuable. Trust me,
I'm not gonna throw it away.
[Saphir]
I'll make an even better knight now that I know
how not to be an embarrassment.
[Panette]
Haha! Well, it seems my lofty estimation of you
was exactly on point.
[Panette]
Perhaps I ought to follow your example. You
know, spend more time training my body.
[Saphir]
I'd be happy to give you a few pointers,
if you're interested. Fair's fair.
[Panette]
Truly?!
[Panette]
Imagine my manners, combined with a well-knit
physique like yours... I would be flawless!
[Panette]
All right, Saphir. You have yourself a bargain.
[Saphir]
Wondrous, m'lady! Do be certain to prepare
yourself well, however. We're gonna go hard.
[Panette]
Why, of course! I will become so strong that
even you kneel at my feet, so to speak.
