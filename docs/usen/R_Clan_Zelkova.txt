[Zelkov] 
At last, Clanne... I have *tracked* you down.
[Clanne] 
Ahh!
[Clanne] 
Y-y-you frightened me! ...Um, you're 
Zelkov, right?
[Zelkov] 
Indeed. Interesting... Has something in particular 
about me *frightened* you?
[Clanne] 
Uh, mostly your face, I guess...
[Zelkov] 
You mean to say I have an unsettling *visage*?
[Clanne] 
Uh, um, I mean... Did you need me for 
something?
[Zelkov] 
Yes. I am going to ask you a question. You will 
provide your answer *immediately.*
[Clanne] 
Eep!
[Clanne] 
Did...did I...do something?
[Zelkov] 
Not yet. But that is about to *change.*
[Clanne] 
Wh-what do you mean?
[Zelkov] 
I have a problem that can only be resolved by 
your *particular* skills.
[Clanne] 
What skills? I-I don't have any skills...at 
crime stuff.
[Zelkov] 
What was that? Speak up. Allow your voice to 
carve through the silence like a *knife.*
[Zelkov] 
Otherwise I may begin to feel you lack the 
*conviction* to assist me.
[Clanne] 
No, no, no! It's fineâ”€totally fine! Haha! 
Happy to help!
[Clanne] 
Just...please stop making that scary face.
[Zelkov] 
Excellent. Thank you. Now, please keep this 
discussion *solely* between us.

[Clanne] 
Ooh gosh... Ooh geez... What kind of horrible 
thing is he going to make me do?
[Clanne] 
What if he wants me to be an accomplice to 
a crime? I can't do it. I can't accomple!
[Zelkov] 
The moment is upon us, Clanne. You must 
instruct me in the art of *pickles.*
[Clanne] 
Huh?
[Zelkov] 
*Pickles,* Clanne. I must learn them. You must 
teach them to me.
[Zelkov] 
Whispers abound that your prowess in the way 
of *pickles* is unmatched. Is this not so?
[Clanne] 
No, that's true. I do really like making pickles.
[Clanne] 
So the skill I have that you need...is pickling?
[Clanne] 
Hah, that's a relief! I thought you were going to 
ask me to do something...I don't know, sinister.
[Zelkov] 
I assure you, my *pickle* aspirations are 
not nefarious.
[Zelkov] 
Now dispense with the *japes* if you would be 
so kind. This is a serious matter.
[Zelkov] 
I have recently taken up a *pursuit* of the 
culinary arts.
[Clanne] 
Oh, you started cooking? That's nice! I think 
that's wonderful.
[Zelkov] 
I have mastered numerous dishes. But a certain 
sauce with minced *pickles* eludes my grasp.
[Zelkov] 
My technique requires *refinement.*
[Clanne] 
Couldn't you just, um, buy some pickles from 
the market?
[Zelkov] 
And soar to greatness on stolen wings? 
Absolutely not. The *pickles* will be mine.
[Clanne] 
Ahh... And that's where I come in.
[Clanne] 
OK, sure. I'd be happy to teach you anything 
you want to know about making pickles.
[Zelkov] 
*Marvelous.*
[Clanne] 
So, since I'm teaching you, I trust you'll be 
a good pupil?
[Zelkov] 
Of course. The fate of my *sauce* is at stake.

[Zelkov] 
Urg...
[Clanne] 
Zelkov? What's wrong? You're making that 
scary face again.
[Clanne] 
Uh-oh, did the sauce not turn out well?
[Zelkov] 
...
[Clanne] 
I...I guess not. Sorry to hear that. I wish I could 
have done more to help.
[Zelkov] 
*Taste* it.
[Clanne] 
Huh? But I thought it didn't turn out...
[Zelkov] 
*Taste* it.
[Clanne] 
OK...
[Clanne] 
Well, um, let's see here... Uh...
[Clanne] 
Wait, what?! This is delicious!
[Clanne] 
The pickles are sweet and sour in perfect 
balance. This sauce is amazing!
[Zelkov] 
*Indeed.*
[Clanne] 
So, why do you look so upset? You mastered 
the sauce, right?
[Zelkov] 
Yes. The *sauce* is perfect. But now there is an 
even greater struggle.
[Zelkov] 
I do not know a dish that is *worthy* of it.
[Clanne] 
Oooh. That's why you look scary.
[Zelkov] 
I was certain the sauce would be my *triumph.* 
Only now do I see the depths of my foolishness.
[Clanne] 
I think my pickles go with everything, but the 
best pairing would probably be with red meat.
[Zelkov] 
*Meat,* you say?
[Clanne] 
Waaah! You're doing the scary face again!
[Zelkov] 
You are a savant, Clanne. A culinary *genius.* 
I find myself once again in your debt.
[Zelkov] 
If there exists a meat dish *worthy* of this sauce 
then you and I shall taste it.
[Clanne] 
Y-yeah, um...sure. OK. I'm starting to get used 
to that face, anyway.
[Clanne] 
I'll accompany you to the very end of this 
journey, as we make *delicious food* together!
