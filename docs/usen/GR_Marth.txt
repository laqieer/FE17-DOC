=== Marth & Alfred ===

--- C ---



[Alfred]
That's the ring the Divine One wore in their
sleep. What an honor to serve with you.
[Marth]
I am glad to fight beside such a worthy prince.
Together, may we bring about peace.

--- B ---



[Marth]
You look troubled, Alfred. Is there something
weighing on you?
[Alfred]
I was feeling down about how scrawny I still
am. Maybe I'll go for a jog. That usually helps.

--- A ---



[Marth]
You have a true passion for exercise. I applaud
your dedication.
[Alfred]
I was a sickly kid, so I used to do it to toughen
up. It's grown into a hobby by now.
[Marth]
Illness can lay low even the hardiest knight.
You have done well to compensate for it.
[Alfred]
I train hard, that's all. Speaking of which, I'm
going for a run. Wanna join me?

=== Marth & Anna ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
I worried how you would fare in combat, but
you have proven to be a staunch ally, Anna.
[Anna]
I got pretty good with an axe from all the wood
I used to chop. And that's Lady Anna to you!

--- B ---



[Anna]
You should stop by my village when the fighting
is over! We'll throw a big ol' party for you!
[Marth]
I would enjoy seeing where you hail from.
I have heard each day there is a festival.

--- A ---



[Anna]
Good news! Today is now officially "Marth-Anna
Friendship Day"!
[Marth]
An occasion worth marking. But why declare
it a holiday all its own?
[Anna]
Because that means there's gotta be a party!
Also, it'll help make sure I never forget you!
[Marth]
Well, I am honored to be celebrated. But I would
remember you fondly even without a holiday.

=== Marth & Bunet ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
I am told you cook the most delicious dishes.
You are a chef and a knight? Truly impressive.
[Bunet]
Cooking is my passion. Perhaps you will teach
me a recipe from your own world one day?

--- B ---



[Bunet]
Emblems are incapable of eating, I'm told. It
saddens me to know I can't treat you to a meal.
[Marth]
Not to worry, Bunet. Watching everyone enjoy
your cooking will be pleasure enough for me.

--- A ---



[Marth]
You are trying to rebuild your parents'
restaurant, I hear. It was destroyed by bandits?
[Bunet]
Yes. It was a terrible time for me. But my dear
friend Fogado...he saved me.
[Bunet]
He made me his personal chef and his knight.
I owe my whole life to the prince.
[Marth]
So, the two of you are bound together by food
and friendship. Beautiful bonds indeed.

=== Marth & Boucheron ===

--- C ---




[Boucheron]
It's an honor to stand beside you in battle.
I've got a lot to live up to as a royal soldier.
[Marth]
We must all rise to meet our own challenges,
Boucheron. Let us do so together.

--- B ---



[Marth]
Do your eyes fill with tears, Boucheron?
Has something tragic happened?
[Boucheron]
No... I've been reading a tragedy, not living one.
Every time I think about it, the tears gush.

--- A ---




[Boucheron]
This war has ravaged the land and polluted the
waters. It needs to stop, and soon.
[Marth]
Your hometown is a good village, I hear, with
greenery everywhere. Clear water too, I expect.
[Boucheron]
Yes. The rivers there are like crystal. I'd often
go there to fish. I wonder if they still sparkle...
[Marth]
Draw strength from your love of the land.
Combine it with ours as we work to bring peace.

=== Marth & Céline ===

--- C ---




[Céline]
Never did I dream that I would meet an Emblem
in person. There is so much I want to discuss.
[Marth]
I would be delighted to hear stories of the
kingdom of Firene─and of yourself.

--- B ---




[Céline]
That's a lovely circlet you wear. It complements
your attire...and clearly has sentimental value.
[Marth]
Well spotted. It is very precious, gifted as it was
by someone dear to me.

--- A ---




[Céline]
I love my kingdom and its people, which is why
I have resolved to fight on their behalf.
[Marth]
I know all too well that there are things in this
world worth taking up arms to defend.
[Céline]
Thank you. It's good to know others feel as I do.
I breathe easier fighting with one of like mind.
[Marth]
I shall fight by your side as long as you will
have me─until the day your kingdom is safe.

=== Marth & Chloé ===

--- C ---



[Chloé]
Talking to the Emblem who watched over the
Divine One makes me feel like I'm in a fairy tale.
[Marth]
I enjoy our chats. Being around a pegasus knight
always reminds me of someone very dear to me.

--- B ---



[Chloé]
There's nothing wrong with resting now and
then. Why not take it easy for the next battle?
[Marth]
I agree, and you should do the same. I want to
see this war through without losing anyone.

--- A ---



[Chloé]
Until I met Princess Céline, I knew nothing of
the world. I never thought it could be so vast.
[Marth]
So many work tirelessly just to survive. Think of
them as you fight.
[Chloé]
I'll try as hard as I must to keep them safe.
Is that the secret to it, Marth?
[Marth]
It is. Together with our allies that we have
grown so close to, we shall bring about peace.

=== Marth & Citrinne ===

--- C ---




[Citrinne]
Thank you for lending us your strength, Marth.
I'll do everything I can to repay your kindness.
[Marth]
It is clear that you love your kingdom, Citrinne.
We shall fight together until peace is restored.

--- B ---




[Citrinne]
Marth...do you think I'm useful in battle? I know
that my magic needs a fair amount of work...
[Marth]
You do very well out there, Citrinne, and you
grow stronger with each day. I have faith in you.

--- A ---



[Marth]
Alcryst places much trust in you. There is a
familial closeness there, if I'm not mistaken.
[Citrinne]
Alcryst and I are cousins! We grew up around
each other, so we're quite comfortable together.
[Citrinne]
The same goes for Diamant. I don't see a crown
prince or a flawless warrior...I just see Diamant.
[Marth]
Relationships built on time and trust. Wonderful.
I hope we can claim the same someday.

=== Marth & Clanne ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
I watched you perform in battle. You are quite
skilled. I am glad to be working with you.
[Clanne]
Oh, wow. You think I'm good? That's a real
honor. I promise to try and live up to it!

--- B ---



[Clanne]
Lord Marth, do you have anyone you admire?
Like, someone you look at and think, "wow"?
[Marth]
I admire all my friends that I form strong
bonds with. Like you, Clanne.

--- A ---



[Clanne]
I figured out why you're called the Hero-King.
You're super powerful and don't need anyone.
[Marth]
Not at all. I was powerless on my own. I only
succeeded with the help of others.
[Marth]
My life belonged to my friends and their own to
me. I fought for them, and they called me hero.
[Clanne]
So, power is earned and not given? Thanks for
teaching me that, Lord Marth.

=== Marth & Diamant ===

--- C ---



[Diamant]
It's an honor to fight beside such a mighty hero.
I'm glad to have you with us, Marth.
[Marth]
I feel the same way, Diamant. Let us stand
together in the name of peace.

--- B ---



[Diamant]
I won't rule the same way my father did. I want
Brodia to prosper, but not through warfare.
[Marth]
Important considerations for any heir. Of course
you will do what is best for your kingdom.

--- A ---



[Diamant]
Do you struggle with any specific skills, Marth?
Between you and me...magic intimidates me.
[Marth]
The crown prince of Brodia is not as flawless
as rumored? Is there a story behind this?
[Diamant]
When I was young...I set off an explosion during
a magic lesson. I've feared it ever since.
[Marth]
Where you struggle, rely on your friends. I did,
and so was also known as the Rallying Hero.

=== Marth & Etie ===

--- C ---




[Etie]
Heya, Marth. You caught me in my favorite
mood─just after a good, hard workout!
[Marth]
Your diligence in training with the bow might
put you on par with Altea's finest archer.

--- B ---




[Etie]
Hey, Marth. I was just about to have some tea
if you want to join me.
[Marth]
I cannot sip tea with you, but I can discern the
smell. I'm content to appreciate that if you are.

--- A ---




[Etie]
Wish these thoughts would stop buzzing in my
head. Only one thing to do about that.
[Marth]
Are you troubled by doubts, Etie?
[Marth]
You may feel better talking about it. A fear
shared is often a fear dispelled.
[Etie]
I appreciate it, but nothing works for me like
exercise. I'm gonna out-jog these doubts!

=== Marth & Fogado ===

--- C ---




[Fogado]
All this fighting is exhausting. What we need
is a big ol' feast to liven things up, right?
[Marth]
A feast can be a good way to inspire people.
And while I cannot eat, I can socialize.

--- B ---



[Marth]
You and your sister are quite close, aren't you?
You trust each other even when you're apart.
[Fogado]
Yeah, my family is a tight-knit bunch. No matter
where we are, our hearts are always connected.

--- A ---



[Marth]
I hear Timerra went camping all across the
queendom. Have you traveled like that as well?
[Fogado]
I've hit the road plenty as a Sentinel. Many
people I meet say I look just like the prince.
[Fogado]
See, most folks only know the royal family from
our portraits. They don't realize I am the prince.
[Marth]
Ah, and you still have not corrected them. You
are a very unusual prince indeed, Fogado.

=== Marth & Framme ===

--- C ---



[Framme]
I'm sooo honored I get to fight beside you,
Emblem Marth. I'll try not to hold you back.
[Marth]
You have nothing to worry about, Framme.
Together we will bring this battle to an end.

--- B ---



[Marth]
You look rather pleased, Framme. What are you
doing there?
[Framme]
Oh, I'm just writing a letter to my family. They
live far away, and I want them to know I'm OK.

--- A ---



[Framme]
Emblem Marth, were you there the whole time...
while the Divine Dragon slept, I mean?
[Marth]
I was there...though time passed quite quickly.
I saw the admirable job you did standing guard.
[Framme]
Thank you! And I'm gonna do an even better job
for you and for the Divine Dragon from now on.
[Marth]
I do not doubt it, Framme. Together, we are
sure to be an unstoppable force.

=== Marth & Goldmary ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
Without the ring you returned, we might very
well be lost. Thank you, Goldmary.
[Goldmary]
I see you know how to give a compliment.
I think we'll get along just fine, Marth.

--- B ---



[Goldmary]
I'm sorry if I completely overshadow you, Marth,
but you're charming in your own right.
[Marth]
No need for concern. This army has many
personalities more charming than my own.

--- A ---



[Goldmary]
This may be hard to fathom now, but I used to
be quite complacent and difficult to motivate.
[Marth]
Indeed that is hard to fathom. How did you
become the Goldmary you are today?
[Goldmary]
I was caught in a battle. War is a cruel but
effective teacher. It made me want to be more.
[Marth]
War came to me in my youth, in much the same
way. It seems we are alike in that regard.

=== Marth & Hortensia ===

--- C ---



[Hortensia]
You're a popular guy, aren't you, Marth?
I've got an eye for this sort of thing.
[Marth]
I suspect not in the way you mean, although
I have been blessed to have many allies.

--- B ---



[Marth]
I admire you staying in Elusia as long as you
did. It was noble of you to help those people.
[Hortensia]
It's what my father would have done. He always
thought of his kingdom first.

--- A ---



[Hortensia]
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to help my sister
put our kingdom back together.
[Marth]
I was forced to flee my war-torn homeland as
well, long ago. I had the same determination.
[Hortensia]
How did it turn out for you? Did you restore
your country's glory?
[Marth]
With the help of those allies I spoke of before.
I believe you shall do the same for Elusia.

=== Marth & Ivy ===

--- C ---




[Ivy]
So much has happened in such a short time.
And there is yet more to be done.
[Marth]
You have been through a great deal. We shall
ensure no one else need endure the same.

--- B ---




[Ivy]
It's strange. Somehow I just feel comfortable
around you─like I can tell you anything.
[Marth]
I am glad to hear that. Anytime you should need
an ear, I shall be there to listen.

--- A ---




[Ivy]
I sometimes wish I had your ability to trust
people unconditionally.
[Marth]
You trust your people, no? You also trusted
your allies enough to bring them those rings.
[Ivy]
That's true. I suppose the time I've spent with
our allies has made me...protective of them.
[Marth]
The bonds we forge with others always make
us stronger.

=== Marth & Jade ===

--- C ---




[Jade]
I represent Prince Diamant... Better be careful.
It's an honor to work with you, Sir Marth.
[Marth]
I look forward to seeing you in action, Jade.
Here's to our future!

--- B ---




[Jade]
You seem to be loved by everyone, Sir Marth.
It's as if your very presence puts others at ease.
[Marth]
They also feel safer with the "Iron Wall" herself
among our ranks. Let us protect them together.

--- A ---




[Jade]
Sir Marth, I hope this isn't rude of me...but may
I model a character in my new novel after you?
[Marth]
I am slightly embarrassed by your request, but,
yes, you may. I look forward to reading it.
[Jade]
Thank you, Sir Marth. I hope you enjoy my
writing. Prince Diamant certainly seems to.
[Marth]
Now that is a reliable review. I am eager to see
what kind of character I become!

=== Marth & Jean ===

--- C ---



[Jean]
It's my dream to be a doctor, just like my father.
People will still get sick even after the war.
[Marth]
I am sure you will be a splendid doctor. I await
the day you can fulfill that dream.

--- B ---



[Jean]
I know I'm not a full-fledged doctor yet, but I'll
find a niche for me here. There's gotta be one.
[Marth]
It astonishes me how deftly you can treat even
serious injuries. We all rely on you, Jean.

--- A ---



[Jean]
Whew... Everyone's pushing themselves so
hard─I can barely keep up with all the injuries.
[Marth]
I understand that it is difficult for you. But you
must rise to meet the challenge, as they do.
[Jean]
That's true. And it's not like I have nothing to
fight for. My home, the tea fields, my friends...
[Marth]
Yours is the grease that keeps our wheel of war
moving onward. We all appreciate your work.

=== Marth & Kagetsu ===

--- C ---



[Kagetsu]
Marth! May our deep bond of friendship outlast
all of time!
[Marth]
Indeed. Let us fight together as friends, from
now until the end.

--- B ---



[Kagetsu]
Tell me of your homeland. I wish to hear
particularly of its greatest fighters!
[Marth]
We had many powerful swordsmen, not unlike
you. The Scarlet Sword comes to mind.

--- A ---



[Kagetsu]
Marth! I have seen your future! Would you like
to know what lies in store?
[Marth]
My future? That is a rather weighty decision,
yet I admit I am curious. What did you see?
[Kagetsu]
You will assume a mighty pose during our next
battle! I assume this means we will win!
[Marth]
A promising prediction indeed. I look forward
to winning this victory with you.

=== Marth & Lapis ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
You have incredible strength, Lapis. Our foes
are fierce...but together, we will reclaim peace.
[Lapis]
I'm not sure how useful I'll be, but I'll try. Let's
wish ourselves luck too. Couldn't hurt, right?

--- B ---



[Marth]
You are so resourceful, Lapis. Your many small
efforts all add up to aid us in winning this war.
[Lapis]
Happy to help! Is there anything I can craft for
you, Marth? Maybe a cute stand for your ring?

--- A ---



[Lapis]
Marth? If you had a dear friend that you might
never see again...how would you handle it?
[Marth]
That would be a terrible situation─wanting to
speak with them, but being unable to do so...
[Marth]
Still, I would think of them often. Any bonds
forged between us would never break.
[Lapis]
Yeah! I think so too! You'd always be connected
to them, no matter what... Thank you, Marth.

=== Marth & Lindon ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
I have been told you are an excellent royal
soldier. I am grateful to have you at my side.
[Lindon]
Every soul here is helping to restore peace to
Elusia, which means I must do my part as well.

--- B ---




[Lindon]
If you need my skills, just let me know. Making
pastries with thunder is a specialty of mine!
[Marth]
What fascinating uses people devise for magic!
Your talents will be in demand, even in peace.

--- A ---



[Marth]
Is that a portrait you gaze upon?
[Lindon]
Yes, it's of my late wife. I always keep it close
wherever I go.
[Lindon]
Isn't she lovely? I'm proud to have given the
best years of my life to this wonderful woman.
[Marth]
As you should be. I cannot see my own beloved
right now, but I still feel her, connected to me.

=== Marth & Louis ===

--- C ---



[Louis]
You're a captivating man, Marth. Your radiance
enriches all who stand in your presence.
[Marth]
Louis, you flatter me. You do your own share
to brighten the mood.

--- B ---



[Louis]
Your interactions with the Divine One are a
unique sight all their own. A fresh new canvas...
[Marth]
A canvas? Apologies, I don't understand what
you mean. Would you mind elaborating?

--- A ---



[Marth]
It has not escaped my notice how considerate
you are. Have you always been this way?
[Louis]
I've aimed to please since I was a child. Perhaps
my large family of brothers was the cause.
[Louis]
I shall always be grateful to my family for that.
It's why I was chosen as a retainer.
[Marth]
Ha, your support on the battlefield puts us all
at ease. You serve us well, Louis.

=== Marth & Alear ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
It is good that we can talk after I spent so long
silently watching over you, .
[Alear]
I know what you mean. I'm really glad to have
you at my side, supporting me in person.

--- B ---




[Alear]
You're just about the strongest person I know,
Marth. How can I be more like you?
[Marth]
You can accomplish great things if you let your
bonds with your friends become your strength.

--- A ---



[Marth]
It makes my heart sing to see how you have
grown. You carry yourself with such confidence.
[Alear]
I'm lucky to have had so many good people to
get me here. I never could have done it alone.
[Alear]
Will you be there with me as we see what the
future holds, Marth?
[Marth]
Of course. Bonds such as ours are the
foundation of the future. They will never fade.

=== Marth & Mauvier ===

--- C ---



[Mauvier]
I am grateful for your allegiance. With you by
my side, I shall atone for my past crimes.
[Marth]
You are a warrior with a righteous heart, and
I am proud to join your cause.

--- B ---



[Mauvier]
I come from the kingdom of Firene. That is
where I learned to treasure those close to me.
[Marth]
Those very feelings are what saved Veyle from
darkness. I am glad you're here.

--- A ---



[Mauvier]
Lady Veyle has been in good spirits of late.
This place is good for her.
[Marth]
Veyle is lucky to have your friendship
and support.
[Mauvier]
We have so many more companions than in
the past, and for that I am very grateful.
[Marth]
The bonds of today pave the path to our future.
We walk that path together, my friend.

=== Marth & Merrin ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
I must say, you fought gallantly in battle, Merrin.
I could hardly take my eyes off you.
[Merrin]
I am pleased to hear you say so, Sir Marth.
I hope I never disappoint you on the battlefield.

--- B ---



[Merrin]
I confess, I never get tired of eating sweets.
Would you care to try one, Sir Marth?
[Marth]
I am sure they are delicious. Alas, I cannot eat.
It is fun to take in their pretty colors though.

--- A ---



[Merrin]
In Solm, women inherit the leadership roles.
One day, I'll be the matriarch of my hometown.
[Marth]
Once peace is restored and that time comes,
will you have to give up being a knight?
[Merrin]
No, I'm pleased to say my princess has given
me leave to continue on in both roles.
[Marth]
She is a wise leader indeed. You are sure to be
the...coolest matriarch that ever lived.

=== Marth & Timerra ===

--- C ---




[Timerra]
Pretty much anything that's fun to do, I like
doing. How 'bout you? What do you do for fun?
[Marth]
I have given it no thought. But learning to have
fun sounds...fun. Perhaps you will teach me?

--- B ---




[Timerra]
Hey, Marth! I wrote a song for you─you know,
a little tune to inspire you. Wanna hear it?
[Marth]
You are too kind. I would love to hear it, though
I wonder if you could sing it...quietly?

--- A ---




[Timerra]
I had so much fun on my camping trip! I met all
kinds of folks, and we partied all night long.
[Marth]
I was surprised to hear you were camping. For a
princess, you have a great deal of freedom.
[Timerra]
Yup, it's been really good for me. That freedom
we all enjoy is why I'm trying to protect Solm.
[Marth]
Well, your travels have made you many friends,
and I am grateful you consider me one of them.

=== Marth & Pandreo ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
So, it was you I heard singing earlier. You have
a beautiful voice. I would love to hear more.
[Pandreo]
Lord Marth! You were listening?! I was singing
a prayer to the Divine Dragon, that's all.

--- B ---




[Pandreo]
The Ring Chamber is kinda dreary, yeah?
I could easily liven it up with a bit of renovating.
[Marth]
What a fine idea. You redesigned your family
church, yes? I hear it has been well received.

--- A ---




[Pandreo]
Never imagined fighting beside a dragon. A life
of worship leads to this? Fate is a funny thing.
[Marth]
Is it fate that guides us? I cannot say for sure,
but it does feel as if fate brought us together.
[Pandreo]
And I am grateful! We must party sometime,
unless that would be disrespectful.
[Marth]
Of course not. I am happy to join any festivities,
especially if I get to hear you sing again.

=== Marth & Panette ===

--- C ---




[Panette]
'Tis a glorious honor to fight by thy side,
Lord Emblem! I shall not fail thee in battle!
[Marth]
No need for formalities. I am an Emblem, yet I
would prefer you consider me an equal.

--- B ---



[Marth]
How did you learn to don makeup in such a
manner? I have never seen anything like it.
[Panette]
I found it in an ancient Solmic text. It is said to
offer magical protection to those who wear it.

--- A ---



[Marth]
I am curious, Panette, how did you become
a retainer to Timerra?
[Panette]
I had left home on unpleasant terms, when I
happened upon my lady. We hit it off at once.
[Panette]
I did not know she was royalty until she asked
me to be her retainer. Imagine my surprise.
[Marth]
Unexpected bonds can change our lives. I hope
ours is a meaningful one for you.

=== Marth & Rosado ===

--- C ---




[Rosado]
Hey, Marth! Can you give me a smile? Perfect.
You're adorable!
[Marth]
I am not sure anyone ever called me that before.
I am flattered though. Thank you.

--- B ---




[Rosado]
Some cute clothes would do you a lot of good.
You'd look great in an outfit like mine.
[Marth]
I appreciate the thought. Wonderful as your
style is, I do not think it is for me.

--- A ---




[Rosado]
I was pretty hopeless in school. Always too
busy messing around to get anything done.
[Marth]
I would never have guessed, considering how
studious you are now. What changed?
[Rosado]
I met Hortensia. Without her to push me along,
I'd never have gotten my act together.
[Marth]
My friends are responsible for my finer qualities
too. Let us be good influences on one another.

=== Marth & Saphir ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
You have been defending Brodia for a long time.
I will be relying on your experience.
[Saphir]
You fight with us now, which means you fight
for Brodia too. Consider me grateful.

--- B ---




[Saphir]
Would you mind sparring with me sometime?
I like to train against the toughest opposition.
[Marth]
Call on me whenever you wish. It would be
my honor.

--- A ---




[Saphir]
I grew up in a fishing village. Peaceful place...
until Elusia came through and killed my family.
[Marth]
I know that pain well. Is that what motivated
you to become a royal soldier?
[Saphir]
No, that was always my dream. Would've rather
had my parents alive to see it, but...here I am.
[Marth]
Your feelings for your family led to our meeting,
and for that I am grateful.

=== Marth & Seadall ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
Thank you for protecting Corrin's ring, Seadall.
I understand you are a famous dancer.
[Seadall]
I admit I have something of a reputation. But the
stars tell me you're quite famous as well, Marth.

--- B ---




[Seadall]
I love visiting places I've never been before. Tell
me, Marth, what's it like where you're from?
[Marth]
Not so different from here, really. It is pretty.
I even had a friend who danced for us like you.

--- A ---




[Seadall]
My dancing is almost as good as my master's
was. And yet, I still don't feel worthy of him.
[Marth]
Your master must have been an incredible
dancer. I can see it in the way you move.
[Seadall]
He gave me so much. But he's joined the stars
in the sky, and I can never give anything back.
[Marth]
Your dancing creates joy all around you, and
surely that can be seen even from the stars.

=== Marth & Alcryst ===

--- C ---




[Alcryst]
Aww, I'm sorry, Lord Marth! Emblems like you
should never have to look upon one like me.
[Marth]
It's...it's all right. Don't speak about yourself
that way. You are among friends.

--- B ---




[Alcryst]
You're so charming, Lord Marth... I wish I had
even a fraction of your charisma.
[Marth]
There is plenty to like about you, Alcryst. I hope
you grow to recognize that.

--- A ---




[Alcryst]
You're really incredible, Lord Marth. I apologize
for being such a disappointment...
[Marth]
Disappointment? Never. You are skilled with a
bow and fighting for your kingdom.
[Alcryst]
But the list ends there. Those are the only
things I can do.
[Marth]
No, Alcryst. Those are not the only things you
can do. They are things that only you can do.

=== Marth & Amber ===

[Amber]
Whoa! I get to fight alongside an Emblem?! I am
so, so glad I became a royal retainer!
[Marth]
You flatter me, Amber. Please, just think of me
as another ally fighting to protect this world.

--- B ---




[Amber]
Say, where were you born, Marth? Is it part of a
legend just like you? I'm really into that stuff!
[Marth]
The history of my kingdom starts with the hero
Anri... I shall tell you his story sometime.

--- A ---



[Marth]
I hear you became a retainer after going against
your family and entering a fighting tournament.
[Amber]
Yeah, I didn't hate living back home...but it was
boring! I had to leave to start my own legend.
[Amber]
After the tourney, Diamant came to speak with
me. He asked me to be his retainer─and I lost it!
[Marth]
So, you realized your dream through sheer force
of will. I think you may be a legend already.

=== Marth & Vander ===

[Vander]
Hero-King Marth, will you stand with me?
In the name of the Divine Dragon?
[Marth]
Happily. We each have a duty to perform, so
let us join forces.

--- B ---




[Vander]
Lord Marth, would you care for an apple? I have
developed quite the taste for them, you see.
[Marth]
I wish I could join you. Alas, I cannot eat. I am
glad it brings you pleasure though.

--- A ---



[Marth]
You are quite skilled with your hands, Vander.
I was unaware you can knit.
[Vander]
I say it's merely a hobby, but I took it up for
its practical uses, as well as for relaxation.
[Vander]
My thinking is, once peace is restored, I shall
engross myself wholly in my knitting.
[Marth]
A good plan. Let us end this war and make the
world a place where you may knit in peace.

=== Marth & Veyle ===

--- C ---




[Veyle]
Thank you, Marth, for fighting beside me.
Especially after what I did before.
[Marth]
Do not apologize. You are a good person.
From now on, we fight together.

--- B ---




[Veyle]
Sometimes I wonder if it's really OK for me to
be here. What if...I'm meant to be alone?
[Marth]
Oh, Veyle, do not ever question your place here.
You are precious to every one of us.

--- A ---




[Veyle]
I finally know what it's like to feel happy, Marth.
For the first time in my life, I feel like I belong.
[Marth]
You have been through so very much. But now,
you are surrounded by allies and friends.
[Veyle]
Thank you for your kind words. I just hope...you
also think of me as a friend.
[Marth]
I do. And our friendship will last forever. You
will never have to be alone again, Veyle.

=== Marth & Yunaka ===

--- C ---



[Marth]
You speak with a most unusual dialect, Yunaka.
Where did you pick it up, exactly?
[Yunaka]
Oh, nowhere. I'm one of a kind! Wanna give it
a try? Say it with me... Zappy!

--- B ---



[Yunaka]
Tell me... Do you think there's such a thing
as a fresh start?
[Marth]
Everyone has the potential to change. All they
need is the determination to make it happen.

--- A ---



[Yunaka]
Say, Marth... What would you do if you found
out I'd done something terrible in the past?
[Marth]
Nothing. It's not my place to judge your past,
Yunaka. I trust the person you are now.
[Yunaka]
You trust me? What'd I ever do to deserve that?
[Marth]
A terrible person would not ask a question like
that so earnestly. That is enough for me.

=== Marth & Zelkov ===

--- C ---




[Zelkov]
My main *pursuit* is to win us victory. For that
purpose, Marth, consider me at your disposal.
[Marth]
That is kind of you, but I will accept no offer
of service. Let us fight together as equals.

--- B ---



[Marth]
You work too hard, Zelkov. A little rest now
and then would do you good.
[Zelkov]
I appreciate the sentiment, but it is unnecessary.
I fear *idleness* more than lack of rest.

--- A ---




[Zelkov]
The loss of my family left me with an emptiness
that not even *revenge* was able to fill.
[Marth]
I know that loss, and the emptiness that follows
it, exceptionally well.
[Zelkov]
Fighting for Princess Ivy gives me *relief.*
Thank you for giving me the strength to do so.
[Marth]
No need to thank me. I only hope that your
feelings of emptiness end with the war.
