Hello!


The weather's great today...
so don't sleep through it!
Let's go! Get that blood flowing!


Morning!
C'mon, open up those eyes.


Rested up, Divine One?
Glad to hear it.


--- C2 ---

Let's make this quick, Divine One. I've got a lot 
to do.


Since I'm waiting anyway...
I'll start my routine now.
Hyah! Ngh! Hyah! Ngh!


Ah... Oh, hey!
Didn't see you wake up.
Fine morning, isn't it?


Great, you're up. So, are we done here?
If that's all you need, I'm gonna go for my run.


--- B1 ---

Here I am to get you up and moving.


What's the best way to do this?
I'd give you a nudge, but...
that just feels rude. I'll nudge the altar you're 
sleeping on instead. Ugh!


Nope! No good!
Why's that thing so heavy, Divine One?
I'd better train harder for next time.


You woke up right away.
Are you actually a light sleeper, Divine One?


--- B2 ---

Phew! That's a hundred laps around 
the Somniel!


You know...
I'm even more into running now.
I've left all those pesky lingering doubts in 
the dust.


Morning.
Feeling groggy?
There's no better cure for that than a run. 
What do you say?


You got right up.
That mean you wanna run too?
I could handle some more laps.

OK... Let's do this nice and quiet.
Easy does it.


I brought you my favorite Firenese flower.
No nicer smell in the world.
This should be good to wake up to.


Good morning.
How'd you like the scent of Firene?
Someday I'll take you to a whole field full 
of those beauties.


You're already up?!
I thought for sure...
I was lighter on my feet than that!


--- A2 ---

I made breakfast for you, Divine One!


Have you been using the muscle balm?
It comes in different scents!
There's peach, cookie, and tons of different 
herbs. There's even one that smells like tea.


I think you should try...
the spicy pepper scent.
It'll pep you right up...
so it's perfect for mornings.


Looks like food's the key to getting you up fast.
Well, feast your eyes! I made sure there was 
plenty of protein.

Hey! Your partner's here to wake you!


I've been wanting to show you Firene's 
gorgeous flower fields...
but there's not a lot of time for sightseeing 
with the war and all.
I could have flowers delivered here.
But even if I filled the room with them, it 
wouldn't be the same.
Someday, though...
we'll see those fields together. Promise.


In the meantime, I'll press one of my favorite 
flowers for you.
Maybe I'll pin it, too, so you can wear it. I think 
that'd look nice.


Aw, you're already up? What a shame.
I had something really nice all planned out.
Hah, of course I know how to be nice!

Time for our morning run!
Wake up, sleepyhead.


I took a few laps on my own before I came here.
Sort of like you were doing for a while.
Running alone is fine and all, but it's starting to 
feel wrong to go without you.
I'm just so much stronger when I have my friend 
and partner with me.


Morning! Ready to get moving?
All's right with the world...
when we're running side by side.


Good, you're awake. Ready to go?
Let's start with some stretches...
and a few warm-up laps. Then we'll pick up 
the pace.
