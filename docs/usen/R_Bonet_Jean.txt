[Jean] 
Wow, that's pretty swollen. This is definitely 
some sort of insect sting.
[Bunet] 
Well, I tend plants on the side. Probably got 
stung while I was in the garden.
[Jean] 
I can give you some herbs to reduce the 
swelling. Take care not to touch the wound.
[Bunet] 
I'm sure there's no need for that. Save your 
herbs for someone who could really use them.
[Jean] 
It doesn't work like that.
[Jean] 
We don't know what kind of insect stung you. 
If you leave it untreated, it might get serious.
[Bunet] 
I see... Forgive me. I suppose you would be 
more knowledgeable about such things.
[Jean] 
It's all right. Now you know. Just let me apply 
the dressing like so, and...
[Jean] 
All done. Nothing to worry about now. Just 
leave it be, even if it starts to itch.
[Bunet] 
Understood. I'll try not to touch it.
[Bunet] 
Please, take this. A small token of thanks.
[Jean] 
Wow... What's this pretty flower?
[Bunet] 
Some chamomile from my garden. It has a nice, 
soothing aroma, don't you think?
[Jean] 
Thank you. I appreciate it.
[Bunet] 
You ought to come visit my garden sometime. 
I think you'd like it there.

[Jean] 
How's that insect sting healing, Bunet?
[Bunet] 
The swelling has stopped. All thanks to those 
herbs of yours, no doubt.
[Bunet] 
Somehow, I resisted the urge to taste them.
[Jean] 
Hahaha, a good patient is patient.
[Jean] 
Everything looks fine where you were stung. 
That's a relief.
[Bunet] 
Thank you, Jean.
[Jean] 
Oh, this reminds me. I wanted to ask you 
about something.
[Bunet] 
What's that?
[Jean] 
Remember the chamomile you gave me? 
I looked into it, and it has medicinal uses.
[Jean] 
It's a painkiller and can sometimes reduce 
inflammation. Do you maybe have more?
[Bunet] 
Interesting.
[Bunet] 
Well, there's not much of it, but what I do have, 
I will gladly give you.
[Jean] 
Thank you. Even a little will help.
[Bunet] 
It makes me happy to know that my little 
flowers will help people feel better.
[Bunet] 
Though, I must say...I'll be sorry to see them 
leave home after all my careful tending.
[Jean] 
Don't worry, Bunet. I won't let a single flower 
go to waste.

[Jean] 
You did me a big favor the other day.
[Jean] 
I put that flower you gave me to good use, and 
it helped in treating a lot of our people.
[Bunet] 
Good. I'm sure those little blooms of mine were 
happy to help.
[Jean] 
Here. This is something in return.
[Bunet] 
Hm... Flower seeds.
[Jean] 
You seemed to care a lot about the flower you 
gave me.
[Jean] 
So I thought it must have made you sad to see 
the space where it used to grow.
[Jean] 
This probably isn't much of a replacement, 
but...it's something to fill the space.
[Bunet] 
How thoughtful. I will make sure to give these 
seeds a loving, supportive home.
[Jean] 
It's the least I can do for the help you gave me.
[Jean] 
Well, I think that's all, so...
[Bunet] 
Jean, wait.
[Jean] 
Yes?
[Bunet] 
Are there any other flowers with medicinal uses 
that I could grow for you?
[Bunet] 
Sometimes I'm sad to see my beautiful flowers 
being plucked, but not when they help people.
[Bunet] 
I want to contribute however I can.
[Jean] 
That's really nice of you, Bunet. It means a lot 
that you're willing to pitch in.
[Jean] 
I'm going to do my part, too, of course. I won't 
leave it all to you.
[Bunet] 
Wonderful. I'm sure my flowers will appreciate 
having another caretaker around.
[Jean] 
Haha, probably so! Keep up the good work, and 
try not to get stung again.
[Bunet] 
No need to tell me twice. I could hardly sleep 
with those tantalizing herbs on me.
