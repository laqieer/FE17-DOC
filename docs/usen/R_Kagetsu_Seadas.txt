[Seadall] 
Hmm... La Roue de Fortune─the Wheel of 
Fortune in the upright position...
[Kagetsu] 1 
[Kagetsu] 
Hello, Seadall. What are you doing?
[Seadall] 
I'm honing my divination powers using a 
Tarot deck.
[Seadall] 
While I'm best known for my dancing, I'm also 
skilled at fortune telling.
[Kagetsu] 
Already you excel, and yet you remain in 
continual practice. You are very dedicated.
[Seadall] 
I have my reasons...
[Kagetsu] 
I see.
セアダスAs long as I'm practicing, I could give your 
fortune a read, Kagetsu.
[Kagetsu] 
Oh, no need. I already have this ability.
[Kagetsu] 
I will demonstrate! Ahem...prepare yourself!
[Kagetsu] 
Soon you will be eating...sliced meats layered 
between two breads!
[Seadall] 
Yes, that's right. But how did you...
[Kagetsu] 
I told you. It is my ability to see the future.
[Seadall] 
You can just...see the future?! Could you show 
me how?
[Kagetsu] 
I am surprised you are so interested! Alas, 
my power cannot be taught.
[Kagetsu] 
I was born with this gift. I did not acquire it 
by learning.
[Kagetsu] 
But it is cooling fans in winter, as they say. 
Useless. I get only inconsequential details.
[Seadall] 
I see.
[Seadall] 
Eh, it sounds like I should probably focus on my 
own divination skills.

[Kagetsu] 
Seadall! I have glimpsed your future again. Your 
performance this evening will be well attended!
[Seadall] 
No need for your skills on that front. My 
performances are always packed full.
[Kagetsu] 
I can also see that it will rain tonight. Be sure 
to prepare for your walk home.
[Seadall] 
That does seem fairly obvious, Kagetsu. Rain 
clouds just rolled in.
[Kagetsu] 
...
[Kagetsu] 
You see? Useful as cooling fans in winter.
[Seadall] 
Your premonitions really do seem to be for the 
most useless things.
[Seadall] 
If this power of yours was only a bit more... 
applicable...I'm sure I'd be quite envious.
[Kagetsu] 
No need to envy abilities like mine when you 
can read fortunes.
[Seadall] 
My fortune-telling skills are well-regarded, 
sure... But sadly, they aren't perfect.
[Kagetsu] 
Why do you say so?
[Seadall] 
My master...the one who taught me to dance... 
he was attacked and killed by thieves.
[Seadall] 
If my divination skills had been perfect, I would 
have seen it coming. I could have saved him.
[Seadall] 
So, I keep honing my skills in hopes I don't ever 
have to experience that kind of regret again.
[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps you would read my fortune, then.
[Seadall] 
Your fortune?
[Kagetsu] 
Yes! You said that you wish to sharpen 
your skills.
[Kagetsu] 
I would gladly serve as your training partner.
[Seadall] 
That would be very helpful. Thank you.
[Kagetsu] 
Think nothing of it!
[Seadall] 
Well then, let's see what fate has in store 
for you.
[Seadall] 
Kagetsu, as the fog of destiny parts to reveal 
what lies ahead, I see...
[Seadall] 
Oh no!
[Seadall] 
It's La Mort...the Death card. And it's in the 
upright position.
[Seadall] 
It means misfortune awaits you.
[Kagetsu] 
What?!

[Kagetsu] 
That was terribly close!
[Seadall] 
Kagetsu! What happened?! Was it...misfortune? 
Was the card right?
[Kagetsu] 
I did not realize...there were bear dens near my 
training ground!
[Seadall] 
But...there's not a mark on you. You seem 
perfectly fine.
[Seadall] 
What a relief! I suppose my divination 
was wrong.
[Kagetsu] 
No... No, it was right!
[Seadall] 
What?
[Kagetsu] 
I was prepared for misfortune. As soon as one 
bear came toward me, I quickly fled.
[Kagetsu] 
Without your prediction, I would have trained as 
normal and failed to notice until too late.
[Seadall] 
So...my fortune telling saved you?
[Kagetsu] 
Indeed, Seadall, it saved my life. Thank you.
[Seadall] 
No. Thank you, Kagetsu. This has given me 
more confidence in my divination skills.
[Kagetsu] 
Good. Phew! This rubbing elbows with death 
has made me hungry.
[Kagetsu] 
...
[Kagetsu] 
Just now I caught some glimpse of you and I 
sitting down to eat.
[Seadall] 
I'm sure your premonition is right. In fact, I bet 
your vision showed us eating sandwiches.
[Kagetsu] 
Meat between two breads─how did you know?!
[Seadall] 
Well, as it happens, I had just decided to treat 
you to a meal.
[Kagetsu] 
Ah! This gives me another vision─one in which 
our friendship blooms.
[Seadall] 
Ha! No need for divination there. We're already 
friends.
