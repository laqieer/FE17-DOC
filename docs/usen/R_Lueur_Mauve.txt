=== Alear & Mauvier ===
--- C ---



[Alear]
Mauvier, I'm curious. What are some of your
favorite things?
[Mauvier]
Pardon? Why would you wish to know?
[Alear]
I've decided to give you a gift as a token of
my gratitude.
[Mauvier]
A gift from the Divine Dragon?
[Mauvier]
For what reason? Perhaps you are mistaken
about who I am.
[Alear]
You are Veyle's knight, yes?
[Alear]
Veyle is alive today because of your actions.
[Alear]
She is my only sibling, and I cannot thank you
enough for protecting her.
[Mauvier]
...
[Alear]
Do you understand why I might want to reward
you for such service?
[Mauvier]
I understand. However...
[Mauvier]
Knowing I have your gratitude is reward
enough.
[Alear]
Only my gratitude?
[Mauvier]
I am pleased you value my efforts to aid the
Lady Veyle.
[Mauvier]
I am not a "good person." As your former
enemy, I am unworthy of your praise.
[Mauvier]
Pardon me. I am needed elsewhere.
[Alear]
Mauvier, you don't...

[Alear]
I've been thinking about how you said you are
not a good person. I heartily disagree.
[Alear]
For example, I've watched you go out of your
way to help people in town.
[Mauvier]
My past actions serve as evidence that I am
otherwise. I strive now only for penance.
[Mauvier]
I once wished to live a humble life. I followed
the Fell Dragon as I was taught.
[Mauvier]
That path led to my becoming the enemy of
many. Most notably, you.
[Alear]
But those days are gone...
[Mauvier]
Anything I say will be a weak excuse for my
part in my own downfall.
[Mauvier]
I failed to stop Lady Veyle or the rampage of
the Four Hounds.
[Mauvier]
So long as I bear those sins, I am unworthy of
redemption or forgiveness.
[Mauvier]
My acts of kindness towards the people of this
town are only a selfish attempt at atonement.
[Alear]
...
[Mauvier]
Any words of praise─from anyone, especially
you─give me no pleasure. Only suffering.
[Alear]
How long do you expect your penance to last?
[Mauvier]
I do not know.
[Mauvier]
I do not think my work will be done, even
after death.
[Mauvier]
I am guilty of too much to hope otherwise.

[Alear]
May I join you as you help the village today?
[Mauvier]
Pardon me?
[Mauvier]
It is inappropriate for the Divine Dragon to
help with such menial tasks.
[Alear]
I disagree.
[Mauvier]
You are a strange one.
[Mauvier]
Why do you feel you must be so kind to me?
[Alear]
Well, I realized something after spending time
with you. We have quite a bit in common.
[Mauvier]
Impossible. You have never engaged in villainy.
[Alear]
We are, each of us, unable to resist offering a
helping hand to those in need.
[Alear]
Our only difference? You momentarily strayed
from the path. But now you are home.
[Mauvier]
Are you making excuses for my actions?
[Alear]
You can't forgive your past mistakes precisely
because you're a good person.
[Alear]
The only fault I can see in your character is that
you don't believe you can be good.
[Alear]
You don't need to burden yourself with shame
or seek atonement...
[Alear]
All you need to do is trust your friends and
stand by their side.
[Mauvier]
...
[Alear]
Please trust me, Mauvier. I want nothing more
than to help you.
[Mauvier]
I have made so many mistakes that I have long
told myself I am beyond redemption.
[Mauvier]
Yet, you make me question my way of thinking.
[Mauvier]
Perhaps the Divine Dragon understands who I
am better than I do myself.
[Alear]
Of course not.
[Mauvier]
I accept your offer of help in the village. That is,
if you are still willing.
[Alear]
Let's get to it.
[Mauvier]
What an odd sensation! My chest feels warm.
[Alear]
That's happiness. A feeling you deserve, and
one you are about to give to others.
[Mauvier]
With the Divine Dragon by my side, anything
is possible.
[Mauvier]
Thank you. I would never have found my way
without you.

[Mauvier]
Thank you for your help today─aiding in the
relief of these troubled people.
[Alear]
Guiding the lost, mediating conflicts... A lot has
happened today.
[Mauvier]
Tiring work, but worth it to see people smile.
[Mauvier]
I've realized my charitable acts were always
penance to alleviate my own pains. No more.
[Alear]
I do see you smile more than you used to.
[Alear]
It's a wonderful thing, seeing you heal.
[Mauvier]
I can trust myself─and others─unlike before.
And it is trust that has helped me to find peace.
[Mauvier]
It is because of you that I have found this truth
about myself.
[Alear]
Oh?
[Mauvier]
Is my statement so odd?
[Alear]
Not at all. I was just thinking how nice it is to
hear that you are happy.
[Alear]
I have been considering something... No.
Perhaps not.
[Mauvier]
Did you just hide something?
[Alear]
No. Not at all. I've not hidden anything.
[Alear]
Oh no...
[Mauvier]
Is this...the Pact Ring? Why would you risk
having something so valuable here?
[Alear]
I─ Um... I was...
[Mauvier]
...
[Mauvier]
Divine One...do you mean to... Will you give
me this ring?
[Alear]
Huh?! I...
[Alear]
This ring marks a bond between myself and
someone I consider very dear to me.
[Alear]
Asking for this ring is saying you wish to be
my partner...
[Alear]
Is that what you want?
[Mauvier]
Indeed.
[Mauvier]
You saved me, body and soul.
[Mauvier]
At first, I was thankful. Then the feeling grew.
You became quite special to me.
[Mauvier]
When I saw the Pact Ring just now, I finally
acknowledged those feelings.
[Mauvier]
I realized I should be the one beside you.
[Alear]
Mauvier...
[Mauvier]
However, I fear I am not worthy of this ring.
Not in this moment.
[Mauvier]
But...I will be someday. Will you consider
my request?
[Alear]
...
[Alear]
You know...I've almost offered you this ring
once or twice before.
[Mauvier]
...
[Alear]
You are brave, fierce, and loving. Your kind
heart is why I'm drawn to you.
[Alear]
Still, I could never work up the courage. I'm so
glad you asked.
[Alear]
I wonder what Veyle would think of this?
[Mauvier]
Lady Veyle recently mentioned that she cares
about us both and our happiness.
[Alear]
Heh, did she? How very Veyle to see what
neither of us would admit.
[Alear]
Well then, it is time for me to muster my
courage after all.
[Alear]
Mauvier, please accept this ring and become
my partner.
[Mauvier]
I accept, and I am honored.
[Alear]
I hope you will cherish this ring and our bond
forever and always.
[Mauvier]
I shall, Divine Dragon .
[Mauvier]
I thought I would never feel happiness. Now I
know nothing else. I will always be by your side.
