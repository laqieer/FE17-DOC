[Yunaka] 
Zappy morning, Panette!
[Panette] 
Good morning, Yunaka. You seem to be in 
good spirits. As usual.
[Yunaka] 
Always! It's one of my redeeming qualities.
[Panette] 
Mm-hmm. In point of fact, I have been meaning 
to ask you about that.
[Panette] 
Why do you insist on pretending to be cheerful 
all the time?
[Yunaka] 
You think I'm acting? You think I'm so talented, 
I can keep it up all the time? I-I'm flattered!
[Panette] 
Ah-ah-ah. Do not bluff a bluffer.
[Panette] 
I can tell that this is not your true manner.
[Panette] 
When I began serving the boss, I had to swap 
out my own dialect for a more proper one.
[Panette] 
Since then, I have had a keen ear for others' 
false tongues.
[Yunaka] 
Takes one to know one, doesn't it...
[Yunaka] 
I can't answer your question, though.
[Yunaka] 
If I spoiled the mystery, who would you harass 
with prying questions? My hands are tied.
[Panette] 
Hm. So be it.
[Panette] 
Forgive me for probing.
[Panette] 
But this duplicity... Somehow it does not sit 
right with me.
[Yunaka] 
Uh huh...

[Panette] 
Yunaka, I cannot help but wonder about 
your past.
[Panette] 
I understand wanting to preserve some secrecy. 
But please...tell me a little about it, won't you?
[Yunaka] 
OK...
[Yunaka] 
My parents abandoned me when I was small. 
After that, growing up was anything but easy.
[Yunaka] 
I don't like thinking about it. And I like talking 
about it even less.
[Panette] 
I am so sorry.
[Panette] 
I know well the pain of being neglected by 
one's parents.
[Yunaka] 
You too? Really?
[Panette] 
Alas, yes. My father was a hopeless drunk. 
My mother was always out partying.
[Panette] 
Who knew that we hailed from such similar 
backgrounds?
[Yunaka] 
I wouldn't have guessed. But it's reassuring, 
in a way. Maybe I feel a little less alone.
[Panette] 
Hm?!
[Yunaka] 
Bandits. Incoming on our position.
[Yunaka] 
I count...nine. Noâ”€ten.
[Panette] 
Thought they could get the jump on us, eh? 
We'll show them.
[Panette] 
Listen up, pinheads! If I was you, I'd think twice 
about messing with me and her!
[Panette] 
One more step and we'll turn your intestines 
into outtestines! Got it?!
[Yunaka] 
We're not here to kill anyone.
[Yunaka] 
But if you're here to be killed, well... My hands 
are tied.

[Yunaka] 
Hear that? Could be more bandits.
[Panette] 
Oh? You goons back for seconds?
[Panette] 
Ha! Ain't often I meet bandits who whine like 
kitty cats!
[Yunaka] 
Oh, no no no, hold up. That actually was a cat. 
Tricksy little hairball set me on edge!
[Panette] 
Oh! Right you are. What a relief!
[Panette] 
I must say, Yunaka, I rather enjoy that vicious 
demeanor you adopt during combat.
[Yunaka] 
I could say the same about you! You're usually 
so polite, but you really let 'em have it!
[Panette] 
Yes. In moments of danger, I sometimes feel my 
blood boil as it used to.
[Yunaka] 
I know the feeling. I slip into my old ways 
sometimes too. As you saw.
[Yunaka] 
We do have a lot in common, don't we? But... 
Let's keep this our little secret.
[Panette] 
Indeed. Which reminds me... I apologize for 
needling you about the way you speak.
[Panette] 
Really, it was quite conceited of me. Glass 
houses and all that.
[Yunaka] 
I get it. Some good came out of it, though. 
I learned my act needs work, for one thing.
[Panette] 
We could practice together, perhaps?
[Yunaka] 
Zappy! Great idea!
[Panette] 
Um, you know, I have always meant to ask...
[Panette] 
What is this "zappy" business all about?
[Yunaka] 
Oh. Well, uh...
[Panette] 
Yes?
[Yunaka] 
That's another one of my mysteries! Wouldn't 
wanna spoil it until we know each other better.
[Panette] 
Ah! In that case, you give me no choice.
[Panette] 
I shall see to it that we become the very best 
of friends!
