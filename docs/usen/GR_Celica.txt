=== Celica & Alfred ===

--- C ---



[Alfred]
Who knew our kingdom's ring had such a
trusty Emblem? I'm glad I get to meet you.
[Celica]
And I you, Alfred. We'll both be needed in this
push to bring peace to the world.

--- B ---



[Celica]
Alfred, it's barely dawn. Why are you awake
so early?
[Alfred]
It's patrol time for me, with my daily jog coming
afterward. Wanna come along?

--- A ---



[Celica]
Alfred? I thought you were taking part in the
war council today.
[Alfred]
Yeah, but it's deadlocked right now. I came out
to get a few reps in and collect my thoughts.
[Alfred]
You're our national Emblem, after all. We've got
to come up with something to make you proud.
[Celica]
That's very sweet, Alfred. Heh, Maybe I could
join you on a run!

=== Celica & Anna ===

--- C ---



[Anna]
In honor of meeting you, I'm holding a special
sale today. I'm gonna rake in the cash!
[Celica]
Oh, what a cute little shop! You've gone to so
much trouble that I have to have a look.

--- B ---



[Celica]
Hey, Anna─sorry, Lady Anna. Did you find any
leads on the location of your family?
[Anna]
No luck yet. But I'm not worried. I'm sure
they're all doing fine!

--- A ---



[Anna]
Feast your eyes, Celica! I've come up with a
new product.
[Celica]
Oh? What is it?
[Anna]
Set the log here, roll a stone down this groove,
and the axe at the other end does all the work!
[Celica]
That's...one way of cutting wood. But it would
probably be faster to chop it yourself.

=== Celica & Bunet ===

--- C ---



[Bunet]
Your ring─the way it's set with a stone─it looks
like candy. Hm, I wonder if it tastes like candy...
[Celica]
You might choke on it if you try to find out.
So, let's just let it remain a mystery, shall we?

--- B ---



[Celica]
Your chef skills are incredible. I can't eat the
food you make, but I love watching you make it.
[Bunet]
I'm happy to hear that, Celica. For dinner, I'll
be sure to serve something beautiful to behold.

--- A ---



[Bunet]
This dish is just the same as any dish from this
world. I'm sorry, Celica. I tried, but I have failed.
[Celica]
It's OK. It's not easy to re-create a dish from my
world with nothing but my verbal instructions.
[Bunet]
I want to make a dish that reminds you of home.
Surely you'd be happy to see such a thing.
[Celica]
Thank you, but just spending the time working
on it together has made me more than happy.

=== Celica & Boucheron ===

--- C ---



[Celica]
Oh no... You look like you've been crying.
Did something terrible happen?
[Boucheron]
It's just this book that's been moving me to
tears. But thanks for worrying about me.

--- B ---




[Boucheron]
You know what I wish I could do? Go to your
world and read all its stories.
[Celica]
I'm not sure how you'd get there, but I could
at least tell you the ones I know.

--- A ---




[Boucheron]
It's rare for you to ask me favors. Is something
troubling you?
[Celica]
I heard there was a lovely forest and wanted to
see it. But it's quite far, and I can't go alone.
[Boucheron]
Sure, I can put on the ring and take you. I've
wanted to see it myself, but I get lost so easily.
[Celica]
Then you handle the walk, I'll handle the
directions, and we'll both have a lovely time.

=== Celica & Céline ===

--- C ---




[Céline]
For all I had hoped to discuss with you, now
that you are before me, I am lost for words.
[Celica]
I know what you mean. But we'll have plenty of
time to get to know each other.

--- B ---



[Celica]
Today's tea smells captivating. Where is
it from?
[Céline]
A farming village known for its single-origin tea.
It's a favorite of mine, so I'm pleased you like it.

--- A ---




[Céline]
Each day I have to speak with you is a joy
unto itself, Celica.
[Celica]
That's very kind of you to say. I feel the
same way.
[Céline]
The only drawback is that I sometimes fear I'll
never be happier than I am now.
[Celica]
Don't worry about that. I believe there are much
happier days than this in store for us all.

=== Celica & Chloé ===

--- C ---



[Chloé]
You're so adorable, Celica. Like you stepped
right from the pages of a fairy tale.
[Celica]
Thank you for the compliment, Chloé. I would
say the same is true of you as well.

--- B ---



[Chloé]
The sight of royalty and Emblems joining forces
never fails to brighten my mood.
[Celica]
It is an inspiring sight, isn't it? You and I are
starting to make an effective duo.

--- A ---



[Chloé]
Celica, can you tell me anything about the food
in your world? Specifically the folk foods.
[Celica]
We had our own signature dishes, if that's what
you mean. I was fond of dagon fillet.
[Chloé]
Dagon fillet?! Just the name sounds incredible.
What kind of food is that?
[Celica]
It's a slice of a sea creature native to Zofia.
One bite is enough to chase away any fatigue!

=== Celica & Citrinne ===

--- C ---



[Celica]
Uh... Excuse me, Citrinne? You're staring at me
so intently. Can I help you with something?
[Citrinne]
Oh! I was just admiring your dress. We seem to
have similar tastes. Who's your designer?

--- B ---




[Citrinne]
My resting scowl made another child cry. I wish
my face wasn't so frightening...
[Celica]
They're just not used to you yet, Citrinne. Deep
down, I'm sure they know how sweet you are.

--- A ---




[Citrinne]
You're skilled at magic, right, Celica? Could you
teach me? I'll repay you with any gift you'd like.
[Celica]
I'd be happy to teach you, but I don't need any
payment. That's how our dynamic works.
[Citrinne]
Our dynamic? Hehe, I hope I'm not presuming
too much. Are you saying we're close friends?
[Celica]
Not presumptuous at all! That's precisely what
I was saying. I'm always happy to help you.

=== Celica & Clanne ===

--- C ---



[Celica]
Clanne? Why are you so far away? Come over
here and chat with me.
[Clanne]
Uh, me? Talk to Lady Celica? Alone?! Oh, wow,
I think I might faint...

--- B ---



[Celica]
Clanne? What's in that jar you carry
everywhere?
[Clanne]
Pickles! They're the best thing. I eat them for
breakfast and they wake me right up!

--- A ---



[Clanne]
You're so kind and warm and reliable. You're
almost like an older sister to me.
[Celica]
Hehe, an "older sister"?
[Clanne]
Oh no. Did I say that out loud? Oh no...
[Celica]
Relax. I'm happy to have a little brother.
It makes working together more fun.

=== Celica & Diamant ===

--- C ---



[Diamant]
It's an honor to fight beside an Emblem of
Firene. Can you share any advice on combat?
[Celica]
The honor is all mine, Diamant. I'm happy to
advise you however I can.

--- B ---



[Diamant]
How did governing work in your world, Celica?
I'd appreciate an outside reference.
[Celica]
I wasn't raised as a princess, so I don't know
very much. But I'm happy to share what I can.

--- A ---



[Diamant]
I'm so thankful you've joined our fight, Celica.
You don't even have a connection to our world.
[Celica]
I wouldn't say I have no connection. It feels as
if being summoned to Elyos was my destiny.
[Diamant]
In that case, I hope you'll see the destiny of
Elyos through to the end.
[Celica]
Of course, Diamant. We'll bring peace to this
world as quickly as we can.

=== Celica & Etie ===

--- C ---



[Celica]
Oh, what a pretty flower! Where did you find it?
[Etie]
That field of flowers just over there. I picked
it while I was out running.

--- B ---




[Etie]
You're so dainty, Celica. I'd think a royal would
want a bit more muscle on the bone.
[Celica]
I don't see how royalty factors into it. Maybe
serving under Alfred has colored your thinking.

--- A ---




[Etie]
If you did want muscle, though, could you build
any? Being an Emblem and all?
[Celica]
I've never tried it, so I can't say for sure.
[Etie]
If you could, then you'd be able to work out
with me. You should give it a go!
[Celica]
That sounds fun! Even if nothing comes of it,
I'll enjoy spending time with you.

=== Celica & Fogado ===

--- C ---




[Fogado]
I know I'm laid back and all, but as it turns out,
I'm actually a prince, in case you didn't know.
[Celica]
Ah, I see. I have had to hide my social status
before, but you're much better at it than I was.

--- B ---




[Fogado]
I wonder if the fighting will end soon. There are
so many places I want to visit when it does.
[Celica]
Traveling sounds lovely, doesn't it? I hope we
can all go on some fun trips together one day.

--- A ---




[Fogado]
You Emblems don't grow old, do you? If I didn't
age, I would travel the world for centuries.
[Celica]
Yes, but we can't move as freely as you. What
would you do when you finished traveling?
[Fogado]
All kinds of things, but mostly I would just go
around meeting new people. That's always fun!
[Celica]
I see why so many people like you, Fogado. May
you spend centuries meeting wonderful people.

=== Celica & Framme ===

--- C ---



[Framme]
I have so many questions for you! What's your
favorite food, your favorite color, your favorite...
[Celica]
Haha! OK, calm down, Framme. I can answer
everything if you ask one question at a time.

--- B ---



[Framme]
Guess what, Lady Celica. Today I got to train
with the Divine One!
[Celica]
You sure do adore the Divine One. Seeing how
happy that makes you makes me happy too.

--- A ---



[Framme]
Um, Lady Celica? What would I have to do to be
as elegant as you?
[Celica]
That's nice of you to think I'm elegant, Framme,
but I think you're lovely the way you are.
[Framme]
But I'm not─not at all! Everyone gets annoyed
at me for being so gawky and unrefined.
[Celica]
No, everyone loves you for being full of energy.
So you just keep being wonderful you.

=== Celica & Goldmary ===

--- C ---



[Goldmary]
I'm sorry if I upstaged you too much in the last
battle, Celica. I know I can be intimidating.
[Celica]
That's...OK? Don't worry about it.

--- B ---



[Celica]
Already done for the day, Goldmary? Most of
the others are still training.
[Goldmary]
No need to overdo it. I've already perfected
my form.

--- A ---



[Goldmary]
I'm curious, Celica. Are Emblems able to bathe?
[Celica]
I'm not sure. Without a physical body, it's never
occurred to me to try.
[Goldmary]
Perhaps we could try going to a hot spring
sometime. You might enjoy it.
[Celica]
Yes, that sounds nice. If nothing else, I think
I would enjoy the atmosphere of such a place.

=== Celica & Hortensia ===

--- C ---



[Hortensia]
Your charm may rival my own, Emblem Celica,
but I will not be outclassed so easily.
[Celica]
You don't need to compare yourself to me,
Hortensia. Your charm is totally unique.

--- B ---



[Hortensia]
You always seem so calm and collected, Celica.
Don't you ever get angry?
[Celica]
Of course. Thugs and bullies who cause trouble
for innocent people make me furious.

--- A ---



[Hortensia]
We know each other well enough by now that I
feel like I can ask... Have you ever been in love?
[Celica]
I have, as a matter of fact. He's strong, brave─
makes you feel like you can handle anything.
[Hortensia]
Aww, you're gushing! Hehe, you sound
completely smitten. It's kind of adorable.
[Celica]
Ask a mushy question, get a mushy answer!

=== Celica & Ivy ===

--- C ---




[Ivy]
The way you Emblems glow and float around...
You're not actually ghosts, are you?
[Celica]
Hehe, I don't feel like a ghost, but now that you
mention it, I don't know.

--- B ---




[Ivy]
You are a princess as well, are you not? Both of
us were born to carry heavy burdens, it seems.
[Celica]
True. But if not for that, I wouldn't have
become an Emblem, and we'd never have met.

--- A ---




[Ivy]
I used to think trust was hard to come by, but
you have proven yourself to me time and again.
[Celica]
I'm glad to hear you trust me. Thank you.
[Ivy]
If you'll go on lending me your power, I promise
to do all I can for both our countries.
[Celica]
I will always be there when you need me, Ivy.
I swear it in Mila's name.

=== Celica & Jade ===

--- C ---



[Celica]
I heard you write novels, Jade. May I read
them sometime?
[Jade]
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, Celica. I was meditating.
What were you saying?

--- B ---



[Celica]
Where do you find inspiration for all of your
novels, Jade?
[Jade]
I people-watch, mostly. Reality is much, much
funnier than it gets credit for.

--- A ---




[Jade]
Our chats have inspired me, Celica. I've been
writing a new story... May I tell you about it?
[Celica]
Of course you may! I always love to hear what
you're working on.
[Jade]
It's about a hero who awakens in another world
with the power to defeat a mysterious threat.
[Celica]
Oh, how harrowing...and so interesting! I'll have
to read this story when you're done.

=== Celica & Jean ===

--- C ---



[Jean]
Celica? Are you injured, or─ Oh. I guess you're
an Emblem, so it can't be that.
[Celica]
I'm fine, don't worry. But I heard you're a very
skilled doctor, so I thought I'd watch you work.

--- B ---



[Jean]
I should have done better today. Why can't
I just get it right?
[Celica]
The battlefield can be scary even for veteran
fighters. Don't get too frustrated with yourself.

--- A ---



[Celica]
Good work, Jean. You had so many patients to
treat today that it must have worn on you.
[Jean]
Thanks for thinking of me. But it was probably
much worse for my patients.
[Jean]
If I was a better doctor, I could treat them faster
and more effectively.
[Celica]
They have their lives, and that's what counts.
You have to take care of yourself too.

=== Celica & Kagetsu ===

--- C ---



[Kagetsu]
I want to see what it is like inside your ring,
Celica! How do I get inside?
[Celica]
Uh, I don't think that's actually possible. Sorry.

--- B ---



[Celica]
You remind me of an old friend. Looking at you
makes me nostalgic.
[Kagetsu]
This friend of yours resembles me, does he?
I wonder if he could match my skill as well!

--- A ---



[Kagetsu]
If we borrow the Divine Dragon's power, we can
face each other in mock combat, yes?
[Celica]
Yes, I believe so.
[Kagetsu]
Then let us do so right away! I long to test my
skill against yours!
[Celica]
If you insist. Let's not forget that we're friends
though, all right?

=== Celica & Lapis ===

--- C ---



[Celica]
Lapis? Why do you have that log?
[Lapis]
I think I might use this to make some shelves.
Let me know if you'd like some too, Celica.

--- B ---



[Lapis]
Aren't taters great? You only need one to grow
a ton! Or, uh, so I've heard. Or read. In a book.
[Celica]
Potatoes can also grow in barren soil, right? We
grew oranges in my home village. I miss that.

--- A ---



[Lapis]
Uh, excuse me, Celica. You look a bit down
today. Did something happen?
[Celica]
I'm fine. Sorry to make you worry. I just have a
hard time watching you get hurt in battle.
[Celica]
Oh, listen to me. That's not a helpful thing to
say, is it? Please, forget I even mentioned it.
[Lapis]
No, no─it's nice to know you care! I don't want
you to worry...so I'll try to grow much stronger.

=== Celica & Lindon ===

--- C ---




[Lindon]
So, you're an Emblem, are you? If you have
time, I'd love to learn more about your world.
[Celica]
You seem like you'd be a good person to teach
me about this world too.

--- B ---



[Celica]
Do you have any new experiments planned
for today?
[Lindon]
No experiment, just my tried-and-true method
for making pastries using magic.

--- A ---




[Lindon]
The world is in a sad state indeed if it needs
a retired old man like me to save it.
[Celica]
You've seen so much that you must have a
good perspective on building a peaceful world.
[Lindon]
I have seen a lot, it's true. Here's hoping I live
long enough to see the world you speak of.
[Celica]
It's not necessarily for you. You cleared the
path, and now it falls to them to walk it.

=== Celica & Louis ===

--- C ---



[Celica]
I'm starting to get used to the way you fight.
We make a good team.
[Louis]
I concur. I look forward to introducing you to
all my friends.

--- B ---



[Louis]
There's nothing I find as moving as seeing two
friends getting along. Wouldn't you agree?
[Celica]
It is a beautiful thing to see others make friends.
But I've also enjoyed making friends with you.

--- A ---



[Celica]
You've seemed a little distant lately. Did I do
something to offend you?
[Louis]
Not at all, Celica. I'm as fond of you as ever.
[Celica]
Then why do you keep your distance? I only
know you're present when I talk to others.
[Louis]
To intrude in that way would be to take a brush
in hand and "improve" on fine art. I would never.

=== Celica & Alear ===

--- C ---




[Alear]
Will you help me bring peace back to this world
as soon as we can?
[Celica]
Of course I will. I won't rest until it's done.

--- B ---




[Alear]
What are you doing, Celica?
[Celica]
Offering a prayer to Mila. You're welcome to
join me if you wish.

--- A ---



[Celica]
The Brand on my right hand is a sign of my
Zofian royal lineage.
[Alear]
It's a simple design, but a pretty one.
[Celica]
I have somewhat mixed feelings about it, but
we're close enough that I wanted to show you.
[Alear]
Thank you for showing me this. I'll do my best
to be worthy of your trust.

=== Celica & Mauvier ===

--- C ---



[Mauvier]
Lady Celica, is there anything that needs doing?
It is rather awkward to simply be...resting.
[Celica]
Nothing at all. I'm here as your ally, not as
your master. Please, take the time to relax.

--- B ---



[Mauvier]
Never has there been a time when I have known
such peace.
[Celica]
I pray that one day this will be the norm for you
and not the exception.

--- A ---



[Mauvier]
I failed in rejecting Lady Veyle's first offer of
friendship. She suffered due to my hesitation.
[Celica]
Yes, but Veyle was only able to smile again
because you were by her side.
[Mauvier]
That is the work of yourself and the others.
I have been unable to help her find happiness.
[Celica]
Mauvier, you are relied upon by Veyle, and the
rest of us as well. Please, understand that.

=== Celica & Merrin ===

--- C ---



[Merrin]
Lady Celica, as a sign of our new friendship, I'll
let you pet my wolf's fur. It's quite soothing.
[Celica]
That's very kind of you, and I would love to,
but...my hand would just pass right through.

--- B ---



[Merrin]
Did you see me in that last battle? I fought with
every ounce of skill I have to make you proud.
[Celica]
Yes, you were incredibly cool, Merrin.
Of course, I would expect no less from you.

--- A ---



[Merrin]
My older brothers, ugh, I'm so annoyed. I'm an
accomplished knight for goodness sakes!
[Celica]
It's not often I see you so angry, Merrin.
What's going on?
[Merrin]
Ugh, Lady Celica! My brothers keep insisting
they're worried about me! Worried about ME!
[Celica]
That reminds me of my older brother. Just try
to think of it as their way of saying, "I love you."

=== Celica & Timerra ===

--- C ---




[Timerra]
♪Clothing is best when it's nice and thin.
Soft and light and perfect for a swim.♪
[Celica]
What a fun little song. What is it called?

--- B ---




[Timerra]
Ugh, I'm dying to go camping. I want to jump
into an oasis and swim around so badly!
[Celica]
Oh my, you do seem worked up. Why don't we
take a walk so you can burn off a bit of energy.

--- A ---




[Timerra]
So, what kind of clothes were popular in your
world? I want to hear all about the fashions!
[Celica]
I'm sorry, but I lived in a priory for a long time,
so I really don't know much about those things.
[Timerra]
A priory?! Oh, well, what did you wear there?
And what was living there like? I wanna know!
[Celica]
I'll tell you all about it. But only if you explain
the fashions of this world to me in return.

=== Celica & Pandreo ===

--- C ---




[Pandreo]
To fight beside someone as revered as you is
just...just WOW! I think I need to say a prayer.
[Celica]
Hehe! Oh, Pandreo. Please, try to think of us as
equals and as friends.

--- B ---




[Pandreo]
Is it prayer time for you too? Your god has got
to be amazing to be worshipped by an Emblem!
[Celica]
No one religion is better than another. They all
have their beauty. Now, let's pray for peace.

--- A ---



[Celica]
Is everything alright, Pandreo? You don't seem
like yourself.
[Pandreo]
I'm sorry, I was just tending to a funeral. No
matter how often I do it, I never get used to it.
[Celica]
You don't have to get used to it, Pandreo. It's
OK to let yourself feel sad when times are sad.
[Pandreo]
It's...OK? Thank you, Lady Celica. I really
needed to hear that.

=== Celica & Panette ===

--- C ---




[Panette]
Good day, Celica. I see the weather is quite
pleasant once again.
[Celica]
It is lovely, isn't it. It's just the sort of weather
that makes me want to get out and about.

--- B ---




[Panette]
I dare say our enemies grow ever stronger. You
must use your power to kick their butts, Celica.
[Celica]
All I can do is bestow my powers on others. But
I'll gladly do it to defeat our enemies, Panette.

--- A ---




[Panette]
Ugh, I'm spittin' mad! I shoulda done so much
better in that fight!
[Celica]
Oh no! What happened to make you so angry?
[Panette]
My goodness! Celica! I do wish you would give
me fair warning before drawing near.
[Celica]
Don't you get tired of pretending? It's OK,
Panette. You don't have to be polite around me.

=== Celica & Rosado ===

--- C ---




[Rosado]
You're adorable, Celica. Would you mind if I
captured your beauty in one little drawing?
[Celica]
With a compliment as sweet as that, how could
I mind? Draw me as much as you would like.

--- B ---




[Rosado]
I'm looking to draw another portrait. Who do
you think should be my next subject?
[Celica]
So hard to say. Everyone has a unique charm
worth capturing.

--- A ---




[Rosado]
The world would be such a peaceful place if
only people put a higher value on cuteness.
[Celica]
How do you figure?
[Rosado]
There's nothing adorable about weapons or
warfare, so people would lose interest in them.
[Celica]
What an interesting thought. Your perspective
on this is fascinating, Rosado.

=== Celica & Saphir ===

--- C ---




[Saphir]
You've got an air of strength about you, Celica.
I appreciate that.
[Celica]
That's not something I hear often. Thank you.

--- B ---



[Celica]
I heard there's a place nearby that's rich with
medicinal herbs. Would you mind taking me?
[Saphir]
Always thinking about how to help folks, huh?
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

--- A ---




[Saphir]
Something I don't understand. How did you get
such immense strength when you hate fighting?
[Celica]
It's true I dislike fighting─but a desire to protect
people motivates me to be strong.
[Saphir]
Not as big a contradiction as I first thought.
Yeah, I can respect that.
[Celica]
Thank you, Saphir. That means a lot to me.

=== Celica & Seadall ===

--- C ---




[Seadall]
So, what did you think of the dance? I tried to
make it worthy of someone such as yourself.
[Celica]
It was enthralling! I was entranced before I
knew it. Your reputation is well earned, Seadall.

--- B ---



[Celica]
Oh, Seadall, why aren't you eating with
everyone else?
[Seadall]
I am careful about the food that fuels my dance.
It can be hard for some to understand, I know.

--- A ---




[Seadall]
You must be bored watching me dance, Celica.
Why don't you join me from time to time?
[Celica]
I appreciate the invitation, but honestly, I'm
worried I won't be very good.
[Seadall]
You have nothing to worry about if you let
your heart lead you through the steps.
[Celica]
Well, if that's all it takes, Seadall, then I think
I will join you in a dance.

=== Celica & Alcryst ===

--- C ---




[Alcryst]
I know I'll be safe in your capable hands, Celica,
but I'm sorry you're stuck with a waste like me.
[Celica]
That's not the least bit true, Alcryst. I'm glad to
fight beside you. Let's combine our strengths!

--- B ---



[Celica]
There you are, Alcryst! Your brother was
looking for you earlier.
[Alcryst]
Oh! Thank you for letting me know... I'm so, so
sorry you had to go to all this trouble for me!

--- A ---



[Celica]
You showed our enemies an impressive display
of power in that last battle. Well done, Alcryst.
[Alcryst]
That can't be true! Please, just forget I'm here.
I should crawl under a rock where I belong...
[Celica]
It is true, Alcryst! After all, it takes real skill to
wield the powers of an Emblem like me.
[Alcryst]
That's so kind of you. Thank you, Lady Celica.
I'm not sure, but...I think I feel a bit happier.

[Amber]
Hey, Celica! I know this comes out of nowhere,
but...do you like alpacas?
[Celica]
A-alpacas? I'm sorry, but...what are alpacas?

--- B ---



[Celica]
You haven't missed a single day of training,
Amber! That's the sign of a great attitude.
[Amber]
Of course! Legendary heroes aren't built in a
single training session, y'know. I'm going for it!

--- A ---




[Amber]
If the legend of the Emblems was true all along,
then every other legend must be true as well!
[Celica]
They might be! This world is full of mysteries.
[Amber]
You agree with me, Celica?! Whoa! That's great!
Come on, let's go search for some legends!
[Celica]
What? You're going right now? And taking me
with you?! How very...Amber of you, Amber.

=== Celica & Vander ===

[Vander]
I admit that, in all my years, I never imagined
fighting alongside Emblems.
[Celica]
It's fascinating how our lives can follow a path
that we didn't realize we were following.

[Celica]
Someday, I'd like to lay flowers at Lumera's
grave. Would you help me?
[Vander]
Of course. The sentiment will surely please
Queen Lumera.

--- A ---



[Celica]
What are you doing, Vander?
[Vander]
Oh, it looks like you've caught this old man
knitting his time away.
[Celica]
I think it's fascinating to watch your hands as
they work. Do you mind if I stay?
[Vander]
No bother at all. You're welcome to join me for
as long as you would like.

=== Celica & Veyle ===

[Veyle]
Celica, I hope it's OK if I ask you this. Do you
think I'm...scary?
[Celica]
No, I'm not scared of you, Veyle. To me, you
are just like the rest of us─you are one of us.

--- B ---




[Veyle]
All the people here are such good people.
I've never had friends like this before, ever.
[Celica]
Oh Veyle, it must feel so good to have them
now. And please, know that I'm your friend too.

--- A ---




[Veyle]
Thank you so much for lending me your
strength, Celica. Now, what can I do in return?
[Celica]
You don't need to do anything. I'm just happy
to spend time with you.
[Veyle]
But that's not enough. Please, tell me what
I can do for you.
[Celica]
OK... Go, find your happiness. And then, find
even more happiness. That is all I could want.

=== Celica & Yunaka ===

[Celica]
Where are you off to, Yunaka?
[Yunaka]
What?! Nowhere! OK, maybe somewhere.
How did you know I was up to something?

--- B ---



[Yunaka]
That's a fancy looking weapon you've got there,
Celica. Mind if I take a closer look?
[Celica]
Not at all─but I'm not sure whether it will
measure up to your exacting standards.

--- A ---



[Celica]
Talking to you is always interesting, Yunaka.
I've picked up so many new words and phrases.
[Yunaka]
Oh no. Have you been taking notes?
[Celica]
Yes. You have so many expressions that I never
would have heard in my world. I enjoy them!
[Yunaka]
Celica, no! You're toying with powers you
don't understand!

=== Celica & Zelkov ===

[Celica]
Nothing like a bit of peace and quiet, is there?
I relish these opportunities to relax.
[Zelkov]
Every word you just said is *anathema* to me.

--- B ---



[Celica]
When you have some spare time, Zelkov,
there's somewhere I'd like us to go.
[Zelkov]
I try my hardest *never* to have spare time,
but we can make arrangements.

--- A ---



[Celica]
Thank you for showing me the candles you've
made. You have such a wide variety of skills.
[Zelkov]
No need to *thank* me. All of this is purely
for the sake of killing time.
[Celica]
The results are impressive nevertheless. Your
crafts are as lovely as I've seen anywhere.
[Zelkov]
If my pursuits make you *happy*...I suppose
there are worse things.
