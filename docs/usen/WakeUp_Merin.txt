Wow. So this is the Divine Dragon's very 
own bedchamber...


Seeing the Divine Dragon in sleeping form...
What an incredible opportunity.
Maybe one day I'll get to see the sleeping 
dragon form too.


Good morning.
Now then, Divine One...
if you're ready...
please take my hand.


What a beautiful morning.
Almost as beautiful as you.

Haah... Haah...
A rare Lythos hamster! But where did it go?


I know you're in here...
There you are!
Aww, it's grooming itself.
And right by the Divine Dragon's bed. 
How cute!


Sorry for disturbing you.
A rare little fuzzball ran in here.
I mean...
it's not as rare as you, of course!


Oh, did I wake you?
Sorry.
A rare critter...
is here somewhere!

What an invigorating morning it is, Divine One.


What is that flapping sound?
NO!
It's a blue parrot of Lythos! They can only be 
found here!
It's so cute!


Good morning.
Divine One, you must see this.
Over there! It's a rare blue─ Oh!
It's gone.


Bright and beautiful.
Perfect for a walk.
Please, take my hand.

Pardon me, Divine One, but it is time to wake. 
The world awaits you.


Remember, no more observations, Merrin.
You do not want to make the Divine Dragon 
unhappy again.
Keep this wake-up nice and cool.


Greetings.
For breakfast...
I suggest something sweet.
And a brisk walk after.


There now...
I hope you enjoyed my stylish wake-up.
Let's go see everyone, shall we?

Hey!
I will get a good look at you today, you adorable 
critter you!


Aha!
You are a new species!
And bouncing right by the Divine Dragon!
I dub you the Somniel springing mouse.


Guess what!
A new rare critter!
I saw it!
Ugh. I'll never be able to sleep tonight.


Divine One!
I'm looking for a rare fluffball with rabbity ears!
Want to help me?


--- A2 ---

Quietly... Aw, the Divine Dragon slumbers with 
such dignity.


Hm, yes, perfect sleeping position.
Strong, steady breathing...like a breeze over 
a field of grass.
I've never seen such a peaceful sleep.


I apologize.
I was thinking about my book.
There's so much to tell.
And it's hard to put into words.


I must tell you...
It's good you sleep well.
But honestly...
I'm most happy when you're awake.

I am here, my Divine One.


Look at you...
Sound asleep...
and so very lovely.
Not because you're a dragon...
I promise.
You're lovely to me because...
you are you.


Good morning.
You heard what I said, didn't you?
I guess there's no way to maintain my cool 
around you.
I hope you don't mind.


Good morning.
I love watching you wake up.
Greeting each day with you...
It means everything to me.


--- S2 ---

No springing mice allowed!
Get back here!


You've taken a shine to the Divine Dragon, 
haven't you?
I see you snuggling up there.
Hey! Have you been doing this...
when I'm not here?!
No fair!
You, my little fluffball...
can't keep the Divine Dragon to yourself.


Morning.
That cute critter─
What?! I'm the cute one?!
I know what you're trying to do.
You're trying to make me blush.


I'm sorry I woke you.
On your head...
you've got a cute little critter.
You know...
you're pretty cute too.
