[Rosado] 
Hey, Goldmary! Could you teach me how 
to cook?
[Goldmary] 
I could, but why the sudden interest?
[Rosado] 
I've been thinking...
[Rosado] 
When it comes to cuteness, I'm obviously 
miles ahead of you.
[Goldmary] 
Excuse me?
[Rosado] 
But you're still better than me at a lot of things. 
And cooking is one of your many talents.
[Rosado] 
So I figure, if I really want to compete with 
you, I should learn. How hard could it be?
[Goldmary] 
Sorry, but I'm still not past the part where you 
said you're miles ahead of me in cuteness.
[Rosado] 
Really? Well, we can come back to that 
another day.
[Rosado] 
The important thing is I want to learn to cook, 
and I want you to teach me. What do you say?
[Goldmary] 
Not the most flattering way to ask for a favor.
[Goldmary] 
But since we're friends... All right. I'll teach you.
[Rosado] 
Yes! Thanks, Goldmary!
[Rosado] 
Soon I'll be adorable and multitalented!
[Goldmary] 
I suppose we'll see...

[Rosado] 
Dang it, Goldmary! Why are my omelets not as 
good as yours?!
[Rosado] 
I followed all the steps you showed me. 
What am I missing?
[Goldmary] 
There's a trick to it. You'll pick it up 
with practice.
[Rosado] 
Why is cooking so much harder than eating? 
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.
[Goldmary] 
Giving up already? You've only just started.
[Rosado] 
It's not that I want to give up. I just don't want 
the stress of being bad at something.
[Goldmary] 
You know, Rosado...
[Goldmary] 
You have so many wonderful qualities.
[Rosado] 
Aw, thanks! Wait, why are you complimenting 
me all of a sudden?
[Goldmary] 
In fact, you're one of the most charming 
people I've ever met.
[Goldmary] 
Giving up just because you weren't perfect 
right away, though...
[Goldmary] 
That's the only thing that could ever make you 
look like a loser.
[Rosado] 
Oh...
[Goldmary] 
Ah, well. I guess it can't be helped.
[Goldmary] 
You've already decided you don't want 
the stress.
[Goldmary] 
Consider our cooking lessons canceled.
[Rosado] 
Wait.
[Rosado] 
No. I wanna keep going.
[Goldmary] 
Ah, you do?
[Rosado] 
Yes! Let me take dinner shift tonight. I'll make 
omelets for everybody!
[Goldmary] 
That should give you all the practice you need.

[Rosado] 
Well, Goldmary? How's the omelet?
[Goldmary] 
Excellent. You got the texture just right.
[Goldmary] 
I knew you could do it. That's why I didn't want 
you to quit.
[Rosado] 
I stuck with it because of what you said.
[Rosado] 
I'm one of the most charming people you've 
ever met, but I'll be a loser if I quit too easily.
[Goldmary] 
Well remembered.
[Rosado] 
They were familiar words.
[Rosado] 
Hortensia said basically the same thing to me 
back at the academy.
[Goldmary] 
I know. She told me about how you first 
behaved when you started there.
[Goldmary] 
You were so focused on being popular that you 
completely neglected your studies.
[Rosado] 
Yeah. She said no matter how cute or charming 
I am, I'll be a loser if I don't apply myself.
[Rosado] 
It's not enough just to be cute. I have to work 
to improve too. You reminded me of that.
[Goldmary] 
I'm so glad. It wouldn't have looked good 
for me to be friends with a quitter.
[Goldmary] 
Then again, if you really were a loser, we would 
never have become friends in the first place.
[Goldmary] 
I'm still not sure I understand why exactly 
you wanted to learn to cook, though.
[Rosado] 
I'm trying to be...your equal, Goldmary.
[Rosado] 
You always have my back in battle. I want you 
to feel like you can trust me too.
[Rosado] 
So I guess you could say I'm trying to...grow. 
As a person.
[Goldmary] 
That's very sweet, but I have to ask...
[Goldmary] 
How is your being a good cook supposed to 
help me trust on you on the battlefield?
[Rosado] 
...
[Goldmary] 
It's all right. Even if all your hard work means 
nothing, I'm still proud of you.
[Rosado] 
Ugh... OK, OK, you made your point.
[Goldmary] 
Haha, don't worry! I trust you with my life, 
whether on the battlefield or in the kitchen.
[Rosado] 
Good. I won't let you down.
