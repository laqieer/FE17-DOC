=== Céline & Mauvier ===

[Mauvier]
Princess Céline, may I ask you something?
[Céline]
You may.
[Mauvier]
Are you aware of a hill in Firene where a
lone broadleaf tree stands?
[Céline]
A lone, broadleaf tree? None spring to mind.
[Céline]
Why do you ask?
[Mauvier]
I do not know if you are aware, but I was born
in Firene.
[Mauvier]
Throughout my childhood, my family would
travel to that hillside.
[Mauvier]
The name of the region eludes me, but I will
always remember the beauty of that scenery.
[Mauvier]
I wish to visit that place again, if I can.
[Céline]
My goodness. I had no idea that you hailed
from Firene.
[Céline]
But you've given me little to go on when it
comes to the site in question.
[Mauvier]
I apologize. I realize now how little information
I have to offer for the search.
[Mauvier]
I have wonderful memories of my days there.
Sometimes, I can almost smell the air.
[Céline]
You carry a profound emotional attachment to
this place, don't you?
[Céline]
Very well. I cannot abandon the plight of a
native Firenese friend so easily.
[Céline]
I shall do what I can to help you.
[Céline]
As princess of Firene, I vow to find this place
from your memories.
[Mauvier]
Thank you, Princess Céline.

[Céline]
Does this one stir anything?
[Mauvier]
Hmm... No. It is unfamiliar.
[Céline]
How about this one, then?
[Mauvier]
No, I do not recognize that scene either.
[Céline]
Drat. These are all the paintings I have of
famous landscapes around Firene.
[Céline]
Yet none of them appear to be the place you
remember so keenly.
[Mauvier]
I am sorry. You took the time to procure these,
but they stir no memories.
[Céline]
Is there anything else about this place, other
than the scenery, that you can recall?
[Mauvier]
Hm...
[Mauvier]
I remember now.
[Mauvier]
Meat pies. My mother would make them.
[Mauvier]
My parents and I would picnic beneath the
broadleaf tree and take in the scenery.
[Mauvier]
Those pies were wonderful.
[Céline]
Heh heh, what a delightful thing to recall.
[Mauvier]
I'm sorry. I know none of that story helps to
find the location I seek.
[Céline]
Never mind that. It must have been a joyous
time for you.
[Mauvier]
...
[Mauvier]
Oh. I think I understand now.
[Mauvier]
For all this time...
[Céline]
Mauvier? Is something amiss?
[Mauvier]
Princess Céline, you have been a tremendous
help to me.
[Mauvier]
I have all the information I need.
Thank you again.
[Mauvier]

[Céline]
Ah, Mauvier, wait!
[Céline]
What brought that on, I wonder?

[Céline]
Mauvier, why did you abandon our search for
the place from your childhood?
[Mauvier]
Princess Céline.
[Mauvier]
I am sorry.
[Mauvier]
I should explain myself since it was your help
that solved my dilemma.
[Céline]
I won't pry if it's a sensitive subject. I was
merely curious.
[Mauvier]
Not at all. You see, I was certain that, with your
help, I could find the hilltop from my memories.
[Mauvier]
Then I came to a realization.
[Mauvier]
My memories are not special because of the
beauty of the place.
[Mauvier]
I remember that hill and its lone broadleaf tree
because of the happy times with my family.
[Céline]
Ah, I see.
[Mauvier]
My mother's smile. My father tousling my hair.
We would talk, laugh, and enjoy life together.
[Mauvier]
And the meat pies, oh, they were my favorite.
I knew only happiness during those picnic days.
[Céline]
Oh, Mauvier...
[Mauvier]
I realize now that I would not be so moved
were I to find that hillside today.
[Mauvier]
My parents are long departed from this world.
With them gone, that hill is only a hill.
[Céline]
...
[Céline]
I propose that we keep searching for that place.
[Mauvier]
Pardon?
[Céline]
Your family may be gone, but I think we might
all enjoy spending time there together with you.
[Mauvier]
Princess Céline...
[Mauvier]
That is a generous offer, and I accept. Both your
help and your company are most welcome.
[Céline]
It would be my pleasure.
[Céline]
Let us locate the site that you may form new
and joyous memories there with your friends.
[Mauvier]
Thank you, Princess Céline.
