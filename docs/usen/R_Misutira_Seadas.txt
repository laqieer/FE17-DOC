♪Mmm mmm mmm...♪

[Seadall] 
Agh!
[Timerra] 
Yikes! Seadall, what's with the shouting?
[Seadall] 
This was not part of the deal, Princess Timerra! 
You're breaking your promise!
[Timerra] 
Yeah, no. I'm drawing a blank here.
[Seadall] 
The deal was, you wouldn't cook your 
roast-meat specialties around me!
[Seadall] 
Look at this! Smell this! Your dishes have far 
more flavor than any dish should. You promised.
[Timerra] 
Oooh. That does ring a bell, now that you 
mention it.
[Timerra] 
Something about...big flavors being a big 
distraction? Er, my roasts, most of all?
[Seadall] 
You swore you wouldn't cook your dishes near 
me. Yet here you are─you and your meat!
[Seadall] 
Everything I eat is carefully chosen to guide my 
dancing. Now, I want to stuff that in my mouth!
[Timerra] 
Oh, sure! Have at it.
[Seadall] 
Ugh!
[Seadall] 
Spirit of the cards! Cast your divine light and 
show me how to defeat this demon's trap!
[Timerra] 
Demon?! I was trying to be polite!
[Timerra] 
If it bothers you that much, why not go away 
and let me eat in peace?
[Seadall] 
Oh, I'll leave all right. I will go far, far, far away. 
I will beat this trial, you'll see!
[Seadall] 
Moon and stars, I beg of you...keep me from 
this meaty temptation!
[Seadall] 

[Timerra] 
Yeesh. That was weird.

[Timerra] 
♪Mmm mmm mmm! Tasty, tasty meat. So nice 
and chewyyy!♪
[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Agh!
[Timerra] 
Oh no. Don't you start.
[Seadall] 
Again? You're breaking your promise again?!
[Seadall] 
I can smell it! You've got one of your too-tasty 
dishes on the grill. Oh, the sizzling!
[Timerra] 
Relax, would you? You're acting weird again.
[Timerra] 
I mean, you're a world-renowned dancer─not to 
mention a famous fortune-teller!
[Timerra] 
People say you're so dignified, so composed. 
I used to dream of meeting the great Seadall.
[Seadall] 
Are you disappointed?
[Timerra] 
No. About 90 percent of the time, you live up to 
the hype. You act different around, er, flavor?
[Seadall] 
My apologies, Princess Timerra. I blame 
the meat.
[Seadall] 
The way you prepare your dishes, the bold 
flavors are just beyond delicious.
[Timerra] 
Tell me something I don't know.
[Seadall] 
Princess Timerra...
[Seadall] 
Why do you always start roasting meat when 
I'm around?
[Timerra] 
That's not quite what's happening, is it? Come 
on. Give it another think.
[Timerra] 
The truth is, when I've got a good roast going, 
you find me and barge in.
[Seadall] 
So, you're saying...I'm doing this to myself?
[Timerra] 
Yup!
[Seadall] 
I see...
[Seadall] 
Allow me to apologize, Princess Timerra. You 
didn't break your promise.
[Seadall] 
I simply lack willpower. That's my fault, 
not yours.
[Seadall] 
I'll make sure I don't come looking for you when 
you're cooking with such...flair and flavor.
[Seadall] 
If you'll excuse me.
[Seadall] 

[Timerra] 
Seadall, wait!

♪Fry, fry, fry! Get nice and crispy!♪
[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Oh... Oh no...
[Seadall] 
The smells found me and pulled me back 
once again.
[Seadall] 
I couldn't help myself. I'm so sorry, 
Princess Timerra.
[Timerra] 
Relax, Seadall.
[Timerra] 
I lured you here on purpose.
[Seadall] 
You lured me?
[Timerra] 
Yup. I did some digging and found out you 
prefer your meat fried.
[Seadall] 
Why would you do that to me?
[Timerra] 
Uh-oh! Watch out, Seadall! It's a fried meat 
sandwich!
[Seadall] 
Oh no! That's my favorite food!
[Timerra] 
I know!
[Timerra] 
Oh, here's another one. It's got a honey glaze 
and a creamy cheese sauce.
[Seadall] 
Ahh! That's my other favorite food!
[Seadall] 
Princess Timerra, why?
[Seadall] 
Why would you make the food that's hardest 
for me to resist? What are you thinking?
[Timerra] 
I'm thinking you should do more than just eat 
bland food all the time!
[Seadall] 
What?!
[Seadall] 
Don't you see? My whole life is discipline. My 
dancing in and out of battle depends on it!
[Timerra] 
Look. As the next queen of Solm, all I want is 
for my people to be happy.
[Timerra] 
So let me ask you... What would make 
you happy?
[Seadall] 
In this moment, what would make me happy...is 
eating the things in front of me─all the things.
[Timerra] 
Then why fret? Do what makes you happy!
[Timerra] 
Look. Enjoy this delicious meal with me, and 
then afterward...
[Timerra] 
I'll treat myself to some delightful dancing with 
you. Is it a deal?
[Seadall] 
But, Princess Timerra...
[Timerra] 
I promise, a little indulgence never hurt anyone. 
Am I right or am I right?
[Seadall] 
Yes. You're right.
[Seadall] 
Thank you. Mmm...just look at all the incredible 
food you made for me.
[Seadall] 
Here I go. It's high time I live a little.
[Timerra] 
That's the spirit! Come on, dig in before it 
gets cold!
[Seadall] 
Let the feast of flavors begin!
