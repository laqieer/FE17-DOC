[Alfred] 
Amber, got a sec?
[Amber] 
Sure, Prince Alfred. What's up?
[Alfred] 
People tell me you know a lot.
[Alfred] 
Especially when it comes to rumors and myth.
[Amber] 
Oh, totally! All legends are true if you choose to 
believe them...and I believe a LOT of 'em.
[Alfred] 
Well, there's something I always wondered that 
maybe you could help me with.
[Alfred] 
Have you ever heard a legend about a kind of 
medicine that makes you ultra-muscular?
[Amber] 
Muscular?
[Alfred] 
No, ULTRA-muscular.
[Amber] 
Huh... No, I don't think I've heard that legend.
[Alfred] 
Damn. I thought if anybody might know more, 
it'd be you.
[Amber] 
Well, now that I've heard about it from you, 
I can't just ignore it. I have to know!
[Amber] 
I'll uncover the legend of that muscle-boosting 
medicine no matter what!
[Alfred] 
Really? You're a peach, Amber!
[Amber] 
Aw, no sweat. I live for this lore-y, 
legend-y stuff.
[Amber] 
I'll start poking around right now!
[Amber] 
Hey, muscles! Yeah, you with the big arms! 
How'd you get so huge?
[Amber] 
[Alfred] 
Now we're getting somewhere. If there's anyone 
you can trust to get it done, it's Amber!

[Amber] 
Even the sharpest lance will bend and warp. 
A thousand arrows will bounce right off.
[Amber] 
Just one of these pills will turn your muscles to 
pure steel and your body into a fortress.
[Amber] 
That's the power of the legendary muscle- 
boosting medicine...Suprotein!
[Alfred] 
Suprotein?
[Amber] 
Yep.
[Alfred] 
Not doubting you here, but...that name makes 
this whole thing seem unbelievable.
[Amber] 
Oh-ho! But that's exactly how legends work.
[Amber] 
Bizarre names. Vague clues. Following your gut 
instincts into the unknown...
[Amber] 
This is how legends transform into epic quests!
[Amber] 
What's it gonna be, Prince Alfred?
[Amber] 
Are you ready to follow your dreams and 
embark on the adventure of a lifetime?
[Amber] 
This quest is worth undertaking as long as you 
believe it is! Do you believe, Prince Alfred?
[Alfred] 
You're darn right I believe! You've worked too 
hard tracking this down for me to doubt you.
[Alfred] 
All right then, where do we find this Suprotein?
[Amber] 
OK, I have everything we need to get started.
[Amber] 
Let's see... From here, it'll take about a year to 
reach the medicine's location.
[Alfred] 
Why so long?
[Amber] 
It comes in a pill that can only be found on this 
one mountaintop that pokes above the clouds.
[Alfred] 
This doesn't sound like an easy trip. I don't 
think now is the time for me to be ducking out.
[Alfred] 
I hate to say it, but I might have to put this 
muscle quest on hold for now.
[Amber] 
Oh. I guess you're right. Man, I really hyped this 
one up without thinking, huh? Sorry.
[Alfred] 
What are you talking about? You just gave me 
the best gift of all!
[Amber] 
I did?
[Alfred] 
Something to work toward─a dream.
[Amber] 
Whoa! Yes, Prince Alfred! I love that!
[Alfred] 
Haha, glad you're back on board.

[Amber] 
Morning, Prince Alfred!
[Alfred] 
Morning, Amber!
[Amber] 
You're up pretty early again.
[Alfred] 
It's never too early for a workout.
[Amber] 
You're amazing, Prince Alfred. You never miss 
a day of training, do you?
[Amber] 
I don't know how you do it.
[Alfred] 
It's simple─workouts are fun.
[Alfred] 
It's like you and your myth-chasing. Even when 
that gets tough, you never give up, right?
[Amber] 
Huh. Yeah, that's true.
[Alfred] 
Besides, I can't afford not to stay in shape.
[Amber] 
Oh, sure! Because we're in the middle of a war.
[Alfred] 
True! But I'm looking ahead to after the 
war too.
[Amber] 
What do you mean?
[Alfred] 
What? Did you forget the dream already?
[Amber] 
Huh?
[Alfred] 
At the peak of some far-off mountain is every 
weight lifter's dream.
[Alfred] 
If I'm gonna build the strength to get there, 
I've gotta start training now.
[Amber] 
Wait, you mean the Suprotein legend? I thought 
you gave up on that!
[Alfred] 
Nah, I put it on hold. Big difference. I might still 
go after it once the war's done.
[Alfred] 
It's a reason to keep going. Can't fall before I 
get my hands on the prize, right?
[Amber] 
But...Prince Alfred...
[Amber] 
You'd do all this prep when there isn't a single 
shred of evidence that Suprotein is real?
[Alfred] 
It doesn't matter. A dream's not about facts. 
It's about believing.
[Amber] 
Yes! Totally! That's exactly how I feel!
[Amber] 
Chasing legends is the best!
[Alfred] 
Haha, I'm just having fun in life. That's all.
[Amber] 
Me too! I want to have that exact kind of fun! 
Can I train with you?
[Amber] 
I also believe in Suprotein...so let me chase that 
legend too!
[Alfred] 
Sure! I'd love to have you aboard.
[Alfred] 
We may be from different kingdoms, but we 
can still share the same dream.
[Amber] 
Prince Alfred, if you get any cooler, my head's 
gonna explode!
