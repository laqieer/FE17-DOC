[Framme] 
I wanna get my parents something, but what?
[Anna] 
Hey, Framme!
[Framme] 
Oh! Hey, Anna. Whatcha doing?
[Anna] 
Oh, "Anna" is so formal. Call me "Lady Anna"!
[Framme] 
Oh, right. Sorry. I meant, "Hey, Lady Anna!"
[Anna] 
Yep, there you go. So, what are you in the 
market for today?
[Framme] 
I'm looking for an anniversary present for 
my folks.
[Framme] 
Oh─you're a merchant! Do you have anything 
like that for sale?
[Anna] 
Framme, Framme, Framme. Of course I do.
[Anna] 
Feast your eyes! You won't find gifts cheaper 
or better than these anywhere.
[Framme] 
Ooh! These knick-knacks are so cute! I bet this 
statuette would look good in their house.
[Anna] 
Tell you what. Since we're friends, I'll throw in 
an engraving of their names for free.
[Framme] 
Hmm, that's tempting. You're pretty good at 
this, Lady Anna!
[Anna] 
I got separated from my family. Being on my 
own has really put my sales skills to the test.
[Anna] 
But look, everything I stock is rare and valuable. 
Your parents will love their gift, guaranteed.
[Framme] 
In that case, I think I'll get this statuette. Some 
engraving would make it seem extra-special.
[Anna] 
Thanks for the business! I'll gift wrap it for you, 
too, if you wait right there.
[Framme] 
You may be young, but you've really got this 
merchant thing down.
[Framme] 
One thing's for sure─I'm not gonna make the 
mistake of calling you plain ol' Anna again!

[Framme] 
Thanks a bunch, Lady Anna!
[Anna] 
Thanks for what?
[Framme] 
I sent my parents the gift I bought from you, 
and they wrote back with a thank-you letter!
[Anna] 
Oh, yeah! You did pick a great gift, it's true.
[Framme] 
Yep! They loved it, just like you guaranteed 
they would.
[Anna] 
It's my business to satisfy my customers. I hope 
that means you'll shop with me again.
[Framme] 
Sure will! Oh, and look at this part of the letter 
from my mom.
[Anna] 
Let's see here...
[Anna] 
"The statuette was lovely. Be sure to thank your 
friend Lady Anna for us.
[Anna] 
"We'd love to host her, too, if you ever have a 
chance to visit home.
[Anna] 
"Tell her I'll treat her to one of my famous 
home-cooked meals if she comes along."
[Framme] 
My mom's not kidding about her cooking being 
famous. So you should definitely come visit!
[Anna] 
...
[Framme] 
Did I say something wrong?
[Anna] 
...
[Anna] 
I wanna send my family a letter too!
[Framme] 
Aww, Lady Anna...
[Framme] 
I forgot that you're on your own right now, 
away from your family...
[Framme] 
I'm sorry I made you think about sad stuff. 
But it's OK! You've got us!
[Anna] 
Thanks, Framme... I really appreciate that.
[Anna] 
Tell your mom thanks for me too. And tell her 
I'd be happy to come over sometime.
[Framme] 
Will do!
[Anna] 
OK, enough moping around!
[Anna] 
Nobody buys from a depressed merchant. 
Gotta smile to sell!

[Anna] 
Come one, come all! Step right up and see!
[Anna] 
I've got great deals on rare goods! It's a one- 
time offer─buy now or regret it later!

[Framme] 
How's business, Lady Anna?
[Anna] 
Business is booming! My inventory's flying off 
the shelves faster than I can restock.
[Framme] 
Well, here. Something for the hardest-working 
merchant I know.
[Anna] 
Are these tarts?
[Framme] 
Yep! Beet tarts, in fact. I made them myself, 
so I know they're good.
[Anna] 
Can I try one?
[Framme] 
Sure!
[Anna] 
Nice! Down the hatch!
[Anna] 
Mmm, yum! These really are tasty!
[Framme] 
Hehe, I'm glad you like them. I learned the 
recipe from my mom.
[Anna] 
Your mom...
[Framme] 
Oh no! Uh, I mean─ I, um...
[Framme] 
I'm so sorry, Lady Anna! I wasn't trying to make 
you feel sad!
[Anna] 
Oh, I've got the perfect sales angle for 
those pies!
[Framme] 
Huh?
[Anna] 
We'll call them "Mom's Sweet Beets." They'll be 
a hit with kids and grown-ups alike!
[Anna] 
Ooo, you gotta teach me how to make 'em!
[Framme] 
Haha! Whew, I thought I'd said the wrong 
thing again.
[Anna] 
Don't worry about it. I told you before that 
smiles make sales, right?
[Anna] 
I'm gonna ride this smile to a boatload of cash 
to search for my family!
[Framme] 
Oh, good plan! I'll pitch in, and teach you that 
recipe so you can make lots of money!
[Anna] 
Perfect! Ooo, thank you!
[Anna] 
Once I get these tarts on the market, we'll be 
swimming in cash. Cha-ching!
