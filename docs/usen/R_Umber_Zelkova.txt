=== Amber & Zelkov ===
--- C ---



[Zelkov]
Amber, I wish to *speak* with you.
[Amber]
You? The retainer of the crown princess? Of
Elusia? You want to talk to ME?
[Amber]
I can tell you right now, if you're fishing for
intel on Brodia stuff, I am not your target.
[Zelkov]
No, no. It is not a *political* matter.
[Zelkov]
It is rather more *personal* than that.
[Amber]
Oh no. What do you want with me? Is it a fight?
I haven't even done anything to you!
[Zelkov]
I require the *wool* of an alpaca.
[Amber]
Huh?
[Zelkov]
Specifically, I require the wool that comes from
a *particular* alpaca hamlet.
[Zelkov]
I have been led to believe you are *familiar*
with this place.
[Zelkov]
You should be aware, then, that the *wool* from
there is finer than any other.
[Amber]
Yeah, that's true. The alpacas back home are
extra furry and SUPER fluffy.
[Zelkov]
I must have it, Amber. You must *procure* it
for me.
[Amber]
Well, I could send a letter back home. They'd
ship some here for sure...but what's it for?
[Zelkov]
It will be put toward the purpose of *knitting.*
[Amber]
Whoa. You like to knit, Zelkov? I never, ever
would have guessed that.
[Zelkov]
It should not *surprise* you that I pursue a craft
of such delicate grace and elegance.
[Zelkov]
To the point, I require the highest-quality alpaca
wool to craft my *ultimate* masterpiece.
[Amber]
I'm into it! If it's just for crafting, I'll get you a
bunch of the stuff. No sweat.
[Amber]
Besides, I've gotta see what you make with it.
I bet it's gonna be weird.
[Zelkov]
Thank you, Amber. I am grateful for your
*assistance* in this matter.

[Amber]
Sorry to keep you waiting, Zelkov! Guess what
just arrived? It's the alpaca wool from home!
[Zelkov]
Most excellent. With respect to *fluff,* it
surpasses my wildest expectations.
[Amber]
Of course it does! Alpaca wool is warm, light,
and super tough. It's the perfect material!
[Zelkov]
This is indeed the finest. The creation of my
*ultimate* masterpiece is now assured.
[Zelkov]
When all the knitting world lays eyes upon my
work, Amber, *you* will have their gratitude.
[Amber]
My family knits things with alpaca wool too.
See my sweater under here? My dad made this!
[Zelkov]
I see. Now, as to the matter of *payment...*
[Amber]
Oh, I don't need any money. Consider it a gift!
[Zelkov]
One must give payment for services rendered.
Otherwise, one has incurred a *debt.*
[Amber]
Really, it's fine. When I wrote to my folks about
you, they were happy to send the wool.
[Amber]
I told them you wanted to craft with our farm's
famous fuzzy stuff, and they said it was free!
[Amber]
You wouldn't turn down an act of kindness
from some humble alpaca farmers, would you?
[Zelkov]
If it is for the sake of the ones who provided
it to me, then *reluctantly* I will accept.
[Zelkov]
But they shall have a token of my gratitude.
A sweater of *pristine* craftsmanship.
[Zelkov]
I can express the true extent of my appreciation
*only* by surpassing the quality of their craft.
[Amber]
Whoa! I bet the folks at home would be thrilled
to get a sweater knit by you, Zelkov.
[Zelkov]
Then it is decided. I will not rest until the whole
of your family *marvels* at what I produce.

[Zelkov]
My great work is *complete,* Amber. This is
what I will send to your family.
[Amber]
Whoa! Zelkov! I can't believe it. The stitching...
The craftsmanship...
[Amber]
This is the most perfect sweater I've ever seen!
It even beats my own family's work!
[Zelkov]
I have now *expressed* my gratitude. Farewell.
[Amber]
Hey, Zelkov! Wait!
[Zelkov]
Hm? Do you have some *additional* business?
[Amber]
I really mean it. You just surpassed generations
of homegrown knitting skills in a single sweater.
[Amber]
I know you put a lot of effort into it...but there
has to be a secret. How did you do it?
[Zelkov]
Idle pursuits provide me a reason to continue
living. They are a *failsafe,* of sorts.
[Amber]
What, like a...back-up plan?
[Zelkov]
To me, the most frightening prospect is to live
without purpose. To be *empty* of motivation.
[Zelkov]
My current purpose is to *safeguard* Princess
Ivy. But that is only until peace has been won.
[Zelkov]
That is why I require a *failsafe*─a secondary
purpose in which to find meaning.
[Amber]
Whoa. That sounds intense... I mean, I have my
own goals, but I mostly just have fun every day.
[Zelkov]
In that respect, Amber, I *envy* you.
[Amber]
Listen, Zelkov... If you really do lose your
reason for living when the war ends...
[Amber]
Why don't you move to my old hometown?
Y'know, the alpaca hamlet.
[Zelkov]
What *purpose* would that serve?
[Amber]
Are you kidding? With knitting skills like yours,
folks would be throwing money at you.
[Amber]
You could make clothes and decorations out of
alpaca wool and pet actual alpacas all day!
[Zelkov]
I do see a certain...*appeal* in that.
[Amber]
You should definitely visit first. Y'know, get a
feel for things before you put down roots?
[Amber]
My whole family─including me─would
welcome you with open arms and hugs to spare!
[Zelkov]
Very well. I can commit to a *visit,* certainly.
[Zelkov]
Whatever the future may hold, we can have at
least that much to look forward to.
