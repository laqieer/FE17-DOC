(Lava Fields)
Seeking to break the barrier in the 
sky above Elyos, the party hunts 
down a Fell Dragon Shard.

[Veyle] 
Over here! The Fell Dragon Shard is nearby!
[Alear] 
I'm glad you can tell where they are, Veyle. 
I can't really sense them myself.
[Veyle] 
Hold on, I see people. It looks like...
[Alear] 
Yes. Zephia and Griss.
[Veyle] 
...
[Alear] 
They must be guarding the shard. Are you 
going to be OK?
[Veyle] 
If I'm going to stop Papa, then I can't avoid this.
Sooner or later, I have to face them. Let's go.
[Alear] 
All right.

[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Zephia. Griss.

[Zephia] 1 
[Zephia] 
My lady! We have been awaiting your arrival.
[Veyle] 
...
[Zephia] 
Oh, I see... It's you again.
And from the looks of it, the other Lady Veyle is 
no longer with us. She's...gone?
[Veyle] 
That's right.
[Griss] 
Wormed your way back in, huh? I never 
thought you'd come out on top, defect.
[Alear] 4 

[Alear] 
Stop calling her that. No one will speak that 
way about Veyle ever again.
[Zephia] 
You?!
[Griss] 
Hey! Whoa! What's this? Aren't you dead?
[Alear] 
I have become an Emblem─by the power of all 
the Emblem Rings, so I can save this world.
[Veyle] 
We're here to stop Papa. Both of you, please, 
step out of the way.
[Zephia] 
And let you through? I think not. Lord Sombron 
is opening the portal to other worlds.
We're here to protect this shard. Not even our 
Lady Veyle could command us to step aside.
[Veyle] 
Then you're prepared to die.
[Zephia] 
You mean to kill us, Lady Veyle? Oh, what a 
sad turn of events.
Even after I doted upon you, cared for you, 
as if you were my own.
[Veyle] 
It used to make me happy when you said things 
like that. But I know they're lies...now.
You're just two of Papa's followers. Enemies 
to defeat, that's all.
[Griss] 
Why you singling us out? There were four of us.
[Veyle] 
Mauvier was my knight. Marni too...
I've been told...she died trying to save me.
Why did you kill her? I didn't even get to tell 
her goodbye.
[Zephia] 
I took Marni into my family. I looked after her. 
What did I get in return? Betrayal.
[Veyle] 
How can you call the Four Hounds family? 
Treating them so...viciously.
[Zephia] 
Because I loved them. When children stray, one 
must punish them─or worse, as needed.
[Alear] 
That isn't real love...
[Zephia] 
Oh? Is that right? Then maybe I've never 
known "real love."
I know my own heart and my own thoughts. 
That's all that's important to me.
But we'll never see eye to eye. Not in a 
thousand years.
I serve Lord Sombron.
I've done so for a very long time, fully 
committed to anything he needs.
[Griss] 
I got no plans to switch sides. Not even if 
we lose. Got it?
[Veyle] 
I see. I suppose this is goodbye, then.
I'm sorry to say, we've got no other choice 
but to fight them.
[Alear] 
Are you sure?
[Veyle] 
They're not listening. If only they would leave 
for their own sakes, but they want to fight.
We need to stop Papa. That means I have to 
put them behind me. It's...about time I do.

[Zephia] 1 
[Zephia] 
Heh... I suppose you've won. I'm sorry, 
Lord Sombron.
[Alear] 
The battle is over. We should go.
[Veyle] 
Goodbye, Zephia. Goodbye, Griss. I'm glad 
I could say that properly this time.
[Zephia] 
Oh, Griss can't hear anything now.
But don't worry. I'll tell him on the other side.
[Veyle] 
Thank you.
[Zephia] 
Ngh...
One last thing, before I go... You won't be able 
to break the next Fell Dragon Shard.
[Veyle] 
What do you mean?
[Zephia] 
Well, it used to be in the mountains.
Gradlon rose so mightily. But those mountains 
crumbled. That spot is now under a lake.
Reaching the shard would be difficult, and 
then destroying it? Surely impossible.
[Alear] 
It's at the bottom of a lake?!
[Veyle] 
I did sense that one of them was weaker and 
farther away than the others.
But I never imagined this...
[Alear] 
What do we do now?
[Zephia] 
Simple. You raise the mountains. Or drain 
the lake.
Please, take this, an enchanted crystal that 
will bring that location...in reach.
[Veyle] 
How did you get this?
[Zephia] 
I am a Mage Dragon. My kind are capable of 
making magical objects...
Small charms and such, you understand. But 
magic of this magnitude...that drains our years.
To craft an object that would alter the very 
terrain around you...I've paid a steep price.
[Veyle] 
Zephia, you don't mean...
[Zephia] 
Yes, it's making this crystal that has led to my 
end. The magic, in exchange for my life.
[Veyle] 
...
[Zephia] 
You two were quite fortunate, you know.
Of all the Mage Dragons that ever were, only 
I am powerful enough to create this.
I learned at the youngest age that I had vast 
powers that were...difficult to control.
I would control them, in time, but not before 
my mother, father, and many others, died.
Oh, memories... Back to the here and now... 
My very powerful gift.
[Veyle] 
Why are you helping us now?
[Zephia] 
Hah...I'm not sure of that myself.
Perhaps here at the close, I'm feeling that it's 
just the right thing to do.
The crystal's enchantment will last for only a 
few hours. So, hurry along. The shard awaits.
Do be careful, Lady Veyle. I'll pray for your 
good fortune in the battles ahead.
[Veyle] 
You─ You could have done this at any time! 
Any time at all!
But now you're dying! We could have made 
things right!
If only you'd told us any of this before we 
fought, maybe we could have forgiven...
[Zephia] 
Why now, indeed? Because it is the end.
[Veyle] 
Huh?
[Zephia] 
I can be kind, just this once, because it's too 
late for me to make things right.
Had I done any of this earlier, would you have 
really forgiven me? We, allies? Heh, nonsense.
I had no intention of dying today, but then all 
this happened. So, I made you a crystal.
I doubt any of you could swim to that shard. 
It's a long, long way down.
[Veyle] 
...
Zephia, I... I don't understand you.
[Zephia] 
Some advice, dear. Leave those you cannot 
understand behind─forget them entirely.
It's just unsettling to let someone like that 
linger in your thoughts as you grow older.
[Veyle] 
Once we defeat Papa, and peace arrives...
I won't forget you, Zephia. No matter how many 
hundreds or thousands of years may pass.
[Zephia] 
Oh, child... No more of that, please. Hurry 
off to that shard.
Unless you prefer to stay and watch me die. 
Would that make you feel safer?
[Veyle] 
...
[Alear] 
Let's go, Veyle.
[Zephia] 
Yes, go. We can at least end things with 
a clean slate.
Goodbye, Lady Veyle. And to you, our new 
Emblem, .
[Alear] 
Goodbye.
[Veyle] 
Goodbye, Zephia.
...
Thank you...for everything.
[Zephia] 
You are too kind, child.

[Griss] 
Hell of a time to switch sides.
[Zephia] 
My word. I thought they had killed you.
[Griss] 
What, you think I'm gonna kick off in the middle of this once-in-a- 
lifetime pain? This is the good stuff. I gotta savor every last drop.
Woulda been real ticked off if they'd put me out 
of my misery, not gonna lie...
[Zephia] 
That's really the reason you were playing dead? 
Even at the end...you're an odd man.
[Griss] 
How come...you told 'em about the shard?
[Zephia] 
Like I said. I'm just trying to wipe the slate clean.
[Griss] 
Cut that out. I wanna know the truth, OK?
[Zephia] 
To get back at Lord Sombron, I guess. Why should 
I die in the dust, while he...
While he gets everything he wanted, just like that. 
Does that seem fair?
Now that they know about the shard, they're sure to break it... 
and he'll know I've met my end─that he's lost me forever.
[Griss] 
You gotta really love somebody...if you wanna hurt 
'em that badly.
[Zephia] 
I wasn't in love with Lord Sombron. I just wanted 
him to give me a child of my own.
That was the dream I clung to through all of the long 
years. A family. The love of a daughter or a son...
When I called the Hounds my family, I meant 
every word of it.
What we had was something very rare, indeed.
You, me, Marni, Mauvier. Working together to 
protect Lord Sombron and Lady Veyle.
[Griss] 
But it's too late for all that now...
If you were gonna turn on Sombron, why'd ya wait? 
If you'd done it sooner, maybe we'd still be together.
And maybe I wouldn't find myself bleeding out 
at the moment.
[Zephia] 
I have to wonder if you'd have been happier on 
the other side.
[Griss] 
You really think I would just abandon you? 
Not a chance in hell.
[Zephia] 
Huh?
[Griss] 
The Four Hounds, a family...
[Griss] 
I always did like the sound of that.
I can't even remember what my parents' faces looked 
like. You're the closest thing I had to a mother.
Ever since the first day you met me, poor little Twisted 
Disciple that I was...hoping that my suffering would 
be good enough in the eyes of Lord Sombron.
You were like a mom to me. And a big sister. Honestly, 
even a god. The most important person in the world to me.
[Zephia] 
Griss...I don't like this joke.
[Griss] 
It's no joke. I'd follow you anywhere...dummy.
[Zephia] 
You're right. How could I have been so blind?
[Zephia] 
The one thing I always wanted...staring me in the 
face all the while.
If only I had realized...
But no. It's too late to think of that.
I hope you forgive me. We are...a family.
I thank you, Griss.
...
[Zephia] 
[Griss] 
Zephia?
You drifted off already?
Guess I will...too.
No reason to stick around without her...
Nothing hurts me...anymore.

You see me and you think of Papa. Or that 
other me.
When we met, you seemed so kind. I really 
liked you.

you, at least from the start.

Hounds. Why you're you.

a reward.
