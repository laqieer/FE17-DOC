[Chloé]
This mission is taking so much longer than
I thought.
[Chloé]
By the time I'm done, it'll be too late.
[Framme]
What's the rush, Chloé? Ooh, do you have a hot
date tonight?!
[Chloé]
Nope. There's this folk-food stall I was hoping
to visit.
[Framme]
A folk-food stall?
[Chloé]
Yeah. I have a thing for local foods made with
unusual ingredients.
[Chloé]
But the shops that sold them were already rare,
and the war has made them almost nonexistent.
[Chloé]
I'd heard there was a food stall opening today,
so I was hoping to check it out.
[Framme]
If it's that important to you, I can go in your
place. I'll be your personal shopper!
[Chloé]
You'd do that for me?
[Framme]
Sure! I'm not so busy that I can't make a slight
detour on the errands I was running anyway.
[Chloé]
Whoa, thanks! I think I'll take you up on that.
[Framme]
So, what can I get for you?
[Chloé]
It's roasted snake meat between two buns.
They call it a snake sandwich!
[Framme]
Wh─ Why would anyone...
[Chloé]
Folk food is always tied to local traditions.
[Chloé]
Eating it is like taking a bite of history. That's
what makes it so great.
[Framme]
Oh... Huh. I think that makes sense...from a
certain point of view.
[Framme]
Anyway, I'll be back in two shakes with your
sandwich of snakes!
[Chloé]
Here's some money. Buy one for yourself, too,
so we can eat them together!

[Framme]
One snake sandwich, as requested!
Here you go.
[Chloé]
Thanks! I'm gonna try it right now.
[Chloé]
...
[Chloé]
What a sandwich! The fluffy bread lulls you in,
and then crunch! The roasted snake hits you!
[Chloé]
It's a flavor cascade from the first bite. Twelve
out of ten.
[Framme]
Yay! I'm so glad you like it.
[Chloé]
What the?!
[Chloé]
There's something slightly off about this...
[Framme]
Huh?
[Chloé]
Are you sure this is a snake sandwich?
[Framme]
Sure, I'm sure. Look, you can see the roast
snake right there, yeah?
[Chloé]
No. It's close, but it's not snake.
[Chloé]
I think it's actually...eel?
[Framme]
Ah! I think you're right...
[Framme]
I'm so sorry! I remember now... The snake
sandwich stall was next to the eel stall.
[Chloé]
Oh, so you went to the wrong one?
Aw, Framme.
[Framme]
This is just the kind of screwup I keep making
as Steward of the Dragon too. I'm real sorry.
[Chloé]
Don't worry about it. Even if it's eel and not
snake, my rating stands.
[Chloé]
Here, try for yourself.
[Framme]
OK. Here goes...
[Framme]
What the heck? Has eel always been this good?!
[Chloé]
That's what I'm saying. It's like I'm tasting it for
the first time. The true appeal of eel.
[Chloé]
Oh, that reminds me. I heard about another new
food stall opening up soon.
[Chloé]
If you don't mind, could I ask you to go buy me
some more eel dishes?
[Framme]
I'm on it! And this time, I'll definitely get your
order right.

[Framme]
OK, I'm back. And I brought fried eel.
[Chloé]
Nice. Ooh, they cut it into little bite-sized
chunks too.
[Chloé]
Time to give it the ol' taste test!
[Framme]
Go for it!
[Chloé]
Mmm, these are good. There's a nice softness
to the inside once you get past the outer crust.
[Chloé]
Hm?
[Chloé]
Oh.
[Framme]
What's up? Oh no, don't tell me...
[Chloé]
This isn't eel.
[Framme]
Aww! I'm so, so, so sorry!
[Chloé]
So, uh, what am I eating?
[Framme]
I just checked the receipt, and it's...fried bugs.
[Chloé]
Bugs?!
[Chloé]
Oh...
[Chloé]
That's amazing! I had no idea bugs could be
so delicious.
[Framme]
Are you─ You're really OK with that?!
[Chloé]
Hm? Well, sure! It's gonna be tough to stop
myself from eating all of them.
[Framme]
Wow. I thought for sure you'd be mad.
[Chloé]
What's to be mad about? Thanks to you, I've
got a new kind of folk food to look out for.
[Chloé]
If I'd sent anyone else, I'd just be eating the
same old fried eel again.
[Chloé]
I should keep you in mind for the next time I'm
too busy to hit up a new food stall too.
[Framme]
I'd love that! Anything to be helpful.
[Framme]
So, can I take your order for the next time?
[Chloé]
Hmm, what am I in the mood for?
[Chloé]
Wait, what am I saying? The whole point is to
see what you manage to come up with.
[Chloé]
Finding out what you somehow bring me is half
the fun. Who knows what I'll end up eating next!
[Framme]
Hahaha, thanks! Here's to more mystery meals!
