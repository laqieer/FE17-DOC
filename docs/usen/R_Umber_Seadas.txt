[Seadall]
What? Really? Here? Am I...reading this right?
[Amber]
Seadall! What's going on? Is everything OK?
[Seadall]
Just doing a bit of fortune telling. The cards say
that a man foretold by legend will soon appear.
[Amber]
Whoa! A man foretold by legend? Where?
When? What else do the cards say?
[Seadall]
Well, this legendary man is young, gregarious,
energetic...and rather handsome.
[Amber]
Ooh, that profile sounds an awful lot like me.
If only my name was Greg! Man, so close.
[Seadall]
Ah, but he's also a fool.
[Amber]
Oh. That can't be me, then. Heh, poor Greg...
[Seadall]
Hmm... This fabled fellow also has a powerful
connection to a certain animal. The...alpaca?
[Amber]
Alpacas?! No way! That has to be me. I AM the
legendary Greg!
[Seadall]
You're the figure my cards are heralding?
[Amber]
I guess so! But what does that mean? Am I
supposed to do something?
[Seadall]
Well, according the cards, sometime in the near
future, you are going to be a savior.
[Amber]
Whoa! A savior? Me?! That's the best!
[Amber]
How near is this near future going to be?
[Seadall]
Eh, that remains a bit...foggy. But never fear,
I'll give you a shout as soon as things are clear.
[Amber]
Got it. I'll keep my ears perked up and my eyes
pointed in both directions...just like an alpaca!

[Seadall]
Ah, it's the alpaca-loving savior himself.
You made it.
[Amber]
Hmm. I know you mean that, but the way you
say it makes me sound...uncool.
[Seadall]
Well, how's this for cool... According to the
cards, today is the day you become a savior!
[Amber]
Really? Today?! That's great!
[Amber]
So, uh...what should I do?
[Seadall]
Make it rain.
[Amber]
Hah, uh...
[Amber]
Make it rain? Like, actual rain? From the sky?
How do I do that?
[Seadall]
That...I do not know. I'm not the savior. You are.
[Amber]
Oh, come on! You can't just make rain happen.
[Seadall]
Look, if you're the savior of legend, then you
should be able to do it. So sayeth the cards.
[Amber]
Wow. The cards really believe in me that much?
I can't let them down.
[Amber]
Right. OK. No big deal. I'm a legendary savior.
I already have everything I need to make it rain.
[Amber]
...
[Amber]
Ain-ray... Ain-ray... Ain-ray...
[Seadall]
OK...
[Amber]
Ain-ray, all-fay own-day ow-nay...ease-play?
[Seadall]
I have never heard this...um...spell before.
[Amber]
Alpaca! You'll 'paca! Everyone will 'paca...
for rain, rain, raaain!
[Amber]
Whoaaa, RAIN!
[Seadall]
Oh boy.
[Amber]
How was that? Is it raining yet?
[Seadall]
Not a single drop.
[Amber]
Oh, come on!
[Seadall]
I guess...the fortune was off. I'm sorry.
I thought I had it right.
[Amber]
No, you're fine. I'm the one who just made a
fool of himself. Tell your cards I'm sorry...

[Seadall]
Amber, can I have a word with you?
[Amber]
Oh, Seadall. Sorry, but I kind of want to be
alone for a while.
[Amber]
I'm still pretty embarrassed about that whole
"rain savior" thing. I really am a fool.
[Seadall]
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
It rained. You're a savior after all!
[Amber]
Uh...
[Amber]
Whoa.
[Amber]
Wait, no! I was there. I did all that stuff and it
didn't rain a single drop!
[Amber]
I appreciate you trying to make me feel better...
[Amber]
But that kind of coddling just makes me feel like
even more of a fool.
[Seadall]
I wouldn't do that. I'm telling you, Amber... You
made it rainâ”€just like the cards said you would.
[Seadall]
It didn't rain right where we were standing, but
it did rain in a village just a few miles away.
[Amber]
It did?!
[Seadall]
It hadn't rained there for ages. In fact, the crops
were on the verge of turning to dust.
[Seadall]
Then all of a sudden, it started pouring.
[Seadall]
I'm telling you, it happened right after you
finished that weird rain chant of yours.
[Amber]
Whoa. What? No. Really? I did that? Really?!
[Amber]
I did it! I'm the legendary savior of some
village somewhere!
[Amber]
I'm so...happy. Saving people is the best feeling
in the entire world.
[Seadall]
When the fighting settles down, how about we
pay a visit to that village? I'll introduce you.
[Seadall]
"Hear ye, humble townsfolk. Come, meet your
alpaca-loving savior!" Yep, that's what I'll say.
[Amber]
No, don't say it like that! You're making me
sound uncool again.
[Seadall]
Don't worry. I promise to properly introduce
the "man foretold by legend." You deserve it.
[Amber]
Yes! And when you do, I'll thank the genius
fortune-teller that predicted me!
[Seadall]
Haha, now it's my turn to be embarrassed.
[Amber]
We make a pretty good duo, y'know?
[Seadall]
I don't think we have a choice. According to
my latest reading, we're destined to be friends.
[Amber]
Hah! Man, those cards are so smart.
[Amber]
Here's to a budding friendship. Nothing's gonna
rain on our parade! Uh, unless I make it, that is.
