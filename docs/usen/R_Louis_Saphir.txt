[Louis]
Hello, Saphir. Would you like to join me for tea?
[Saphir]
Tea? Yeah... No, thanks.
[Saphir]
I'm not the best company for small talk right
now. Better find someone else.
[Louis]
You do seem more solemn than usual today.
[Saphir]
You noticed that...and invited me anyway. Why?
[Louis]
Well, tea can be quite soothing, you know.
[Saphir]
Hahaha, or maybe you're just nosy.
[Saphir]
Still...thanks. For noticing, I mean.
[Louis]
What is on your mind, exactly?
[Saphir]
Nothing important.
[Saphir]
I...didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Bad dream.
[Louis]
How dreadful.
[Saphir]
Feels ridiculous saying it out loud. I'm not a kid
anymore. Shouldn't be bothered by nightmares.
[Louis]
Not so. Even the strongest among us can be
greatly troubled by them.
[Saphir]
Maybe you're right.
[Louis]
Are you sure you wouldn't like me to put on
some nice, warm tea?
[Louis]
It may not drive away your nightmares, but it
could ease your mind somewhat.
[Saphir]
When you put it like that, I guess I may as well
accept your invitation.
[Louis]
As I hoped you would.

[Saphir]
...
[Saphir]
Gotta say, Louis...
[Saphir]
I didn't expect a cup of tea to put me so at ease.
Weirdly enough, though, it has.
[Louis]
I'm pleased to hear it. I'd be delighted to make
tea for you anytime you wish.
[Saphir]
Appreciate it.
[Saphir]
...
[Louis]
Another sleepless night?
[Saphir]
Yeah. I've got this recurring nightmare.
[Saphir]
Reliving the time my parents and best friend
were...killed in front of me.
[Louis]
...
[Saphir]
Soldiers from Elusia attacked the fishing village
I grew up in. I was just a kid.
[Saphir]
It happened decades ago, but I can still see it
like it was yesterday.
[Saphir]
I hoped it would fade as I got older. Or get
easier to deal with as I got stronger.
[Saphir]
Neither has panned out. I'm starting to think I'll
be stuck with that memory forever.
[Louis]
This cannot be easy for you. I offer my
deepest sympathies.
[Saphir]
Nice of you to say, considering how awkward
I've made your teatime.
[Louis]
Not at all, Saphir. Feel free to talk to me about
anything you like.
[Louis]
Alas, all I can do in return is listen and pour
the tea.
[Saphir]
That'll do just fine. Thanks, Louis.

[Saphir]
Oh wow.
[Saphir]
This tea takes me back. Something about the
taste, the smell... It's so familiar.
[Louis]
That is because I looked into what sorts of teas
are popular around your hometown.
[Saphir]
That explains it. But why go to the trouble?
[Saphir]
It's not like this tea's anything special compared
to what you can get in Firene.
[Louis]
You carry with you painful memories that never
fade, though you dearly wish they would.
[Louis]
I have seen you struggle with these memories
time and time again.
[Louis]
Now, I cannot banish them for you. I haven't
that sort of power.
[Louis]
I suspect that no one does.
[Louis]
But lately, I had a thought...
[Louis]
Painful memories are not the only ones that
can be tenacious.
[Saphir]
I see what you're getting at. And you might
be onto something.
[Saphir]
As soon as I tasted this tea, so many memories
came rushing back.
[Saphir]
A field my friend and I raced through. The trees
we sat under to talk and trade dreams.
[Saphir]
My father, sailing off to fish. My mother's face
while cooking dinner. Three of us at the table...
[Saphir]
Happy times. I'd almost forgotten them, but...
They've always been there, haven't they?
[Louis]
Just so.
[Saphir]
Maybe that's what I'll dream tonight. If I do, it'll
be thanks to you.
[Louis]
I am glad to have been of service.
[Saphir]
Something else to think about, Louis.
[Saphir]
These happy memories we've made together
will stick with me forever too.
[Louis]
I believe my memories of you will be equally
long-lasting, Saphir.
