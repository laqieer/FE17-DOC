Am I...really allowed in here?


This is a really beautiful room.
I've got to be careful not to drop this potion.
If it stained, I don't know what I'dâ”€ Ah!


Oh! I almost dropped this potion on you!
Um... Good morning.
I'm really sorry I woke you up like that.


Oh, good. You're already awake.
Morning, Divine One.

I heard the Divine Dragon won't wake up...
So much sleep might hint at a medical issue.


Hmm, doesn't look injured, or ill...
But you can't see most illnesses from 
the outside.
The Divine Dragon is so important, it's easy 
to worry.


You're awake.
Do you feel healthy?
That's good.
If you ever feel lousy, call me. Immediately.


Good morning.
You look healthy.
I was a little worried.
But I'm really sorry I woke you up.

Waking up the Divine Dragon...
gives me a chance for a checkup.


Divine One?
Hmm... Not waking up quickly.
Must be really tired.
I'll make some tea to help with recovery 
from fatigue.


Oh, you're awake, Divine One.
You've been working hard lately.
I'll make you some delicious tea. It's a specialty 
from my hometown...
so just relax while I brew it.


You woke up quickly this morning.
Your color's good, eyes focused, bed head 
minimal. Very healthy!
And as long as you're healthy, I'm happy.

Pretty good harvest of medicinal herbs 
this morning...


Herbs that are good for the skin, or help eyes 
to focus, or keep hair colorful...
There's even some to help you get more rest...
Hmm, what would happen if I administered 
those to the Divine Dragon?


I wasn't doing anything! At all!
Good morning, Divine One.
Ooo, really nice weather we're having, huh? 
Well...anyway!


Sorry my wake up was late today.
But herbs picked at dawn are more effective.
So I wanted to gather them.
Would you like some?

Divine One, there's something I want to talk 
to you about regarding herbs. Oh, asleep, eh?


This new potion comes in five flavors.
There's sweet, sour, bitter, salty-sweet...
And the last one is...salty. Why salty?


Hey, Divine One.
What flavor would you like for my next potion?
I always prefer sweet, so I figured you...
Oh... Salty? Really?


Sorry for waking you.
I was off to get hold of a new medicine.
So I thought I'd ask...
if there was anything you wanted while 
I was out.

Divine One, how is your injury from before?


There's not even a scar...
I'm relieved, but I'll still need to make sure you 
don't push yourself too hard again.
I'll see what I can do.


Remember those medicinal herbs you picked?
My parents wrote to say they were really useful 
to the village.
They said to thank you too.


I've come to examine your injury...
from when you were picking herbs for me.
It looks to be healing nicely. Good.
Thank you so much for helping me out.

Divine One, it's morning.
Thank you for your faith in me, and for trusting 
me to help.


The Pact Ring makes me so happy.
Putting all this trust in me, even though I'm 
still young.
It makes me want to show you how much I 
can accomplish.
I'll become a doctor, and save people's lives, 
and...
make it so everyone you love...
will live for a hundred years.


Did you hear me just now?
Of course I'm planning on living even longer 
than a hundred years.
So I hope we'll still see each other...
even when I'm an old grandpa.


Good morning. Even coming here to wake you...
feels totally different from before.
Your offer of the Pact Ring made me very happy.
I'm really proud I have your trust.


--- S2 ---

I heard you were injured. Where? Show me.


Ah, fast asleep.
Phew, I'm glad it was just a misunderstanding.
Still, it's really good that everyone comes to me 
about the Divine Dragon's health.
Oh... I wonder if that means they all know 
about the Pact Ring?
I never bragged, not even once...
But it's pretty great to know other people 
noticed my work for the Divine Dragon.


Good morning. Did you sleep well?
Ah, that's good.
As long as you always get a good night's sleep...
and keep on being healthy...
I'll be very happy.


Oh, I see.
I'm glad you're not hurt.
I brought a lot of different medicines with me, 
just in case.
But not having to use them on you?
Huge relief.
