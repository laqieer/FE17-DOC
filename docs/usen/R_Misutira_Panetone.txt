=== Timerra & Panette ===

[Timerra]
Ah, that was just what I needed. It's been way
too long since we rode together.
[Panette]
Yes, Boss. Nothing beats a nice jaunt
on wolfback.
[Timerra]
You and I used to go riding practically every
night. What happened to those days?
[Panette]
War happened. The world has changed,
unfortunately.
[Timerra]
Isn't that the truth. And you know, you've
mellowed out a lot since those days.
[Panette]
What do you mean by that?
[Timerra]
Oh, come on! Remember how we met?
[Timerra]
You had a bunch of bandits tied to trees and
were about to feed them to the wolves.
[Panette]
That was merely to intimidate them! I wasn't
actually going to─
[Timerra]
And don't get me started on the way you used
to talk. You'd say things like...
[Timerra]
"Feeling hungry, punks? I got a fresh serving of
knuckles for you right here!"
[Panette]
Why, I beg you to cease this coarse impression.
[Timerra]
Hehe!
[Timerra]
Don't worry, Panette. I loved the old you, but
I love the new you too.
[Panette]
The feeling is mutual, Boss. Your relentless
teasing aside.

[Panette]
Boss, when you said I had changed...you were
right. I have.
[Panette]
But for that, I have you to blame.
[Timerra]
Me?
[Panette]
Yes. When we met, I was wild as they come.
[Panette]
My home life was...rocky, to say the least, and
that left me filled with anger.
[Panette]
So each day, I would go into town and pick
fights with anyone who got on my nerves.
[Panette]
Looking back on that time now, I see how
pointless it was.
[Panette]
Yet that was the only way I knew to cope...until
I met you.
[Panette]
Though at first, of course, I assumed you were
as wild as I was.
[Timerra]
Hehe, we hit it off right away, huh?
[Timerra]
Taking out goons by day, riding our wolves
by night...
[Panette]
Yes. We were thick as thieves.
[Panette]
Little by little, you helped point my rage in a
more...useful direction.
[Timerra]
At men who cut you in line.
[Panette]
That only happened once. I was talking about
all the bandits and thieves we fought.
[Panette]
You taught me to take all my pent-up,
directionless anger and use it for good.
[Timerra]
Well, I'm glad. Though to be honest, that wasn't
really intentional.
[Panette]
Yes, I figured as much.
[Panette]
Even so, if I had never met you...
[Panette]
that rage might have swallowed me whole and
spit out a lonely, resentful husk.
[Panette]
I could have wasted my life feeling bitter about
the hand I was dealt.

[Timerra]
Panette, you said that without me, you would
have spent your whole life lonely and resentful.
[Timerra]
But I don't think that's true.
[Panette]
What makes you say that, Boss?
[Timerra]
Well, you were wild, sure. But your kindness
always shone through.
[Timerra]
Even when we fought the worst of the worst,
you didn't try to hurt them─just stop them.
[Timerra]
And after our long, late-night rides? You took
time to feed the wolves, brush their fur...
[Timerra]
The truth is, I didn't swoop in and put you on
the right path. You were already there.
[Panette]
Do you really think that?
[Timerra]
Of course. I knew you were a good person.
That's why I asked you to become my retainer.
[Panette]
Huh, I remember that day. How surprised I was.
I never suspected you were the princess.
[Timerra]
You weren't convinced by the princess-like way
I begged you? "Pretty please, be my retainer!"
[Panette]
It just seemed absurd that a royal would want
anything to do with a wild girl like me.
[Timerra]
Well, I'm glad you agreed in the end. Thanks
again for that, Panette.
[Panette]
Boss, please. It is I who should be thanking you.
[Timerra]
Oh, come on. You think I don't know how hard
you've worked?
[Timerra]
I know you were worried about embarrassing
me or being rude to my family.
[Timerra]
The rules of royal life are complicated and...and
arbitrary, sometimes, if we're being honest.
[Timerra]
But you took time to study the proper speech
and conduct of a retainer.
[Panette]
It was the least I could do to repay your
generosity.
[Timerra]
Panette, I want you to know something.
[Timerra]
I will become a queen worthy of your efforts.
[Timerra]
A queen you can feel proud to serve.
[Panette]
I have no doubt. And for my part, I shall
continue to serve you with the utmost zeal.
