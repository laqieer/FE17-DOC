=== Lyn & Alfred ===

--- C ---




[Alfred]
I didn't expect there to be an Emblem like you
in Elusia. I think we'll get along famously.
[Lyn]
True, I may seem like a different type of noble,
but I agree that we will find a common ground.

--- B ---




[Alfred]
Morning, Lyn! Smell that fresh, dewy air!
[Lyn]
Wait, it's not even dawn. You have to let the
night finish before you can say "good morning."

--- A ---




[Lyn]
I'm an early riser too, so I think you were right
when you said we're a lot alike.
[Alfred]
Hahaha, you really think so? I knew it!
[Alfred]
What do you say we work out together? I bet
you could get pretty buff with my routine!
[Lyn]
I don't think I can put on any more muscle, but
it sounds fun, so...why not?

=== Lyn & Anna ===

--- C ---




[Anna]
Step right up! All sorts of rare goods in one
place for your buying pleasure! What'll it be?
[Lyn]
Hmm. I know your face, don't I? No, there's
no way. I must be imagining things.

--- B ---




[Lyn]
I appreciate that you keep up the sales pitch,
even to an Emblem. Alas, I have no money.
[Anna]
Hey, no problem. If you don't have hard
currency, I'd accept working the price off.

--- A ---




[Anna]
Have you given any thought to working in my
shop? I'd make it worth your while!
[Lyn]
What would I do? Sales? Security? If we were
being robbed, I could only yell at the thief.
[Anna]
Au contraire! One mean look from you is worth
a dozen hired brutes.
[Lyn]
Do you think so? Still, the answer is no. It's you
who makes this shop work, and no one else.

=== Lyn & Bunet ===

--- C ---




[Bunet]
You have an air of earthiness about you, Lyn.
If you were a food, you would be...a garnish.
[Lyn]
A garnish? Me? Bunet, I haven't the slightest
idea what you're talking about.

--- B ---




[Bunet]
As a chef, I'm keenly aware of flavors as well as
colors. And you, Lyn, could use more red.
[Lyn]
Do you think so? I should think garnishes come
in many different colors.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
Is something wrong, Bunet? I've noticed you
staring off into space quite a bit as of late.
[Bunet]
I've been thinking... What if everything in the
world is just an ingredient in one giant dish?
[Lyn]
Well, I have no form, so I can't be an ingredient.
The same goes for the sky, wind, and clouds.
[Bunet]
I suppose the sun and stars are not ingredients
either, then. Yes, I see now. Thank you, Lyn.

=== Lyn & Boucheron ===

--- C ---





[Boucheron]
I'm really enjoying our journey. Wherever we go,
my friends keep me from getting lost.
[Lyn]
It's nice, isn't it─not having to put on a brave
face. You can simply enjoy yourself.

--- B ---





[Boucheron]
I love reading stories. If there are any you could
share with me, I'm all ears.
[Lyn]
I do have one story I could tell you, it's about all
the amazing things I experienced on my journey.

--- A ---





[Boucheron]
I'm still sniffling over that story you told
me, Lyn!
[Boucheron]
I've decided that I'm going to do great things
too, just like you.
[Lyn]
Thanks for listening. And I'd say it's good to
have a goal.
[Lyn]
Truth is stranger than fiction, after all. I bet your
journey will be more thrilling than any story.

=== Lyn & Céline ===

--- C ---





[Céline]
I've steeled myself to fight for peace, but I fear
sometimes that this war will never end.
[Lyn]
Everything ends, one way or another. I know
you're nervous, but don't lose faith.

--- B ---





[Céline]
I cannot help but envy you, Lyn. Your life seems
so free, so unrestrained.
[Lyn]
Freedom goes hand in hand with danger. But I
know some freedoms are worth the risk.

--- A ---





[Céline]
Thank you for taking tea with me. I always find
great joy in our chats.
[Lyn]
So do I. We'll do this again soon, I hope.
[Céline]
Of course. Hearing tales of your world makes
me reconsider my own approach to life.
[Lyn]
Meanwhile, I'm learning a lot about tea. There's
so much beyond the plains I never knew.

=== Lyn & Chloé ===

--- C ---




[Chloé]
I wonder what kind of food we'll find in the next
town. Do you have any favorite foods, Lyn?
[Lyn]
Good question. Meatballs, boar-meat dumplings,
sausage... Most kinds of meat, I suppose.

--- B ---




[Lyn]
You're always eating the juiciest-looking things.
My mouth would water if it could.
[Chloé]
They're all so good! I wish I could sample some
things from your world too.

--- A ---




[Chloé]
Hey, Lyn! Look what I got─it's gecko rolled in
pepper and fried in frog oil.
[Lyn]
Oh, is that...for me? Oh no. What a shame.
Emblems can't eat food.
[Chloé]
Oh...I'm so sorry. I forgot. Here, I'll describe
every last detail of the taste to you as I eat.
[Lyn]
Every detail? No, thank you. Maybe some other
time, when you eat something more common.

=== Lyn & Citrinne ===

--- C ---





[Citrinne]
How can I convince people my face isn't scary?
I try to pay it no mind, but it happens so often...
[Lyn]
Try to guide them out of their initial discomfort.
A confident, steady smile might do the trick!

--- B ---





[Citrinne]
Lyn... I tried to follow your advice about smiling.
People were even more terrified of me!
[Lyn]
Oh, I see. That is a tricky situation. Perhaps you
shouldn't take my advice on this one...

--- A ---





[Citrinne]
Wonderful news, Lyn! I've found a way to not
be upset by frightened reactions to my face!
[Lyn]
That's much different from your original goal.
I like this one better. How did you do it?
[Citrinne]
I imagine that the other person is merely acting
scared of my face. As a joke. And jokes are fun!
[Lyn]
If it works, it works. I don't think you have to
worry. You're kind, and everyone knows it.

=== Lyn & Clanne ===

--- C ---




[Lyn]
Clanne, you look sad. Are your chores getting
to you?
[Clanne]
Nope, I love doing chores for the Divine Dragon.
In fact, I'm worried I might run out.

--- B ---




[Lyn]
You look a little down. Is there something you'd
like to talk about?
[Clanne]
I miss my parents. Is that weird? Right now
should be a happy time, not a sad one.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
I was born on the plains, and I've always missed
them since I left.
[Clanne]
You get that way too? Wow, I do feel better.
I thought I might be pathetic.
[Lyn]
No, it just means we love where we came from.
When you can, go and visit your parents.
[Clanne]
Maybe I will. Right now, though, I can't imagine
being away from the Divine Dragon.

=== Lyn & Diamant ===

--- C ---




[Diamant]
Emblem Lyn... King Hyacinth used your power
to wound and capture my father. I... I can't...
[Lyn]
I understand...and I'm sorry. I was under the Fell
Dragon's power. I know that's of little comfort...

--- B ---




[Diamant]
There's a familiar warmth to your power, Lyn.
Your determination reminds me of my father.
[Lyn]
I'm honored to hear that, Diamant. I take it as a
sign that we're growing to trust each other.

--- A ---




[Diamant]
I apologize for my behavior, Lyn. I strive for
peace, yet I held on to bitterness toward you.
[Lyn]
Don't apologize, Diamant. I understand. If I had
lost someone precious to me, I'd do the same.
[Diamant]
Starting today, I want us to be true comrades in
arms─to fight side by side. Will you accept me?
[Lyn]
Of course! I would enjoy nothing more. We'll be
able to grow much stronger as a team.

=== Lyn & Etie ===

--- C ---





[Etie]
You're so graceful, Lyn. And with a little more
training, you'd have muscles on top of muscles.
[Lyn]
I'm trained in the sword and bow, but I never
thought about muscle training. Interesting idea.

--- B ---




[Lyn]
You're exercising every time I lay eyes on you.
What spurs you to work so hard?
[Etie]
I could get toned, or I could lie around doing
nothing. It's an easy choice.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
Working out is important to you, but I worry
that you might be overdoing it.
[Etie]
Trust me, what looks like too much to you is
just right for me. I know my limits.
[Etie]
Every session, I push them just a little bit
further so I can reach new heights.
[Lyn]
If you say so. I'm not going to stop worrying,
but I trust your ability to overcome anything.

=== Lyn & Fogado ===

--- C ---




[Lyn]
Are you truly a prince? Really? I'm sorry, it's
just I still find it hard to believe.
[Fogado]
Sheesh, when you ask like that, I start to doubt
it myself. I mean, I am the prince of Solm, right?

--- B ---





[Fogado]
I'm not the sort to worry about acting all prince-
like. That's not my thing. Being me is my thing.
[Lyn]
Well, you have a lot of personality. I like it. It's
far better than having too little personality.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
I'm told you pretend to be an ordinary citizen so
you can gather intel. Very clever. I should try it.
[Fogado]
Please. There's no way someone as remarkable
as you could pass for an average person.
[Lyn]
You think I can't blend in? That's funny. You
would stand out in any crowd.
[Fogado]
Oh, I don't know about that. My cover's never
been blown yet.

=== Lyn & Framme ===

--- C ---




[Framme]
You're such a huge help to the Divine Dragon.
Almost as much as me. Almost.
[Lyn]
Your dedication is admirable. I promise, I'll
never come between you and the Divine One.

--- B ---




[Lyn]
Serving the Divine Dragon is hard work. And
yet, you never seem to grow weary of it.
[Framme]
I don't! Doing stuff for the Divine Dragon is
super inspiring. I could keep it up forever.

--- A ---




[Framme]
Dragons live much longer than humans. So, one
day, I'll have to leave the Divine Dragon's side.
[Lyn]
Framme, the more you love someone, the
harder it is to imagine being apart from them.
[Lyn]
But if you spend your time fretting about it,
you won't enjoy the time you have together.
[Framme]
You're right, Lady Lyn. I'm gonna enjoy every
second I have with the Divine Dragon.

=== Lyn & Goldmary ===

--- C ---




[Goldmary]
I envy how cool and intimidating you are in
battle, Lyn. I'm much too charming for all that.
[Lyn]
No shortage of confidence in you, is there?
It's well earned, though. You work hard at it.

--- B ---




[Lyn]
You've refined your technique, Goldmary.
I can't wait to see it in the next battle.
[Goldmary]
Thank you. With my form honed to such elegant
perfection, I won't even need strength training.

--- A ---




[Goldmary]
I've put on a poor performance lately. Graceful
technique just doesn't seem to be enough...
[Lyn]
That's what you get for cutting corners with
your strength training.
[Lyn]
I know you're busy, and training takes up time,
but try to find a routine that works for you.
[Goldmary]
You're right. Shortcuts are not my style anyway.
Will you teach me a good routine?

=== Lyn & Hortensia ===

--- C ---




[Hortensia]
Wow, you're the Emblem from my father's ring?
You're almost as cute as I am...
[Lyn]
That's quite a compliment, considering how
adorable you are.

--- B ---




[Hortensia]
I've been studying you, Emblem Lyn. I'll bet
you've had your share of gentleman callers?
[Lyn]
I've had a few suitors. They disappeared fast
when I challenged them to swordplay, though.

--- A ---




[Hortensia]
Give me some advice, Lyn. How do I get people
absolutely wrapped around my finger?
[Lyn]
Can never get enough attention, can you?
I think you're charming already, but let's see...
[Lyn]
Back home, the popular folks were those who
thought of nature and others before themselves.
[Hortensia]
You make a compelling point. OK, tell me more.

=== Lyn & Ivy ===

--- C ---





[Ivy]
Your ring is something of an heirloom in my
family. I suppose that makes things awkward.
[Lyn]
Not at all. I spent many years in your father's
company. King Hyacinth treated me well.

--- B ---





[Ivy]
I still find it odd to fight alongside a family
heirloom─but I'm glad you're here, Lyn.
[Lyn]
Elusia's royal family has a special place in my
heart. I'm happy to lend you my strength.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
Being an Emblem's not so bad, but at times,
I wish I could wander the world more freely.
[Ivy]
It took leaving my country altogether for me to
realize how much I had been missing.
[Ivy]
I have no easy solution for you. Perhaps we
could take walks together, for a start.
[Lyn]
Oh, that'd be great. Thank you, Ivy. I'm glad
I can confide in you about things like this.

=== Lyn & Jade ===

--- C ---




[Lyn]
Such a stern expression, Jade... If I upset you in
that last battle somehow, you must tell me.
[Jade]
No, you're fine, Lyn. I was just admiring your
smile. It's...very refreshing.

--- B ---





[Jade]
I think laughter is the highest form of human
expression. It's mysterious and profound...
[Lyn]
I can see that you take laughter quite seriously.
Your passion for comedy is inspiring.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
Your novel had me in stitches, Jade! I'm amazed
at how well you hide your humorous side.
[Jade]
I get that a lot. Like you said, I'm always serious
about laughter. Some people think I never laugh.
[Lyn]
Well, I, for one, think I've gotten much better at
reading your happier expressions.
[Jade]
You have? Hmm. You're a funny warrior, Lyn...
but I guess it takes one to know one. Hm.

=== Lyn & Jean ===

--- C ---




[Jean]
Everybody can tell right off that I'm from a
Firenese island by my accent.
[Lyn]
That's nothing to be ashamed of. You should
wear the marks of your homeland proudly.

--- B ---




[Lyn]
I'd never heard an accent like yours before.
I'm taken with its own particular rhythm.
[Jean]
Is that how we sound to outsiders? I'm glad
you think we don't seem silly.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
It's hard imitating someone else's speech. You
can end up making yourself feel unwelcome.
[Jean]
I've tried to mimic the way everyone else talks
too, but I couldn't keep it up.
[Lyn]
It's better that way. The things we can't change
about ourselves are what make us special.
[Jean]
Hmm, I will be helping a lot of people on this
journey. They'll all learn about my home!

=== Lyn & Kagetsu ===

--- C ---




[Lyn]
Hey, Kagetsu. You can see the future, right?
Can you give me a prediction?
[Kagetsu]
Naturally! Let me see... Your homeland will have
lovely weather tomorrow! Take my word for it!

--- B ---




[Kagetsu]
OK, this time I will predict something you can
see yourself. Very soon, you will be frustrated!
[Lyn]
What a strange prediction. How am I supposed
to... Oh, I get it. That was a joke, right?

--- A ---




[Kagetsu]
If you disbelieve my prophetic power, then try
asking me your own question.
[Lyn]
If you insist. You usually predict small details,
right? So, what's for breakfast tomorrow?
[Kagetsu]
Ah. You will soon see that we will be eating...
onigiri! Yes, I love onigiri!
[Lyn]
Sounds more like a plan than a prediction. Or
maybe you're just seeing what you want to see.

=== Lyn & Lapis ===

--- C ---




[Lyn]
I was born on the Sacae Plains. Nature blessed
us with her bounty in every direction.
[Lapis]
Oh! You'd never starve growing up on the
plains. So much plant life to eat. All that grass...

--- B ---




[Lyn]
I think you may have misunderstood me before.
There was more to eat than just the grass...
[Lapis]
Oh, that does make more sense. I guess I was
too eager to relate with someone else...

--- A ---




[Lapis]
Hey, Lyn? Have you ever lost out on something
even though you worked really hard for it?
[Lyn]
I have. Plenty of large animals have slipped
away from me while I was hunting.
[Lyn]
I'd prepare so much, plan for every movement...
and then it would just vanish. So frustrating.
[Lapis]
Heh, I guess you have to seize the moment
sometimes. I'll learn from your lesson, Lyn!

=== Lyn & Lindon ===

--- C ---





[Lindon]
Magic isn't just for defeating your enemies.
You can create things, cook, and so much more.
[Lyn]
That's interesting. I can't use magic myself, but
hearing you talk about it makes me wish I could.

--- B ---





[Lindon]
It's been so long since I unleashed magic on
people rather than ingredients. I may be rusty.
[Lyn]
You integrated magic into your daily life, huh?
Maybe one day I'll chop food with my blade.

--- A ---





[Lindon]
I'm as rusty as I feared. My magic just isn't
what it once was.
[Lyn]
Don't be absurd. You still contribute on the
front lines. The enemy's mages can't touch you.
[Lindon]
Not so. I'm too used to everyday magic, which
I'm always careful not to use at full power.
[Lyn]
Trust me, no one who sees your "everyday
magic" would imagine you're limiting yourself.

=== Lyn & Louis ===

--- C ---




[Louis]
Apropos of nothing, do you have any friends
with whom you let down your guard?
[Lyn]
The many friends I've fought alongside, for a
start. Or is that not what you meant?

--- B ---




[Lyn]
There was one friend I had called Florina. She
was adorable. We spent so much time together.
[Louis]
Perfect! That's the precise sort of thing I had
hoped for! Please, tell me everything.

--- A ---




[Louis]
There is such warmth in being surrounded by
amiable friends. I'd disappear into it if I could.
[Lyn]
I've never met anyone who enjoyed watching
people get along as much as you do.
[Louis]
Enjoyment comes in all forms, including this
one. Now, shall we find you some new friends?
[Lyn]
Hey! That's my ring! How many people do you
plan on introducing me to?!

=== Lyn & Alear ===

--- C ---




[Lyn]
Don't go thinking I'm some wishy-washy noble.
I'm stronger than I look.
[Alear]
I never thought you seemed weak to begin with.
I'd be nowhere without you, Lyn!

--- B ---




[Lyn]
This is a good world. Though it makes me miss
the green, rolling plains of my home.
[Alear]
They sound beautiful. It would be nice if I could
see them for myself someday.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
You look tired. If there's something dragging
you down, you can tell me. I'm a good listener.
[Alear]
I still hesitate sometimes in battle because I'm
so inexperienced.
[Alear]
Then I second-guess myself afterward, thinking
of all the things I should have done instead.
[Lyn]
Don't worry about making mistakes. You have
friends─and me─to guide you through them.

=== Lyn & Mauvier ===

--- C ---




[Mauvier]
You have an air of freedom about you. I admit
I am jealous.
[Lyn]
You're jealous because you overthink what it
means to have freedom. Loosen up a bit.

--- B ---




[Mauvier]
You're so lively. Always talking with others. I
keep quiet out of fear of being misunderstood.
[Lyn]
If you start sharing your thoughts with others,
there'll be fewer misunderstandings.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
You...don't need to stand at attention when
we talk. Stop being so stiff, and relax a little.
[Mauvier]
Relax... You mean like this?
[Lyn]
Your expression is still a little stiff... You know,
"stiff" just might be who you are. It's great.
[Mauvier]
My humor was unintentional, yet hearing you
laugh does make me happy.

=== Lyn & Merrin ===

--- C ---




[Merrin]
Pardon my saying so, Lady Lyn... I can't help
but feel a sense of rivalry with you.
[Lyn]
Really? I hope that changes with time. I'm
certain we'd make better friends than rivals.

--- B ---




[Merrin]
Lady Lyn, the way you move when you fight─
it's very impressive. I envy you.
[Lyn]
And I envy you and the way you ride that wolf.
How I wish I could ride one across the plains.

--- A ---




[Merrin]
We've been through so many battles together.
We make a very cool duo, don't you think?
[Lyn]
I agree. Our rapport is envied by many, I'm sure.
But what made you think of this?
[Merrin]
Because I think it's time we form an alliance.
The two of us together, we'd be unstoppable.
[Lyn]
An alliance? Yes, I'm in! Just one important
question: which one of us gets to be the leader?

=== Lyn & Timerra ===

--- C ---




[Lyn]
Your dress─it's quite flamboyant for a princess.
Does the entire royal family wear such attire?
[Timerra]
Freedom is kinda our thing, so we wear what
we like. Some flashy colors would suit you too!

--- B ---





[Timerra]
You and me, we should go out and have some
fun. I've even got the perfect outfit for you.
[Lyn]
I'm rather fond of what I'm wearing, but more
importantly...Emblems can't change clothes.

--- A ---





[Timerra]
I hate to say it, but at first, I didn't trust you.
I mean, King Hyacinth controlled you, ya know?
[Timerra]
But after we talked and fought side by side...
What I'm trying to say is, I really like you, Lyn.
[Lyn]
Thank you, Timerra. I really like you too. You're
a princess and yet you're so very genuine.
[Lyn]
We should go out and have fun! We can pretend
I'm wearing that outfit you chose for me.

=== Lyn & Pandreo ===

--- C ---





[Pandreo]
There's a time for partying and a time for
praying. In my church, we make time for both.
[Lyn]
Partying? I've never heard of such a church.
I bet you're calmer around the Divine Dragon.

--- B ---




[Lyn]
I heard you singing, so I stopped by to listen...
and saw you flailing about so strangely!
[Pandreo]
Oh, that's just my prayer dance. My friends call
it the Dance of Darkness because it's so awful.

--- A ---





[Pandreo]
What if my dancing isn't awful? What if it's just
different from every other dance out there?
[Lyn]
Hmm, a new form of dance... Well, in that case,
wouldn't every human movement be a dance?
[Pandreo]
Yes, exactly! We're all nonstop dancing and
praying, each in our own way. And it's all good!
[Lyn]
What a lovely idea, Pandreo. Next time I watch
you dance, I'll see it for how beautiful it truly is.

=== Lyn & Panette ===

--- C ---





[Panette]
How is it that everyone finds insects and ghosts
so frightening? I find them quite adorable.
[Lyn]
I myself am not scared of them. But I must ask,
how do you know ghosts are adorable?

--- B ---




[Lyn]
I know you're fond of ghosts, but is it wise to
push your eerie pastime on everyone you meet?
[Panette]
Ghosts are delightful, I assure you. My true aim
is to test my peer's courage.

--- A ---





[Panette]
Alas, no one is brave enough to hunt for ghosts
with me. Seems it's just the two of us, Lyn.
[Lyn]
The two of us? I don't remember agreeing
to go. I'm not sure I want to meet a ghost.
[Panette]
Odd. You have so much in common with them.
If I don't return, know that I went down fighting.
[Lyn]
You're going? All by yourself? You know I can't
let you do that. You win─I'll be your escort.

=== Lyn & Rosado ===

--- C ---





[Rosado]
I love the way your ponytail swishes around
in combat, Lyn. Like it's dancing!
[Lyn]
Thanks, but you should probably keep your
eyes on more important things in battle.

--- B ---





[Rosado]
Ah, you have such smooth and healthy skin.
What's your secret?
[Lyn]
Exercise, perhaps? I haven't given it
much thought.

--- A ---





[Rosado]
Why are people so obsessed with war? We just
take from each other, over and over.
[Lyn]
It's rare for you to be so serious. Are you
feeling all right?
[Rosado]
Rude! I'm a knight! But imagine what I'd be if
beauty was the world's obsession instead?
[Lyn]
A benevolent ruler, I'd like to think. That would
be an interesting world, to say the least.

=== Lyn & Saphir ===

--- C ---





[Saphir]
We should spar sometime. I feel like we'd be
a good match.
[Lyn]
Agreed. I've fought enough tough opponents
to know you'd be an interesting one.

--- B ---





[Saphir]
So you grew up as a nomad in the plains, huh?
I'll bet you're a better hunter than I am.
[Lyn]
Probably. I'm a complete novice at fishing,
though. You'd have to give me some tips.

--- A ---





[Saphir]
A battle's not so different from a hunt. That's
probably why I've survived so many of both.
[Lyn]
Must have been tough living as a mercenary,
wandering from one battlefield to the next.
[Lyn]
Much as someone like you must thrive in war,
I hope you understand that peace is our goal.
[Saphir]
As a mercenary, I wouldn't have. But I'm a
royal knight now, and I do understand.

=== Lyn & Seadall ===

--- C ---





[Seadall]
You move beautifully in battle. When I watch
you, I see wind blowing across vast plains.
[Lyn]
You're very perceptive, Seadall. You must be
quite gifted to see my homeland like that.

--- B ---





[Seadall]
My patrons haven't been satisfied lately. I dance
then tell their fortunes...but it's not enough.
[Lyn]
No, it's too much. Try telling fortunes for some
and dancing for others. Let each talent shine.

--- A ---





[Seadall]
Lyn, you said I shouldn't dance for people who
simply want their fortunes told.
[Seadall]
But when people are looking for answers, I think
dancing might bring them the joy they seek.
[Lyn]
Hm... Well, you could say their fortune suggests
they seek out a dance performance.
[Lyn]
Seadall, you truly care about your customers.
And one day they will be happy, I know it.

=== Lyn & Alcryst ===

--- C ---





[Alcryst]
You're the Emblem King Hyacinth once used...
but now you're an ally? This is hard to accept.
[Lyn]
Until you can forgive me, Alcryst, think of me
only as an Emblem, not as Lyn.

[Alcryst]
Thank you for lending me your strength, Lyn.
I've come to rely on your power...a lot.
[Lyn]
Thank you, Alcryst. I've come to rely on your
power as well. You're quite skilled!

--- A ---





[Alcryst]
Before...you told me to think you as "only an
Emblem." But...I don't think I can.
[Lyn]
It's still too difficult to fight alongside me? I see.
We'll ask the Divine Dragon if someone else─
[Alcryst]
No! You're not "only" anything. The more we
battle together, the more precious you become.
[Lyn]
Oh! Hm-hm, I'm so glad to hear that, Alcryst.
We should talk more often!

=== Lyn & Amber ===

[Amber]
If we had alpacas on our team, we would never
lose! Think you could help me train a few, Lyn?
[Lyn]
I've never thought of recruiting alpacas. I guess
they could be quite powerful under the fluff...

--- B ---




[Lyn]
Hmm. Strange. I used to think alpacas were odd,
but now I wonder how I missed their charm...
[Amber]
Yeah! Alpacas are the best. They helped me
survive a life in the countryside before this.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
Aww, I wish we had alpacas here... I want to
pet one so badly. What am I saying?
[Amber]
Hahaha! Too late, Lyn. I heard that! You've been
overwhelmed by alpaca power!
[Lyn]
I hate to admit it, but it seems you're right...and
I think I've come to appreciate your power too.
[Amber]
You have? Really?! But you're so much cooler
than me. I'm sorta stunned...but happy too!

=== Lyn & Vander ===

[Vander]
It is wonderful to see you full of energy, yet I
fear you may catch cold in such light clothes.
[Lyn]
No, Vander, I'm fine. I've always worn... Now
that you mention it, can Emblems catch a cold?

--- B ---




[Lyn]
It seems like you'd get tired standing up so
straight all the time. Relax! Smile!
[Vander]
So be it, I shall indulge you. Behold. A smile.
How is that? Better than you expected?

--- A ---





[Vander]
Such times are these. Queen Lumera, gone; the
Divine Dragon, awake; and Lady Lyn beside me.
[Vander]
Life does as it will. I am but a passenger on
this journey.
[Lyn]
A thousand years ago, I never imagined I'd be
awakened from the ring again.
[Lyn]
I think you're right. We're passengers, but we're
also constantly blessed with new experiences.

=== Lyn & Veyle ===

[Lyn]
You look as if you have a lot on your mind,
Veyle. Please, let me know if I can be of help.
[Veyle]
I don't know if I'm worthy of your kindness,
Lyn. But thank you for the offer.

--- B ---





[Veyle]
You're amazing, Lyn. You're so forthright and
sure of yourself. I want to be like that.
[Lyn]
But you are, Veyle. You are living your truth
despite everything stacked against you.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
Nothing can strengthen you more than finding
someone to believe in─someone to trust.
[Veyle]
I think I have. But, Lyn... Do you believe in me?
[Lyn]
I do. I've survived many hard times because of
people like you─people I could put my faith in.
[Veyle]
Thank you, Lyn. I'll do my very best to live up
to the faith and trust you put in me.

=== Lyn & Yunaka ===

[Yunaka]
You're so fierce and gorgeous, Lyn. I don't
know whether to surrender or buy you flowers.
[Lyn]
I have no idea how to respond to that. I'll take
it as a compliment, I think?

--- B ---




[Yunaka]
Your sword's got a wicked edge. Oh, it looks
so deadly. I've gotta try it. Can I?
[Lyn]
I'd love to say yes, but since it lacks a physical
form, you'll have to be satisfied with looking.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
Words have been attributed to me that I didn't
say. Do you know why that might be, Yunaka?
[Yunaka]
That was probably me. I may have done some
impressions of you. It was only for a giggle!
[Lyn]
I knew it. That does it, young lady─no more
impressions! Of anyone! Not even for giggles!
[Yunaka]
No! Come on, I'm sorry! You can forgive me,
can't you?! Friends forgive each other!

=== Lyn & Zelkov ===

[Zelkov]
You grew up on the open plains, did you not?
It must have been *fatally* boring.
[Lyn]
Not at all, actually. Nomads lead exciting lives.
There's always something going on.

--- B ---





[Zelkov]
You always seem so *leisurely.* I find it
rather unsettling.
[Lyn]
A wanderer's at home wherever she goes. If I
show some "leisureliness," that's probably why.

--- A ---




[Lyn]
I wish you could see my homeland. It might
ease your restless search for deeper meaning.
[Zelkov]
The plains? I told you before, I would find
simply staring at nature *fatally* boring.
[Lyn]
What about talking to me? Is that
*fatally* boring?
[Zelkov]
Hm-hm. Interesting point. I admit our
conversations are *sufficiently* entertaining.
