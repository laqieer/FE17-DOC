[Alear] 
There's something...unnatural about this place.
[Sigurd] 
You feel it as well? I've no explanation for it, yet 
this place bears a great resemblance to Chalphy.
[Alear] 
Chalphy? I've never heard of it. Is it somewhere 
in your world?
[Sigurd] 
Correct. It is my homeland.
[Sigurd] 
I had once thought to lead a quiet life there in 
Chalphy, alongside my wife, Deirdre.
[Alear] 
What happened?
[Sigurd] 
Deirdre was kidnapped by followers of a dark 
faith. Her life was twisted to their desires.
[Sigurd] 
She was to aid in the resurrection of a dark god, 
heralding a new age of terror and destruction.
[Alear] 
What? That's awful!
[Sigurd] 
Ah, yet there was still light... Still hope for 
our future.
[Alear] 
How so?
[Sigurd] 
I believe I shall share that part of the tale with 
you following the trial.
[Sigurd] 
Take up your weapon. For I am the trial that 
you shall face, .
[Sigurd] 
Overcome this trial, and our bond will grow. 
My power will become yours.
[Alear] 
And we have to fight in this place that is like 
your homeland... There's significance to that.
[Sigurd] 
Correct. Now earn it. Show me that your skills 
are sufficient to surpass my own!
[Alear] 
I'll take you down, Sigurd. I'm giving this 
everything I have!

[Sigurd] 
Well done. You have passed the trial with a 
stunning display of skill.
[Alear] 
I didn't do it alone. All of us claimed this 
victory together.
[Sigurd] 
Correct. Friends, allies, family... Anyone with 
whom you forge bonds will give you strength.
[Sigurd] 
Now, the moment of truth. Do you wish to 
avenge the death of your mother, Lumera?
[Alear] 
I...
[Alear] 
When I lost her, I was sad...and angry. I thought 
I could never forgive the one who took her life.
[Alear] 
But you asked me if I'd want revenge...and... 
I don't know anymore.
[Sigurd] 
I lost many friends, even family, in battle. 
And yet I find I bear no grudges.
[Sigurd] 
I know well the meaning of grief. As well, I know 
there is no single truth.
[Sigurd] 
I entrusted this knowledge to my son, Seliph. 
I hoped that it might guide his future.
[Alear] 
Your son? You and Deirdre's, you mean?
[Sigurd] 
Indeed. Now listen well. You carry a proud 
and noble conviction in your heart.
[Sigurd] 
Knowing grief, justice, and truth are subjective, 
are you still able to fight with conviction?
[Alear] 
Of course. This war will end, and then I will see 
to it that the world remains at peace.
[Sigurd] 
A perfect answer, my friend...and the one I was 
hoping to hear.
[Sigurd] 
So, until the fighting is done and gone, I shall be 
by your side, watching over you.

If we're going to reach Sigurd, we'll need to 
cross that bridge.
[Alear] 
And if we can capture that fortress, we might 
be able to operate it.

[Alfred] 
The fortress general's dead! The bridge is ours! 
Let's rest a here for a minute, Divine Dragon.

Relax 

[Sigurd] 
On what do you stake your life? Tell me─how 
do you imagine the world once your war ends?
[Alear] t 
[Alear] Strike 

[Alear] 
I wish for a peaceful world─for myself, my 
friends, everyone!
[Alear] 
A world that we will build for ourselves, where 
no one will be hurt by the greed of others.

[Sigurd] 
It requires power to turn a dream into reality. 
Show me you have what it takes.

[Vander] 
This isn't the first time we've locked swords. 
Do you remember training with Queen Lumera?
[Sigurd] b 
[Sigurd] Serious 

[Sigurd] 
Of course. How could I ever allow myself to 
forget? Alas, those days are far behind us.
[Sigurd] 
Angry 

[Sigurd] 
So we must move on, you and I, into the future. 
We shall not allow her wishes to be in vain.
[Vander] Strike 

[Vander] 
You had better be ready, Lord Sigurd! I dedicate 
this strike...to Queen Lumera!
