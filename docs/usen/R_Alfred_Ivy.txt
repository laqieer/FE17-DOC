[Alfred] 
Whatcha doing up so late, Princess Ivy?
[Ivy] 
Prince Alfred!
[Ivy] 
I suppose it must seem rather suspicious for an 
Elusian to be roaming alone after dark.
[Ivy] 
I assure you I have no plans to murder anyone 
or to set anything on fire.
[Ivy] 
Of course, such assurances must mean little 
coming from me.
[Alfred] 
Nah, you don't seem so bad. I'm leaning toward 
trusting you by now.
[Ivy] 
Oh? I am surprised to learn that the crown 
prince of Firene is so naive.
[Alfred] 
If that's what I get for trusting people, then 
naive is my middle name.
[Ivy] 
Hm. So did you need something from me?
[Ivy] 
If you were not here to doubt my motives, 
I would expect you to have left by now.
[Alfred] 
Nah. I wouldn't leave you alone.
[Ivy] 
And why is that?
[Alfred] 
Well, it's pretty plain to see that you're lost.
[Ivy] 
You think so?
[Alfred] 
The Somniel's a big place. Lots of twists and 
turns. It's easy to get confused.
[Ivy] 
Ugh...
[Ivy] 
I do confess I am somewhat lost.
[Alfred] 
If you're going where I think you're going, 
I know the way. Let me help you.
[Ivy] 
Uh...
[Ivy] 
Thank you.

[Alfred] 
Princess Ivy, we've got to stop meeting at 
this hour.
[Ivy] 
Prince Alfred. Is it not past your bedtime?
[Alfred] 
Oh, I'm not up late. I just got up early 
this morning.
[Ivy] 
I am not sure this hour is sufficiently late to 
qualify as early.
[Alfred] 
So what are you still doing up, anyway?
[Ivy] 
I...couldn't sleep.
[Alfred] 
I'd think it would be even harder to sleep 
out here, with it being so bright and all.
[Ivy] 
No, I...prefer it here, actually.
[Alfred] 
Hmm.
[Alfred] 
Strong wind tonight, isn't it?
[Alfred] 
Sounds like a howling ghost, the way it blows 
through the trees.
[Ivy] 
What are you suggesting?
[Alfred] 
You can be straight with me, Princess Ivy. You 
were scared to be alone in your room, huh?
[Ivy] 
How dare you!
[Alfred] 
Hey, there's no shame in it.
[Alfred] 
The wind scared me, too, when I was a kid. I'd 
crawl under the sheets and stay there all night.
[Ivy] 
I am no child!
[Alfred] 
When you get creeped out, think of something 
fun instead. You'll be asleep before you know it!
[Alfred] 
That's what my mother told me. After that, 
I slept like a log every single night.
[Ivy] 
Ugh...
[Ivy] 
I will return to bed. Sleep is restorative to 
one's health, as they say.
[Alfred] 
Nighty night! Don't let the strong wind fright!
[Ivy] 
Thank you.

[Ivy] 
Prince Alfred, do you understand the 
implications of what has occurred between us?
[Alfred] 
Princess Ivy? Can't say that I do.
[Ivy] 
That first night, you helped me find the way 
when I was lost.
[Ivy] 
The second time, you gave me advice on 
how to find peaceful sleep.
[Ivy] 
Much as I am loath to admit it, I am deeply in 
your debt.
[Alfred] 
Haha, and that's bad somehow?
[Ivy] 
Of course it's bad.
[Ivy] 
I am the crown princess of Elusia. I cannot show 
such weakness, especially to a rival nation.
[Ivy] 
Therefore...you must tell me how I can be 
of assistance to you.
[Alfred] 
Oh, so you think it should be your turn to help 
me now, huh?
[Ivy] 
I need to clear this obligation. That's all.
[Alfred] 
Well, I hate to say it, but I'm not in any kind of a 
jam right now.
[Ivy] 
So you won't let me help you?
[Ivy] 
This is unacceptable. I demand that you be 
troubled immediately!
[Alfred] 
Haha, the only thing that's giving me trouble is 
this demand of yours.
[Alfred] 
Look, I don't think of this as a "pay me back 
someday" situation.
[Alfred] 
This is just what allies do!
[Ivy] 
Ugh.
[Alfred] 
When I see you're in a spot, I help out. You 
don't owe me for that. None of my friends do.
[Ivy] 
...
[Ivy] 
You just...trust people?
[Ivy] 
You really are naive.
[Alfred] 
Guilty as charged. But there's a lot of upsides to 
being naive.
[Ivy] 
...
[Ivy] 
I suppose...I can find inspiration in that.
[Ivy] 
Very well. I will trust you.
[Alfred] 
Aww, Princess Ivy. That's great!
[Ivy] 
To be candid, I am glad to have more people 
I can trust now.
[Ivy] 
When I become queen, it will be a relief to know 
that at least one of my peers is trustworthy.
[Ivy] 
Thank you, Prince Alfred.
