=== Clanne & Fogado ===
--- C ---



[Clanne]
Prince Fogado, I have a question.
[Fogado]
Yeah? Go ahead! Lay it on me.
[Clanne]
What do you eat for breakfast?
[Fogado]
Huh. Somehow that's not what I expected.
[Clanne]
Please? I would really like to know.
[Fogado]
Hm, OK. Usually I eat some tropical fruits.
[Clanne]
I see, I see. Do you eat them fresh, or prepare
them in some way?
[Fogado]
Clanne, why are you interrogating me about my
breakfast choices?
[Clanne]
Oh, uh... Well...I guess there's really no point in
beating around the bush.
[Clanne]
People treat me like a boy, but you? You're the
dictionary definition of a man!
[Fogado]
Aaah, thanks! I think.
[Clanne]
You're not much older than me, so...there must
be something you're doing that I'm not doing.
[Fogado]
Hence the question about what I eat
for breakfast.
[Clanne]
Right! If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to
follow you for a bit─learn more about you.
[Clanne]
By studying you up close and personal, maybe
I'll learn the secret to manliness!
[Fogado]
Sure, why not? Sounds kinda fun!
[Clanne]
Thank you, thank you! I promise you won't even
notice I'm here.

[Clanne]
Thanks for letting me shadow you today!
[Fogado]
It was no trouble at all. Did you gather any, uh,
useful data?
[Clanne]
Tons! I have several pages of notes on the best
ways to prepare and eat various tropical fruits.
[Fogado]
Oh. Uh... OK. Not sure I'd call that useful.
[Fogado]
Can I take a look at this notebook of yours?
[Clanne]
Sure! I hope it's not too hard to read. My
handwriting gets...sloppy when I'm excited.
[Fogado]
Let's see here.
[Fogado]
"Fogado is a man of the people. He's so
approachable, you forget he's actually a prince.
[Fogado]
"He leads the Sentinels with a steady hand...
He likes parties...loves gourmet food...
[Fogado]
"He is good at all sports, except fishing."
Hahaha! Tough but fair!
[Fogado]
Hm, you got me to a T. Guess you don't think
I'm anything special anymore, huh?
[Clanne]
What?! If anything, I'm even more awestruck!
You're a man among men!
[Clanne]
But I didn't learn anything that'll close the gap
between us. Feels like it's only getting wider...
[Fogado]
You really think that?
[Fogado]
OK, here's an idea. Let's you and me get
lunch sometime.
[Clanne]
Lunch, huh?
[Fogado]
Yup. I'm gonna let you in on a secret that busts
this whole thing wide open.
[Clanne]
Really? Prince Fogado's secret to manliness,
finally revealed...
[Clanne]
I'll definitely be there. I can't wait!

[Fogado]
Here's your lunch. Extra pickles, just the way
you like it.
[Clanne]
Wow, this looks delicious!
[Fogado]
Now, for the secret I promised. See, there's this
guy I admire. The kind of person I want to be.
[Fogado]
I'm gonna say what I like about him, and that'll
tell you what you need to know.
[Clanne]
I'm all ears. Please, tell me everything.
[Fogado]
This guy's a really hard worker. He's always
thinking of ways to improve himself.
[Fogado]
And he never, ever gives up. Exactly the kind of
positive attitude that the world needs right now.
[Clanne]
Huh. He sounds like an inspiring person to
be around.
[Fogado]
Yes, inspiring, exactly. He makes me want to
follow in his footsteps─always strive for better.
[Clanne]
Who is this guy? Is it someone I know?
[Fogado]
I think so. He's here, writing something in his
notebook.
[Clanne]
You mean he's somewhere nearby? Or...
[Clanne]
Wait, what?
[Fogado]
I know you look up to me, but the truth is...
I look up you too. Maybe more so.
[Clanne]
WHAT?!
[Fogado]
Listen. This stuff about being a boy, being
a man, all that? None of it matters.
[Fogado]
You're better off if you stop worrying about it
and do your own thing.
[Fogado]
And your positive, hardworking attitude?
That's a pretty great thing...if you ask me.
[Clanne]
I... Wow. That's really nice of you. I don't know
what to say.
[Clanne]
I'd better put in double the effort so I don't
let you down!
[Fogado]
Uh-oh. Then I'll be twice as impressed. I think
at that point my head might explode.
[Clanne]
Hmm... I guess this is what they mean by
bringing out the best in each other, huh?
[Fogado]
I'd say so.
[Fogado]
Come on! Let's have some food. You gotta eat if
you want to be a big, strong Clanne.
[Clanne]
Don't mind if I do!
