=== Anna ===

[Anna]
I wish I'd had more time to run my shop...or at
least seen my family again...

=== Bunet ===

[Bunet]
All of my senses are fading. And still...defeat
tastes so bitter...

=== Boucheron ===



[Boucheron]
Don't cry for me... I think I can finally...find
my way.

=== Alfred (CASUAL) ===

[Alfred]
Guess I didn't train hard enough after all. Sorry,
but I'd better retreat for now.

=== Anna (CASUAL) ===

[Anna]
Why would you do that?! OK, c'mon, Anna.
Don't let 'em see you cry.

=== Bunet (CASUAL) ===

[Bunet]
I must retreat or else I risk becoming food
for worms.

=== Boucheron (CASUAL) ===



[Boucheron]
I've taken too many serious wounds to remain
here. Time for me to withdraw.

=== Céline (CASUAL) ===


[Céline]
The fight for peace must not end here. I hate
to leave you, but I must withdraw.

=== Chloé (CASUAL) ===

[Chloé]
I won't be much use in this state. I'd better
head to the rear lines to rest.

=== Citrinne (CASUAL) ===



[Citrinne]
Just as I thought, I'm not strong enough.
I must retreat, but I will grow stronger.

=== Clanne (CASUAL) ===

[Clanne]
Ugh, I'm retreating. I'm not sure I'm cut out to
be a steward...

=== Diamant (CASUAL) ===

[Diamant]
If I die here, all may be lost. I have to retreat...
I have to keep Brodia safe.

=== Etie (CASUAL) ===



[Etie]
This is so embarrassing. I'm gonna pull out
and get back to my training.

I want to stay by the Divine Dragon's side, but
I can't take anymore. Sorry, I've gotta retreat.

=== Goldmary (CASUAL) ===

[Goldmary]
Can't believe I've been outclassed. Suppose I'd
best retreat for now.

[Hortensia]
Ridiculous... I'll pull back for now, but next time
is gonna be different!

[Ivy]
I'm sorry, Divine One. It would be rash to press
on. I must retreat.

=== Jade (CASUAL) ===


[Jade]
Ugh... I have to withdraw so I can keep our
people safe in future battles.

=== Jean (CASUAL) ===

[Jean]
It's a serious wound, but not a mortal one.
I'd better get some bed rest and heal.

=== Kagetsu (CASUAL) ===

[Kagetsu]
It seems I've blundered. I must retreat for now.
I will redeem myself next time.

=== Lapis (CASUAL) ===

[Lapis]
I'm down, but if I stay alive, I can keep on
fighting. Hate to say it, but I have to retreat...

=== Lindon (CASUAL) ===


[Lindon]
My wife isn't ready for me yet. I'd best retreat
now and fight again another day.

[Louis]
Pardon, but I must bow out. Else I fear my
eyes might close forever.

[Alear]
I must...retreat...

[Mauvier]
I cannot die. Lady Veyle still needs me.
Apologies, Divine One. I must withdraw.

[Merrin]
That was not my coolest move. Nothing more
I can do but retreat.

[Timerra]
Haha─ O-ow... Guess I can't fight anymore.
Sorry, I've gotta retreat.

=== Pandreo (CASUAL) ===


[Pandreo]
Whew, it was nearly the end for me. I better
retreat while I can still move.

=== Panette (CASUAL) ===


[Panette]
I can't believe I lost. I'll back off for now, but
I won't forget this.

=== Rosado (CASUAL) ===


[Rosado]
What a mess. No more I can do here─the rest is
up to you.

=== Saphir (CASUAL) ===



[Saphir]
Can't believe I slipped up this bad. I'm gonna
fall back while I still can.

=== Seadall (CASUAL) ===


[Seadall]
Am I fated to join the stars? Not today. I will
exit the stage with what grace I still have.

=== Alcryst (CASUAL) ===



[Alcryst]
I knew I would disappoint everyone. I should
just get out of the way for now... I'm sorry...

=== Amber (CASUAL) ===


[Amber]
A fallen hero... That would make a good legend,
but it's not the one I want. I'd better retreat!

=== Vander (CASUAL) ===



[Vander]
I am but a hindrance to the Divine Dragon in
this shape. For now, I must fall back.

I'm falling back. The pain doesn't matter, but
I've got to rest so I can fight to the end.

[Yunaka]
I'd better pull back. Sorry! I'm outta here!

are safe, then I... I'm...

=== Clanne ===

[Clanne]
I almost had a chance to be useful and now
I can't be by your side anymore... Goodbye...

=== Alfred (EXIST) ===

[Alfred]
I can't die here... Firene needs me. Sorry, but I
don't think I can be on the front lines anymore.

=== Céline (EXIST) ===


[Céline]
I've fought my last here... But if I withdraw now,
I can still fight elsewhere in my own way.

[Diamant]
I must...withdraw. I can't let myself die... Brodia
still needs me, even if I'm unable to fight...

you, but my fighting days are over...

[Veyle]
The pain, the wounds...I don't care about that.
I just can't die. I can fight no more...

=== Etie ===



[Etie]
All those workouts...for nothing. At least you
could use my body for a shield...

=== Fogado ===



[Fogado]
I...I can't see anything. Hahaha... Thanks for the
good times. I loved you all...

=== Framme ===

[Framme]
Divine One...where are you? I want to say one
last goodbye...

=== Goldmary ===

[Goldmary]
Such a short life I had... I can only hope the next
one's...every bit as lovely...

=== Hortensia ===

[Hortensia]
Ugh...not yet. Please... Not before I can see
Elusia the way it used to be...

=== Jade ===


[Jade]
A fallen knight who couldn't protect anyone.
I suppose it's funny... Like a tragic comedy...

[Jean]
This is one wound...I can't treat. I'm sorry,
everyone I'll never save now...

here, !

[Ike]
If we lose you, then we've lost this battle!
On your feet, !

=== Alear & Corrin ===

[Corrin]
Please, no. You're supposed to walk this path
with us to the end, !

=== Alear & Leif ===

[Leif]
Open your eyes, !

[Rosado]
What good is being cute...if I can't even protect
my friends...

This fortune cannot be denied. I only hope I...
danced with beauty to the very...end...
