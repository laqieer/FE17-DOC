[Anna] 
Hey, you're Lapis, right? I've been looking all 
over for you!
[Anna] 
I hear you're a whiz at making neat stuff out 
of whatever's lying around.
[Lapis] 
Um, yes. That's me.
[Anna] 
Yes! I smell profit to be made.
[Anna] 
The name's Lady Anna. I'm a merchant who's 
just as good at cutting wood as cutting costs!
[Lapis] 
Oh. Uh, all right. It's a pleasure to meet 
you, Anna.
[Anna] 
Aw, you don't have to be so formal! Lady Anna 
is fine.
[Anna] 
Bottom line, Lapis, we should be in 
business together.
[Lapis] 
Heh. I'm...not sure I follow.
[Anna] 
There's nothing to it! You'll be in charge of 
supplying cute goods, and I'll drum up demand.
[Anna] 
Boom! We make a killing. I'm happy, you're 
happy, the customer's happy. Win-win-win.
[Anna] 
As labor, you'll get your share, of course. Come 
on, pleeease? Don't make a little girl cry.
[Lapis] 
Let's slow down a bit here. What sort of things 
would you want me to make?
[Anna] 
Well, I'm from Wintertide Village, so something 
related to that would be nice!
[Lapis] 
I see. So you'd want something that reminds 
people of your hometown.
[Anna] 
You're the ideas department. Once you have a 
product, I'll work my sales and marketing magic.
[Lapis] 
Uh, sure... OK.
[Anna] 
What, you don't believe me? You think I can't 
close a sale just 'cause I'm a little kid?
[Anna] 
I'll give you a guarantee─if I can't sell whatever 
you make, I'll give you one billion gold!
[Anna] 
It's a can't-lose proposition!
[Lapis] 
All right. I'll try to think of something to make...

[Lapis] 
Lady Anna? I've made an item that perfectly 
captures the spirit of your village.
[Anna] 
What, for real?! That was quick!
[Lapis] 
Yes. I took some bits and bobs I found lying 
around and made them into a snowman doll.
[Anna] 
Wow! It's so cute!
[Lapis] 
That's not all. See that bell the snowman is 
holding? Give it a twist.
[Anna] 
Like this?
[Anna] 
Hey! It even plays music! How'd you get it to 
do that?!
[Lapis] 
Someone threw out a music box, so I 
incorporated it into the design.
[Lapis] 
Oh, and if you look at the doll from different 
angles, it sparkles.
[Lapis] 
I stuck shiny little pebbles onto it.
[Anna] 
That's genius! Oh, I knew I had an eye 
for talent!
[Anna] 
And since you just used cast-off materials, 
our production costs are practically nothing!
[Anna] 
This is the BEST! It combines my two favorite 
things─cute and free!
[Lapis] 
I'm glad you like it! Thanks for giving me a 
chance to flex my creative muscles.
[Anna] 
Trust me, I'm the one who should be thanking 
you here.
[Anna] 
Just wait until you get your share of the profits. 
We're gonna make a killing!

[Lapis] 
Lady Anna, did you find a buyer for that 
snowman doll?
[Anna] 
Oh, right... The thing about that is...
[Lapis] 
What's...what's wrong? Are you crying?
[Anna] 
...
[Lapis] 
You weren't able to sell it, huh?
[Anna] 
Nope. I'm real, real sorry.
[Anna] 
I was carrying it around, trying to find a buyer, 
when I dropped it. There's...not much left.
[Lapis] 
Oh, I see.
[Anna] 
Pathetic, huh? Here I was, talking myself up...
[Anna] 
I'll give you the billion gold I promised to make 
up for it. I hope you can forgive me...
[Lapis] 
That's all right, Lady Anna. I don't need money.
[Anna] 
You don't...need money? What?
[Lapis] 
Nope. I don't want compensation. I just want 
another chance to make something for you.
[Anna] 
What do you mean?
[Lapis] 
I had a good time crafting that doll! I'd hate for 
it to be the only time we work together.
[Lapis] 
Plus...I've been hearing about Wintertide Village 
since I was a little girl.
[Lapis] 
A secluded village in Elusia with festivals 
year-round. I always dreamed of going there.
[Anna] 
Word traveled that far, huh?
[Lapis] 
Yes! To be honest, I thought it was the stuff of 
bedtime stories. But it's real! Who knew!
[Lapis] 
I felt so blessed to be making something that 
celebrates such a wondrous place...
[Lapis] 
So what do you say? Let's give it one more try. 
Or however many tries it takes to get it right!
[Anna] 
I like that attitude.
[Anna] 
Let's give ourselves a do-over! This time, we'll 
do it right.
[Lapis] 
What do you mean?
[Anna] 
I mean we should budget for some real 
materials instead of cast-off junk.
[Lapis] 
Um... That's a bit intimidating. I don't usually 
use proper materials.
[Anna] 
How much harder could it be?
[Lapis] 
Well, I'll just have to do my best to make 
something that flies off the shelves!
[Anna] 
Attagirl!
[Anna] 
Once we get our operation going again, boom! 
We'll make a killing and retire young!
