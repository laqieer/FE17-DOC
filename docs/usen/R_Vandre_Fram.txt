=== Vander & Framme ===

[Vander]
FRAMME!
[Framme]
Ahh!
[Vander]
Why are you loafing about? I told you to sort
through the offerings.
[Framme]
Oops! I completely forgot.
[Vander]
Grant me the patience... How do you manage
to bungle even the smallest task?
[Vander]
This is exactly why I fear for your future.
[Framme]
I meant to do it, honest. It just kinda...slipped
my mind.
[Vander]
You know I will not credit that excuse.
Forgetting is the same as doing nothing at all.
[Vander]
Imagine how disappointed your parents would
be if they found out.
[Framme]
Aw...
[Vander]
Framme, I have high expectations for you and
your brother. You are my successors, after all.
[Vander]
For my peace of mind, and to honor the mother
and father who left you in my care...do better.
[Framme]
Yes, sir!
[Framme]
This is the last time I let you down,
Vander. Promise!
[Vander]
Very good.

[Framme]
Uh... Oh no. Oh no!
[Framme]
I forgot where I'm supposed to take
this package.
[Framme]
Ugh... Vander's gonna kill me.
[Vander]
Hello, Framme.
[Framme]
AH!
[Framme]
Vander, hey! So I was on my way to deliver that
package like you asked, and, um...
[Framme]
I messed up. Again. You can go ahead and yell
at me now.
[Vander]
Grant me the patience... No matter. It wasn't
terribly urgent.
[Framme]
You're...you're not mad?
[Vander]
Why should I be? You admitted your error
and apologized.
[Framme]
But I promised to stop messing things up.
[Vander]
Growth takes time. The Somniel wasn't built
in a day.
[Framme]
That's true...
[Vander]
Try breaking tasks into pieces and going
through them step by step. That works for me.
[Framme]
OK! Next time, I'll get it right for sure. You're
gonna be so proud!

[Vander]
All right, Framme. What is it this time?
[Vander]
I presume there has been some trouble with the
task I assigned you.
[Framme]
Wrong! Hehe, I'll take care of that in a sec.
[Vander]
Well, then?
[Framme]
Here. This is for you.
[Framme]
It's my way of thanking you for, y'know,
expecting the best of me.
[Vander]
What is this? A pack of..."Frickets"?
[Framme]
Yup! Short for Framme Tickets. Think of 'em as
a big sorry for all the grief I've caused you.
[Framme]
If you're ever feeling tired, or there's a chore
you don't wanna do, or whatever...use a Fricket!
[Framme]
Day or night, no matter what it is, I'll zip right
over and help you out.
[Vander]
Framme...
[Vander]
While I have no children of my own...
[Vander]
I imagine this is how it feels to be a
proud parent.
[Vander]
Thank you. I will be sure to use these Frickets
sparingly. They are quite precious, after all.
[Framme]
Hehe, you got that right! As for me, I'll keep
trying my best to make you proud.
[Framme]
I'm gonna make mistakes sometimes, but with
your help, I know I can get better.
[Framme]
So keep teaching me to be the very best
steward I can be!
[Vander]
Of course. Though you appear to be well on
your way already.
