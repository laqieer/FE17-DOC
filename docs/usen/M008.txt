=== Chapter 8 The Kingdom of Might ===

(Brodia Castle)
After rebuffing an Elusian attack, 
the Divine Dragon's army reaches 
their destination: Brodia Castle.

[Alcryst] 
We're here. Brodia Castle.
I don't see any Elusian soldiers. Thank 
goodness... The attack hasn't begun.
[Alear] 
Wait. There's someone in front of the gate. 
He doesn't look like a guard.
[Alcryst] 
Is it an enemy soldier?
No, that's...
That's Diamant! He must have come out to 
greet us!

[Diamant] 1 
[Alear] 2 
[Diamant] 
I've heard so much about you. I'm honored to 
finally meet the legend in person.
[Alear] 
It's a pleasure, Prince Diamant.
[Diamant] 
And Prince Alfred, welcome. Queen Ève's letter 
explained your situation.
Thanks for coming all this way. It's good to 
see you.
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
Likewise. I'm sorry it took a war for us to meet 
again after all this time.
[Diamant] 
Oh, and Alcryst, thanks for escorting our guests 
from the border. I know that's a rugged road.
[Alcryst] 3 

[Alcryst] 
It was nothing, really.
I bear ill news, however. Elusian forces attacked 
us at the Grand Crossing.
[Diamant] 
Is that right?
[Alcryst] 
A battalion led by Princess Hortensia. We 
fought her off, but she said something troubling.
The crown princess intends to assault 
Brodia Castle.
If they're after our Emblem Ring, we may be 
on course for a dangerous confrontation.
[Diamant] 
We'll have to prepare our defenses. Thanks for 
the warning, Alcryst.
Come. Father will want to hear about this.

[Morion] 1 
[Diamant] 3 

[Morion] 
Why do you all look so tense?

[Diamant] 
Father? You were supposed to be 
waiting inside.
[Morion] 
Yes, I know. And I was. But then I had this 
feeling my boy Alcryst might be home.
It seems my fatherly intuition was right, 
as usual, heh! Welcome back, son.
[Alcryst] 4 

[Alcryst] 
Thank you, Father.
[Diamant] 
I wish you'd stop finding excuses to leave the 
castle. It's not safe out here.
[Morion] 
Please, Diamant, not another lecture.
Where's the harm in welcoming my dear boy 
back from his journey?
Anyway. We'd best not argue in front of 
our guests.
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Oh! It's all right...
[Morion] 
Please pardon my rudeness. Divine One, 
Prince Alfred, welcome.
I am Morion, king of Brodia!
[Alear] 
Good to meet you.
[Morion] 
Likewise! I never imagined I'd meet the 
Divine Dragon .
Indeed, such a special occasion calls for a 
welcoming duel!
[Diamant] 
There's no time for that. We have an important 
matter to discuss.
As Alcryst was escorting our guests from the 
border, Elusian soldiers attacked them.
[Morion] 
Ugh... Elusians.
[Diamant] 
It appears that the crown princess is planning 
an assault on Brodia Castle.
[Morion] 
Already making their move, huh? Soldiers! 
Go, now! Shore up our defenses!
[Diamant] 
$ ブロディア兵士 ソードナイト1 3 
ブロディア兵士 ソードナイト1 
Yes, Your Majesty!
ブロディア兵士 ソードナイト1 

[Morion] 
Well done getting that information, Alcryst.
[Alcryst] 
Please... I don't deserve such kind words.
[Morion] 
Humble as ever, son. Haha...
[Alear] 
King Morion, excuse me, but I need your 
kingdom's aid.
[Morion] 
You want our Emblem Ring, right?
[Alear] 
...
[Morion] 
I knew you'd ask! That's why I brought it. 
Here─the Ring of the Young Lion!
Hey, Diamant─think fast!
[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
Father. We're supposed to take care of the ring, 
not throw it around.
[Morion] 
Ah, you're no fun.
[Alear] 
Um... Alfred.
[Alcryst] 
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
Yes?
[Alear] 
King Morion seems so...nice.
This is the man who's always invading Elusia? 
I thought he'd be more intimidating.
[Alfred] 
You're seeing Morion─friend and family man. 
He's known to be a bighearted guy.
But in battle, the demon comes out. He's not 
someone you want as your enemy.
[Diamant] 
Ugh... Father can be such a handful sometimes. 
Divine One, I've got the ring for you.
[Alear] 
Thank you.
[Morion] 
What will you do with it?
[Alear] 
I'm going to summon an Emblem.
Rise up, Emblem of Binding!

[Morion] 1 
[Diamant] 3 
[Alear] 2 

[Roy] 4 
[Roy] 
I'm Roy. If you're summoning me...that can only 
mean war has begun.
[Diamant] 
There was a person in there?
[Morion] 
How about that! All along, this Emblem dwelt 
in our family's ring.
And now you have released him. It seems 
"Divine" is no exaggeration, huh?
[Roy] 
&amp; ブロディア兵士 ランスアーマー1 4 
" ブロディア兵士 ランスアーマー1 
Urgent news, Your Majesty! An Elusian wyvern 
rider is approaching!
It's dodging all our archers' attacks.
[Alear] 
What?!
[Diamant] 
She's here.
Divine One. May I call upon Roy's help to 
defend the castle?
[Alear] 
Of course.

[Ivy] 1 
[Morion] 2 

[Alcryst] 3 
[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
I underestimated how far you could get into 
Brodian territory, Princess Ivy.
[Ivy] 
My soldiers are on the way. Now, I will give you 
a chance to surrender before they arrive.
[Morion] 
Oh, I'm itching for that fight.
[Diamant] 
Father, go back to the castle.
[Morion] 
What? Why?
[Diamant] 
If something happened to you, our country 
would be devastated. Please, leave this to us.
[Morion] 
Right, why should the king get a say in the 
matter? I'll do as you ask.
But, Diamant, Alcryst...don't you dare get killed.
[Diamant] 
We won't.
[Alcryst] 
Well, we'll try not to.
[Morion] 

[Ivy] 
You must be the Divine Dragon .
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
That's right.
[Ivy] 
You really are as stunning as my sister said. 
I'm pleased to meet you.
As is my ring.
[Alear] 
But that's─
[Ivy] 
The Ring of the Sage Lord. A gift from 
my father.
With its power, I am sorry to say, I must kill you.
[Diamant] 
I won't let that happen. It's you who will fall, 
Princess Ivy.
[Ivy] 
You won't surrender, then? In that case, my 
forces will prepare for battle.
[Diamant] 
As will ours.
[Alear] 
I'll stop at nothing to get those rings back.

sword with these arms again.
I will do what I can to retrieve that which has 
been stolen.

How could I have failed?
[Diamant] 
It's over, Princess Ivy. Surrender.
[Ivy] 
I will not. There is more for me to do.
[Ivy] 
[Diamant] 
No! Agh...
[Alear] 
She's gone.

Your Highness! Urgent news from the border!
[Diamant] 
What is it?
" ブロディア兵士 ランスアーマー1 
An Elusian battalion stands at the ready!
King Hyacinth is acting as general─he's leading 
their army himself!
[Diamant] 
What?
" ブロディア兵士 ランスアーマー1 
Yes...and he is demanding to see King Morion.
[Diamant] 
...
[Morion] 3 

[Morion] 
I must face him. Anything less would bring 
dishonor to Brodia.
[Diamant] 
Father, he's baiting you. This may be a trap of 
some kind. Go back inside.
[Morion] 
Hah! I can fight my way out of whatever trap 
he springs.
[Diamant] 
I urge you to reconsider.
[Morion] 
Listen, who's the father and who's the son 
here? Stop trying to protect me.
[Diamant] 
...
[Morion] 
Son, this has been happening a lot lately. 
What's it all about?
Are you worried Brodia might lose this war? 
Or lose...its king?
[Diamant] 
...
We're not ready for any of this. Brodia, to lose 
its king. Or me, my father.
[Alcryst] 
Diamant?
[Diamant] 
From a young age, I was told I would lead 
Brodia after you died.
Imagine...a boy forced to anticipate his father's 
death. To think of that empty throne.
The Fell Dragon has returned. War is here. 
The future is uncertain.
And I'm not ready.
[Morion] 
It's all right, Diamant. If I die, I die. Brodia will 
live on.
[Diamant] 
But, Father!
[Morion] 
What, you don't believe me? After I'm gone, 
I know you will lead with a steady hand.
Though I'm offended you expect that day to 
come so soon.
You think I'm going to lose, huh? You think I'm 
weak? That I need your protection?
Oh, the hubris of youth.
[Diamant] 
That's not what I meant.
[Morion] 
King Hyacinth awaits me on the field of war, his 
army at the ready. If Brodia hides, then what?
After years locked in battle with Elusia, will we 
reveal ourselves as cowards?
Listen to me, Diamant. I will fight bravely for 
Brodia. I do not fear death.
Being known as a king who runs from battle... 
That scares me far more.
[Diamant] 
...
[Morion] 
What do you think about all this, Alcryst?
[Alcryst] 
Me?!
[Morion] 
If I die, and Diamant alongside me, you will take 
the throne.
[Alcryst] 
...
[Diamant] 
Father, don't say that.
[Alcryst] 
I...
I will not let that pass. I will protect Diamant to 
the bitter end.
[Diamant] 
Alcryst...
[Morion] 
Haha! That's my boy! Diamant, you could learn 
a thing or two from your brother.
Fear has no place in my kingdom.
If we step into fear, then we step out of Brodia.
[Diamant] 
...
[Morion] 
Now then, to the border!
[Diamant] 
It seems I can't dissuade you from this path. 
All I can do is walk it with you.
Come on, everyone. Let's show Elusia why 
we're called the kingdom of might.
[Morion] 
Haha! That's it! This won't be the last time 
I see the castle.
And when I'm back, a tournament with our 
strongest warriors! That means you, Divine One!
[Alear] 
Me?
[Morion] 
Yes! I want to see you transform into a mighty 
dragon. Whoosh! Roar!
[Alear] 
Oh... OK.
[Morion] 
What's the matter?
[Alear] 
Ah, nothing. You're right. I could turn into 
a dragon.
[Morion] 
Haha! I'm looking forward to that!
[Diamant] 
I'd like to spar with you, too, Divine One. After 
Father gets his chance.
But that's for later. Now we should prepare 
for our journey to the border.
[Morion] 
Indeed.
[Morion] 
[Diamant] 

[Alcryst] 

[Alear] 
...
This talk of turning into a dragon... Mother 
could. Can I?
I have no idea if I can. Or how.
