=== Chapter 14 The Battle for Solm ===

(Solm Palace)
Receiving word of Hortensia's
attack, the Divine Dragon's army
hastens back to Solm Palace.

--- OP ---






[Alear]
Queen Seforia!
[Hortensia]
Finally! Took you long enough.
[Timerra]
Let her go.
[Hortensia]
Yeah, I don't think so. And don't you dare come
any closer.
I've got an Emblem Ring. It'd be so easy to
kill her.
[Timerra]
...
[Seforia]
Sorry, everyone. I didn't realize she was still on
Elusia's side.
[Alear]
I don't see any other soldiers. Did you get in
by yourself?
[Hortensia]
Uh-huh. I told the guards I'd been separated
from Ivy, and they let me walk right in.
Now, you've got a choice: hand over the rings
or I kill the queen.
[Timerra]

[Ivy]
Hortensia, don't do this.
[Hortensia]
Ivy! It's been a while... You know, I... I thought
you were dead.
I was so relieved when I heard you'd made it.
But...now what? You're with them?
[Ivy]
Well, I...
[Hortensia]
Since Father sacrificed himself, Elusia has been
working in concert with Lord Sombron.
But you? You abandoned us─abandoned me─
and took sides with the enemy.
You're a traitor, Ivy! A stinking traitor!
[Ivy]
I have not betrayed anyone. Hortensia, please,
hear me out.
[Hortensia]
I don't wanna hear another word out of your
dirty, double-crossing mouth! Just give me
the rings.
[Alear]
...
No, Hortensia. Never.
[Hortensia]
I'm sorry, did I not make myself clear? Hand
them over or I kill the queen.
[Alear]
I heard you. But I'm not doing what you ask.
I'd be throwing away everything she, Timerra,
Fogado, and the people of Solm have done.
So no, I won't give you the rings. And I won't
let you kill Queen Seforia.
[Hortensia]
Ugh!
[Ivy]



[Timerra]
I agree with the Divine Dragon. Those rings are
staying with us.

[Alear]
Right.
[Timerra]
If we let the Fell Dragon have them, my country
and my people are doomed.
So threaten us all you want. Take my whole
family hostage, if it makes you happy.
But I stand for Solm, and I always will.
[Seforia]
There she is, the future queen of Solm.
And her ally, the Divine Dragon.
[Hortensia]
What's wrong with you?! This is your mother!
You're supposed to be scared!
Cry already! Cower and beg for her life! Give me
what I want!
No, what I need. I need the rings. It's the only
way to bring Father back.
[Alear]

[Ivy]
Hortensia... He's gone. The Fell Dragon
murdered him. You watched it happen.
There's no way we can bring him back, even
with the rings.
[Hortensia]
You don't know that! I have to try! I have to
save Father and Elusia!
Everything's all wrong now. I just want to put it
back how it was before!
[Ivy]
I know how you feel.
[Hortensia]
No! Stop trying to get in my head, all right?
I'll kill her! I'll do it!
[Timerra]


[Alear]
I don't think you can.
Not if you know the pain of losing a parent.
[Hortensia]
...
[Seforia]
Well? Get on with it, then, if that's what you
truly want. Are we doing this or aren't we?
[Hortensia]
I... I...
Whaaa!
[Alear]
She needs her sister now.
[Ivy]
It's all right, Hortensia. Oh, I've been so worried
about you.
[Hortensia]
Ivy...



[Zephia]
I'm afraid I have to cut the reunion short.
[Alear]
Zephia. What are you doing here?
[Zephia]
Missed you, too, Divine One. I must thank you
for helping us gather so many rings.
All of them, I thought. Until the princess's─
rather former princess's─thievery came to light.
[Ivy]
...
[Zephia]
Enough about that. More importantly...
Princess Hortensia...
[Hortensia]
...
[Zephia]
Taking a ring without permission? Sneaking off
to a place like this? Naughty, naughty.
Lord Sombron and Lady Veyle's orders were
clear─to wait, to watch.
Oh, your retainers, by the way? They tried to
stop us. They failed.
[Hortensia]
Where are they? What did you do to Goldmary
and Rosado?
[Zephia]
You'll have to see for yourself. Now, we hadn't
planned on making a move this early.
But since we're here, it would be a shame to
return home without a few souvenirs.
Marni? Mauvier? Wouldn't you agree?



[Alear]
More Hounds.

[Mauvier]
I did not expect it would be so easy to enter
the impregnable Solm Palace.
[Marni]
Zephia, what do we do with the queen? Kill her?
She's not much use anymore.
[Mauvier]

[Zephia]
No. Lord Sombron will want to savor every last
drop of sovereign blood.
[Marni]
Ah! Haha, I gotcha.




[Alear]
Queen Seforia!
[Zephia]
What a good girl you are, Princess Hortensia,
coming here to get rings for Lord Sombron.
Now that the three of us are here, why don't we
help finish what you started.
We can kill them all and head back home to
Elusia. What do you say?
[Hortensia]
But... But I...
[Zephia]
Come, dear. Take command.
Just think. If we take their rings, we'll be so
close to having all 12.
[Hortensia]
So close... Just a few more rings...
[Alear]
Hortensia? What's going on?
[Hortensia]
With all the rings, then Father will...
[Zephia]
That's right. King Hyacinth will be resurrected.
We'll make everything just as it was before.
[Hortensia]
Just as it was...before...
[Hortensia]
[Hortensia]
...
I will kill them all. I will take their rings. It's the
only way to save Father.
[Alear]
Is she really going to fight us?
[Ivy]
Hortensia, snap out of it, please! Hortensia!
[Zephia]
She can't hear you, unfortunately. Enjoy killing
one another, won't you?


--- ED ---

[Hortensia]
Ivy, what...happened?
[Ivy]
Oh, you've come back to me! Thank goodness.
[Hortensia]
Where'd all the Elusian soldiers go?


[Alear]
They retreated.
[Hortensia]
I should go with them...
[Alear]
No. It's not safe. Zephia could take control over
you again.
[Hortensia]
But I was the last person left at Elusia Castle.
Without me, there'll be no one to lead.
No one to take care of the country Father
left behind...
[Ivy]
That is true... But it's out of our hands.
[Hortensia]
How can you say that? Don't you care about
Elusia at all?
[Ivy]
Of course I do. I would have given my life to
protect our kingdom.
But it is not our kingdom anymore. It's the
Fell Dragon's. Surely you see that.
[Hortensia]
...
[Alear]
Princess Ivy...
[Ivy]
I didn't want to admit it, but Father stopped
being king as soon as the Fell Dragon awoke.
Since then true power has rested with Sombron,
his daughter, and the Four Hounds.
If you went back now, you would become an
instrument of their designs─just as Father was.
[Hortensia]
I...
[Ivy]
I want to go home too. You have no idea
how badly.
But there's no home to go back to until we
defeat the Fell Dragon.
After allowing Father to relinquish his power to
Sombron, we owe our people no less.
[Hortensia]
...
The castle. My only home since I was little...
We really can't go back now, can we?
[Ivy]
No... We can't.
[Hortensia]
That little nook where I had tea with my friends.
The garden where you and I read together...
Even Rosado and Goldmary. I've left everything
and everyone behind.
All right, Ivy. I'll join this fight. So that someday,
things can be like they were again.
[Ivy]
Thank you, Hortensia.
[Hortensia]
I'm really sorry for...for what I did. Divine One?
You should have this.
[Alear]
The Ring of the Instructor. One of the rings
stolen from Lythos. Thank you for returning it.
[Hortensia]
Don't give me too much credit. I wasn't exactly
planning to hand it over.
[Alear]
Even so, you have my thanks.
Teach us, Emblem of the Academy!



[Byleth]
I am Emblem Byleth. It feels as though I've just
awoken from a very long dream...
I'm glad to be where I belong─at your side. Use
my power to guide everyone.
[Alear]
I will. Thank you, Emblem Byleth.




[Seforia]
So, how is everyone?
[Alear]
Queen Seforia, you're all right!
[Seforia]
That I am. Some Elusian soldiers tried to seize
me, but I was saved at just the right moment.

[Timerra]
We took 'em down.
[Diamant]
Alfred and I intended to help.
[Diamant]
[Alfred]
But by the time we'd drawn our weapons, the
fight was already over.
[Timerra]
Haha! That's the Solm royal guard for ya.
Pretty good, right?
[Alear]
I'm just glad the queen is safe. Well
done, everyone.
[Seforia]
Well done yourself. No more trespassers. My
palace is rid of them.
Divine One, thank you for protecting the rings
and my family with such courage.
The way you spoke, the look in your eyes...
You were the spitting image of Queen Lumera.
[Alear]
...
Your words mean so much... Thank you.
[Timerra]
[Alfred]

[Alear]

[Hortensia]
Um, excuse me, Queen Seforia?
[Seforia]
You. I assumed you'd gone back to Elusia.
[Hortensia]
Look, I'm really sorry about what I did. I'll
accept whatever punishment you give me.

[Ivy]
I owe you an apology as well.
[Seforia]
...

[Alear]
Queen Seforia, please. Zephia was using some
sort of magic to control Princess Hortensia.
As soon as it wore off, she stopped fighting─
even gave me her Emblem Ring.
[Seforia]
I don't recall Zephia being there when the
young princess held me hostage.
Look me in the eyes, you two.
[Hortensia]
OK...
[Seforia]
Threatening a queen's life is a grave crime. You
deserve a room in the dungeons.
But...I won't send you there.
[Hortensia]
You...won't?
[Seforia]
It was the Fell Dragon's minions who broke in
and started the conflict, right?
Your only crimes were slipping in uninvited...
and threatening to kill me.
If you want to make amends, defeat the
Fell Dragon. Rebuild your kingdom.
When cooler heads return to Elusia, Solm can
only benefit. Let's move on now, shall we?
[Hortensia]
Thank you, Queen Seforia.
[Ivy]
Your show of compassion will not be forgotten.
We will restore Elusia. I swear it.
[Seforia]
For my part, I think I'd better look into shoring
up the palace's defenses.
[Alear]
You're right. The Fell Dragon's forces might
come back for you...
I can leave some soldiers here to help keep
you safe.
[Seforia]
Oh, no need, no need. I have lots of family
members who can handle things here.
If the situation really boils over, I can always
leave a double here and wander the land.
So don't worry about me. You just focus on
taking out the Fell Dragon.
[Alear]
We will. Thank you.
[Seforia]
Timerra, it's time you showed the Divine
Dragon where to find Solm's other ring.
[Hortensia]


[Timerra]
Sure thing, Mom. One Ring of the Crux of Fate,
coming right up!
[Alear]
Where is it?
[Timerra]
The Northern Fortress. Oh... You don't scare
easily, do you?

[Veyle] 白 悪 2
[Veyle] 白 悪
Hm...
Another ring in the Divine Dragon's hands.
Still, not enough to turn the tide.
Urgh...
I must sleep. Curse this feeble form of mine for
plunging me into darkness.
I pray that next time, my waking hours will not
end so soon.
...
[Veyle] 白 悪


[Veyle]
...
Sand? But...what happened to all the snow?
Where am I?
Why does this keep happening to me?


--- EV ---

" [Hortensia]
I will defeat you. It's the only way to...
Ugh... Ahh!

[Alear]
The Emblem is surging with Fell Dragon energy!
Be on your guard.


--- MOVIE ---


--- BT ---

[Mauvier]
My orders do not involve dying. I take my leave.

 [Hortensia]
I must get the rings. I must save Father.


[Ivy]
Hortensia, please! Come to your senses!
" [Hortensia]
Why fight me, Ivy? All I want is to bring Father
back. Don't you miss him?

[Ivy]
Of course. So much, I fear my heart will never
mend. That's why I cannot lose you too.

" [Hortensia]
Why does nothing go my way?

[Zephia]
Relax
[Zephia]
The stolen rings. You'll return them, won't you?

[Zephia]
Well, if it isn't my favorite lizard! How's Solm
treating you?
Don't you worry, your friends are safe with me.
Sigurd, Celica, Micaiah... Marth.

[Alear]
You...
[Zephia]
Oh, did you want to see them? Shame. I didn't
bring them with me.
Couldn't have you taking them, could I?

[Zephia]
That would have been too easy, I suppose...
We'll meet again soon enough.

[Marni]
Solm Palace is so pretty! It's a nicer tomb than
you deserve!

[Marni]
The floor's slippery! That's the only reason
I lost! I'm going home!

[Mauvier]
Your army is not to be trifled with. Because
I respect you, I will hold nothing back.
