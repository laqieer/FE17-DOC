[Fogado]
Hey, Rosado! You're looking cute, as always.
[Rosado]
Thanks so much, Prince Fogado!
[Rosado]
I'm getting cuter by the day─at this rate,
I'm pretty sure I'll be gorgeous forever!
[Fogado]
Haha, no doubt about it. I'd bet your cuteness
stretches on in perpetuity.
[Rosado]
Hmm... You really think so? I dunno, you're not
exactly selling it.
[Rosado]
I don't feel a ton of heart behind those words.
They seem a little empty.
[Fogado]
How hurtful. I'll have you know, I am nothing if
not sincere.
[Rosado]
Yeah? Prove it. Tell me how adorable I am.
Say it like you mean it and I'll believe you!
[Fogado]
All right. You are... How to put it? As lovely as
a delicate blossom in a Solmic Oasis.
[Rosado]
That's a little better. So, am I the cutest you've
ever seen?
[Fogado]
Hm? Oh, no. Definitely not.
[Rosado]
What?
[Rosado]
I'm sorry, WHAT?!
[Fogado]
You know... I just remembered something I have
to do. Prince business. See you around!
[Fogado]

[Rosado]
Hey, wait a second! What do you mean,
"definitely not"?!
[Rosado]
How am I not the cutest?! Prince Fogado,
come back!

[Rosado]
Hi, Prince Fogado!
[Fogado]
Hey, Rosado! The sun stays shining, and you
stay cute.
[Rosado]
That's right! I'm always cute, aren't I? I'm even
cuter than last time you saw me, aren't I?
[Fogado]
Agreed, and your confidence really heightens it.
[Rosado]
You really mean it this time, right? You're really,
really, reeeeally telling the truth?
[Fogado]
I swear up and down, I'm telling the truth.
[Rosado]
Then...you'd say I'm the absolute cutest ever?
[Fogado]
Well... Not the absolute cutest ever.
[Rosado]
Aww...
[Rosado]
So cruel! I was sure I misheard you last time!
[Rosado]
Why do you keep saying that?! Are you lifting
me up on purpose just to knock me down?!
[Fogado]
Heh, calm down, calm down.
[Rosado]
How am I supposed to calm down?!
[Rosado]
The prince with the sharpest eye doesn't even
think I'm all that cute!
[Fogado]
It's not that, Rosado. I'm just not a big believer
in comparisons.
[Rosado]
What do you mean?
[Fogado]
This, that, or the other? It's just not my style.
[Fogado]
You're cute. No need to make it into some big,
overblown contest.
[Fogado]
Know what I mean?
[Rosado]
I...
[Rosado]
I guess I get it, but...
[Rosado]
I dunno. I guess I'll think about it.

[Rosado]
Just one more final touch and...there!
A perfect landscape.


[Fogado]
Rosado! Drawing again, I see. What beautiful
scenery.
[Rosado]
Oh... Hey, Prince Fogado.
[Fogado]
And your face is every bit as beautiful.
[Rosado]
Really? You think? Aw, thanks so much!
[Rosado]
Wait, no! I'm not falling for that again. I know
how this goes.
[Rosado]
The second I ask you if I'm the very cutest,
you'll turn on me again!
[Fogado]
Sorry. I told you, I don't do comparisons.
[Fogado]
Is it wrong of me to love all beauty equally?
[Rosado]
...
[Rosado]
I guess you're right. You've been nothing but
nice to me, and I've been...kinda arrogant.
[Rosado]
It was wrong of me to obsess over being cuter
than everyone else. I'm sorry.
フォガートNah, it's all right. There's no shame in aspiring
to be the best.
[Fogado]
I have one way of thinking about the world,
and you have another.
[Fogado]
We're allowed to disagree, aren't we? And to
respect our differences?
[Rosado]
Respect our differences...
[Rosado]
Yeah, of course.
[Rosado]
I guess instead of digging for more, I should
learn to take your compliments at face value.
[Fogado]
Exactly! You keep being adorable, and I'll keep
complimenting you. Then we're both happy.
[Rosado]
Yeah. I'm adorable, and that's a fact. All's right
with the world.
[Fogado]
Hahaha, there you go! And may I say, I love
seeing that beautiful smile of yours.
[Rosado]
Hahaha! Go on, tell me more!
