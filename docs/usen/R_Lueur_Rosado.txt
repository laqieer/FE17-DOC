[Alear] 
Hello, Rosado.
[Rosado] 
Divine One! Have you seen my latest drawing?
[Alear] 
I have. An old well, deep in a forest... A single 
sunbeam illuminating a lone flower in bloom...
[Alear] 
You conveyed a perfect balance of warmth and 
isolation, light and dark. Just breathtaking.
[Rosado] 
Exactly! You saw all that right away, 
didn't you?
[Rosado] 
You would not believe how much time I spent 
hiking in the woods to find that view.
[Rosado] 
But to hear your experience, to know you 
understand, makes it all worth it!
[Alear] 
Finding beautiful things, then sharing them with 
friends who would never see them otherwise...
[Alear] 
You've found a lovely hobby, Rosado. I can't 
wait for your next piece.
[Rosado] 
Aw, sweet of you to say!
[Rosado] 
But if you're expecting more, I need to raise 
the stakes.
[Rosado] 
Hey, maybe you could help me! There's a spot 
I wanna get to, but it's a tough hike.
[Rosado] 
It would definitely help to have a buddy.
[Alear] 
I'd love to come along!
[Rosado] 
Great! Thanks so much!

...
[Rosado] 
Need some water?
[Alear] 
Thanks...
[Alear] 
Phew.
[Alear] 
We've come a long way. Are we close?
[Rosado] 
If the rumor I heard in town is true, yeah, we 
should be.
[Alear] 
Rumor? We came all this way for a rumor?
[Rosado] 
Yep. Quite a rumor, though.
[Rosado] 
The spot we're looking for is supposed to have 
a view worth any risk to see.
[Rosado] 
If it's even close to true, nothing can keep me 
from it. Not distance, not exhaustion, not thirst!
[Alear] 
I admire your passion for your work, Rosado.
[Rosado] 
More like a passion for everyone's likes, 
but thanks.
[Alear] 
"Likes"?
[Rosado] 
Oh─you know, smiles, compliments. All the 
ways people enjoy my work.
[Rosado] 
Every time I hear someone liked a drawing, I'm 
that much happier─and more motivated!
[Alear] 
It's definitely uplifting when someone can see 
and appreciate what you do.
[Rosado] 
Speaking of, we're almost there. Come on!
[Rosado] 
The drawing's important, but so's the journey 
to get there. Let's enjoy it─you and me!
[Alear] 
Lead on, Rosado.

[Alear] 
Your rendition of that landscape came out 
stunning, Rosado.
[Alear] 
I saw it on display in the café. Everyone who 
walked by seemed to stop and stare at it.
[Rosado] 
Oh, I'm so glad! It was worth the trip, right?
[Alear] 
It was. Even if we almost drowned crossing that 
river on the way.
[Alear] 
And that pack of wolves that chased us?! 
I really thought we were going to die...
[Alear] 
But that's all just fond memories now. And the 
view we found made it all worth it.
[Rosado] 
Thanks again for coming with.
[Rosado] 
I couldn't have drawn that piece without 
your help.
[Alear] 
I've been meaning to ask you, Rosado─is your 
passion for art really only about "likes"?
[Rosado] 
What?
[Alear] 
Watching you draw that day, it felt like maybe 
you had another goal...beyond validation.
[Rosado] 
I guess...I do?
[Rosado] 
The world is filled with so much beauty. Most 
people only get to see a little of it.
[Alear] 
True. It's impossible for people to see 
everything on their own.
[Rosado] 
That's such a waste, isn't it?
[Rosado] 
There are forms of beauty out there we don't 
even have names for. Unique, precious things.
[Rosado] 
If I can show people even a little more of the 
diversity in the world, I'll be happy.
[Rosado] 
It'll mean I've helped build a world where folks 
accept and appreciate each other's differences.
[Alear] 
Opening minds by showing them new things... 
Didn't know you were such a profound thinker.
[Rosado] 
Haha! Maybe I'm just showing off.
[Alear] 
Not at all. I have a lot of respect for you, 
Rosado. Even more now.
[Rosado] 
Thank you. That means a lot.
[Rosado] 
Wanna join me the next time I go looking for a 
new landscape to draw?
[Alear] 
I'd love to. I'm eager to see what you show 
me next!

[Rosado] 
Hey, Divine One. You think I'm cute, right?
[Alear] 
Of course. You're adorable.
[Rosado] 
Glad we're on the same page. That should 
make this easier.
[Rosado] 
Since I'm currently the cutest person in your 
life, there's something I want you to have.
[Alear] 
Uh, OK?
[Rosado] 
Here it is. What do you think, Divine One?
[Alear] 
A hair clip? It's beautiful.
[Rosado] 
Nothing but the best. I got it back home, in the 
village of the fair folk.
[Alear] 
I'm grateful, but why are you giving this to me?
[Rosado] 
Because if you wear it, then you'll be the cutest 
person in your life.
[Alear] 
Me? The cutest?
[Rosado] 
That's right. As an expert on the subject, 
I believe I'd know.
[Rosado] 
In fact, you wouldn't just be the cutest in your 
own life. You'd be the cutest in mine too.
[Alear] 
...
[Rosado] 
I'm sure you understand it isn't easy for me 
to admit something like that.
[Rosado] 
But I can't help it. You're that special to me, 
Divine One.
[Alear] 
That deserves a like.
[Rosado] 
Hehe, what?
[Alear] 
I'm glad you said something. I feel the same 
way about you, Rosado.
[Alear] 
You're my closest friend. I'm so grateful to be a 
part of your life.
[Rosado] 
Aw, Divine One...
[Alear] 
So... There's something I want you to have 
as well.
[Rosado] 
The Pact Ring? This is a precious gift. Are you 
sure you want me to have it?
[Alear] 
I can't just give you a like and leave it at that. 
This is a gesture more in line with how I feel.
[Rosado] 
In that case, I'll happily accept. It's an adorable 
ring, after all. Fitting that it came from you.
[Rosado] 
And since this kind of cuteness goes with 
everything, I think I'll wear it all the time.
[Alear] 
Please do. Nothing would make me happier.
[Rosado] 
Let it serve as a reminder of our everlasting 
friendship then, .
[Rosado] 
No matter what happens, as long as you see this 
on my finger, you know I'll be there for you.
