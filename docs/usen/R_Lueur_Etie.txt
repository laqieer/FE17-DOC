[Alear]
Hahaha!
[Etie]
Huh?
[Etie]
What's up? You're looking at me kinda weird.
[Alear]
Sorry. I didn't mean any offense. I just couldn't
help it.
[Etie]
Is there something wrong with how I look?
[Alear]
Oh, no! Nothing like that!
[Etie]
Then tell me why you're laughing already.
[Alear]
Hahaha!
[Alear]
Well, you know how you're always
so confident?
[Etie]
Huh?
[Alear]
I was thinking about how plain it is on
your face.
[Alear]
There's confidence all over you. It's kind of
inspiring to look at.
[Etie]
Which is why you were staring.
[Alear]
Forgive me, Etie. If it bothers you, I'll stop.
[Etie]
Nah, I don't mind. I'm actually a little honored
to help out the Divine One.
[Etie]
If staring at me lifts your mood, go ahead and
stare all you want.
[Alear]
Thank you!
[Etie]
I mean, it's a little embarrassing, but a quick
jog will help get my mind off it.
[Etie]
See you around, Divine One!
--- B ---




[Etie]
I see you're staring at me again, Divine One.
[Alear]
I was. Again. Sorry, I just can't help it.
[Etie]
You know I don't mind. It's pretty neat, in fact.
[Etie]
That said, I can think of better ways for you to
feel good than just admiring my confidence.
[Alear]
Such as?
[Etie]
A hundred laps around the Somniel!
[Alear]
Like...running?!
[Etie]
Even I get stressed sometimes. And when I do,
I always go for a run.
[Etie]
As long as I'm running, my mind is empty.
It's like I'm sweating out all my troubles.
[Alear]
Huh. Still...are a hundred laps really necessary?
[Etie]
In my experience? Yes. Anything less runs the
risk of a few stray, lingering doubts.
[Etie]
So how about it? You interested?
[Alear]
Yes. I think.
[Etie]
Great. Let's get started!
[Alear]
You mean now?!
[Etie]
No time like the present! Do you wanna get
confident or not?
[Alear]
I hadn't planned on running a hundred laps
today. But I guess it's worth a try.
[Alear]
You're on, Etie! Let's go for a run!
[Etie]
Now you're talking!
--- A ---




[Etie]
How did you like our run the other day?
[Alear]
That was my first time ever doing 100 laps
around anything. I slept like a baby afterward.
[Alear]
And then came the muscle aches the
next morning.
[Etie]
Oops. I should've warned you about that.
[Alear]
But the run itself was just like you said!
[Alear]
When I ran, I could feel my troubles fade away.
There was nothing on my mind but the run.
[Alear]
It was honestly pretty strange.
[Etie]
So you get it now! Oh, it's such an honor to
be able to do that for you.
[Etie]
But we're not done yet. Next time, I'd like you
to try some muscle balm afterward.
[Alear]
Some what now?
[Etie]
You have to let yourself recover after serious
exercise or your muscles will complain again.
[Alear]
Ahh. That makes sense.
[Alear]
If I keep jogging with the muscle balm you
mentioned, will I be as confident as you?
[Etie]
Of course. It works for me, and I'm just a
normal person.
[Etie]
The Divine One on this program? You'd be so
confident that you might actually start glowing.
[Alear]
Hehe, the way you say it, I almost believe it
could happen.
[Alear]
I was content before to be inspired by your
confidence, but with these exercises...
[Alear]
Maybe I could be the one inspiring others, just
like you did for me. You've helped a lot, Etie.
[Etie]
Aww, Divine One. You're gonna make me blush.
[Etie]
This seems like a good time for a quick jog.
I'll see you later!
[Alear]
Wait! I think I embarrassed her into going on
another run.
[Alear]
Well, that's OK. If I follow her, I can get in a few
laps around the Somniel myself!
--- S ---




[Etie]
What is going on with you lately? You keep
jogging solo, like you're avoiding me.
[Alear]
The thing is...
[Etie]
If it was something I said or did, I apologize.
Seriously.
[Alear]
Let me finish! There's something that's been
on my mind.
[Alear]
No matter how much I run, I can't shake it off.
I don't know what to do.
[Alear]
Sorry about this, but can I get something off
my chest?
[Etie]
Go right ahead.
[Alear]
I'd really like for us to partner up.
[Etie]
Uh...
[Etie]
Sure. That sounds good.
[Alear]
What?! Just like that?
[Etie]
You mean like training partners, right? Someone
to spot your workouts?
[Alear]
Well...that's not exactly it.
[Alear]
I meant supporting each other no matter what.
That's why I'm giving you the Pact Ring.
[Etie]
Uh...
[Etie]
For real?!
[Etie]
You can't mean that, right? Why would you
give me something so important?
[Alear]
Partly because of your confidence. I feel
stronger just by being around you.
[Alear]
But you're also kindhearted and determined.
It's the right choice.
[Alear]
I've been wanting to bring it up for a while now,
but I was afraid you'd say no.
[Etie]
So that's why you've been jogging alone.
[Alear]
Yeah.
[Etie]
Well, you can stop worrying. From now on,
we'll always jog together.
[Etie]
You and me are gonna run side by side for
a million laps before we're through.
[Alear]
So you'll accept?
[Etie]
Sure. Whatever I can do to help.
[Alear]
Thank you! This is such a load off my mind.
[Etie]
Thinking about this has got me all keyed up.
I could go for a run to burn off the energy.
[Etie]
What do you say? Dead sprint around the
Somniel until we can't move?
[Alear]
That sounds wonderful. I'm ready if you are!
[Etie]
Then let's get moving, . Last one
back to the Somniel is a rotten egg!
