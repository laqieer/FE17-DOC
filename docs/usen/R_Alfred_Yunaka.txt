=== Alfred & Yunaka ===
--- C ---


[Yunaka]
Ooo, look what I found! It's an Alfred! Fancy
meeting one of those in a place like this!
[Alfred]
Hey, Yunaka! You, uh, settling in OK?
[Yunaka]
Abso-totely! Everyone's been a tasty treat.
[Yunaka]
If anything, the welcome's been almost a little
too warm, y'know?
[Yunaka]
I'm an unknown quantity. I could be anybody!
What if I was a somebody? Who would know?
[Yunaka]
It's weirdly convenient no one's been checking
on me to try to find out.
[Alfred]
Oh. Should I be snooping more?
[Yunaka]
Seems like a logical course of action, that's all
I'm saying.
[Alfred]
Well, I do wanna get to know you better.
[Alfred]
So yeah. We should talk more, when we get
the time.
[Yunaka]
Talk? Is that your idea of gathering intel?
Are you really gonna go that easy on me?
[Yunaka]
Think about it, chum! I could be an enemy spy!
[Alfred]
Probably not, though. I trust you.
[Yunaka]
Forsooth, silly lad! Whence comes this
unearned confidence?!
[Yunaka]
Have you never once been betrayed? Swindled?
Double-crossed? Bamboozled?!
[Alfred]
Haha, I get that question a lot!
[Yunaka]
Gets that question a lot, he says! Not a bit of
self-awareness on this guy!
[Yunaka]
I don't get you, Alfred. But maybe I shouldn't
look this gift knife in the serrated bevel.
[Yunaka]
If you trust me, I appreciate it. Thanks.
[Alfred]
Anytime, Yunaka!

[Alfred]
So, where are you from?
[Yunaka]
Ooo, look at you! Shootin' off questions like
barbed arrows outta camouflage!
[Yunaka]
Set an ambush like that and you're liable to
drag a straight answer out of me.
[Alfred]
Great! So let's have it.
[Yunaka]
Uh... Dang...
[Yunaka]
Somewhere in, uh...Brodia.
[Alfred]
Oh, I see. Thanks for opening up.
[Yunaka]
Listen, could I ask you to keep a lid and, like,
eight padlocks on this particular jar?
[Yunaka]
Things could get unpleasant for me if this gets
out and folks start connecting dots.
[Alfred]
Gotcha. My lips are sealed.
[Yunaka]
Thanks, Alfred. Look, I know you want us to
talk more, but it's not quite that simple.
[Yunaka]
It could get really bad for both of us if you ask
me the wrong kinds of questions.
[Alfred]
Oh, uh...
[Yunaka]
I've got a lot to hide.
[Yunaka]
And I don't want to lie to you, but if you put me
in that position then I absolutely will.
[Yunaka]
Because it's far preferable to the trouble that
could find you if you learn too much about me.
[Yunaka]
I'm sorry that's how it has to be, but...
[Alfred]
No, no. I get it. I won't push you.
[Alfred]
I'm not out to make you uncomfortable.
[Yunaka]
I appreciate that, Alfred. Truly.
[Alfred]
But I said last time I wanted to talk more with
you, and that's what I'm gonna do.
[Alfred]
It doesn't have to be personal stuff. We can talk
about anything. Like our favorite flowers!
[Yunaka]
Yes! Love it! Henceforth, your brain's gonna
be stuffed with obscure weapon factoids!

[Yunaka]
Golly, that's weird to think about...
[Alfred]
What is?
[Yunaka]
Where I'd be if I hadn't heard Micaiah's voice
in that ring. I wouldn't be here at all, would I?
[Yunaka]
It's kind of unnerving to think this great change
in my life hinged completely on a coincidence.
[Alfred]
Nah. It's no coincidence that you're one of
us now.
[Alfred]
It's just you being you.
[Yunaka]
What do you mean?
[Alfred]
You're here because you wanted Micaiah's wish
to come true.
[Alfred]
Thanks to your big heart, we're allies now.
I'm glad to have you on the team!
[Yunaka]
Aww... Shuckers, Alfred!
[Yunaka]
You're the one with the big heart, though.
Honestly.
[Yunaka]
Compared to you...I'm a coward.
[Yunaka]
I've hidden who I really am, all the things I've
done, just for the chance to belong here.
[Yunaka]
If you knew the whole truth about me, I'd have
so much more to worry about.
[Yunaka]
I think you'd do more than merely despise me.
I think you'd actually come after me.
[Alfred]
Hmm...no. No, I wouldn't.
[Yunaka]
What do you mean you wouldn't?! You can't
just say you wouldn't!
[Yunaka]
I've been filling your head with weapon facts!
You barely know a thing about me!
[Yunaka]
You can't accept me for who I am without even
knowing who that is! It's not right... It's unfair.
[Alfred]
Let it be unfair, then. I'm fine with that.
[Alfred]
I'm fine not knowing your past too.
[Alfred]
I trust you, Yunaka. I always will.
[Yunaka]
Come on, Alfred...
[Alfred]
I don't have to explain why I trust you.
[Alfred]
Just like you don't have to prove that I should
trust you.
[Yunaka]
You are...so weird.
[Yunaka]
I mean, I know I'm bizarre, but you're a whole
new breed of bird.
[Alfred]
Hahaha, you got me there!
[Alfred]
From one weird bird to another, I hope we stay
friends for a long time.
[Yunaka]
Me too.
