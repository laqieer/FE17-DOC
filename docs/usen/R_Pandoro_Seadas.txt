[Seadall] 
At last... I think I finally got the steps down.
[Pandreo] 1 

[Pandreo] 
Seadall, your movement is so...graceful.
[Seadall] 
As it should be. I am a professional dancer.
[Pandreo] 
You know, watching you is giving me the urge 
to cut a rug myself.
[Pandreo] 
What do you say? Wanna dance together?
[Seadall] 
Yes, if you'd like.

[Pandreo] 
Flawless finish! That ought to go down in 
history as the best dance ever!
[Seadall] 
Eh, Pandreo...
[Seadall] 
I've never danced like...that. The movements... 
they don't match the rhythm. At all.
[Seadall] 
I understand why the others call it the Dance of 
Darkness. What a grotesque pantomime.
[Pandreo] 
Really? I had a great time.
[Seadall] 
A great time? Is that enough for you?
[Pandreo] 
Um... Define "enough."
[Seadall] 
I take it you like to dance, yes? Well, to really 
and truly dance, you have to work at it.
[Pandreo] 
Hmm. So that's how it goes, huh?
[Seadall] 
Yes, that's exactly how it goes. But don't worry, 
I'll teach you to dance correctly.
[Pandreo] 
All right, if you insist! I doubt it'll take me too 
long to pick it up.

[Seadall] 
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[Seadall] 
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[Pandreo] 
Ughhh!
[Pandreo] 
Seadall, you're counting wrong! It's messing 
up my flow!
[Seadall] 
No. You're not staying on the beat.
[Pandreo] 
I can't help it! I've been dancing to my own 
beat for so long.
[Seadall] 
Hmm. We have to break your old habits and 
really hammer home a solid foundation.
[Pandreo] 
You're saying I can't dance the way I want?
[Seadall] 
I'm sorry, but no. It's for your own good.
[Pandreo] 
Urgh...
[Seadall] 
Look, when I started, I couldn't dance a single 
step. But my master worked with me, tirelessly.
[Seadall] 
Sometimes the training was so hard, I wanted to 
run away. But now, I'm grateful for all of it.
[Seadall] 
And now I can teach you to dance, Pandreo, 
just like my master taught me.
[Pandreo] 
I never asked you to do that.
[Seadall] 
But...I thought you wanted to learn to dance?
[Pandreo] 
I wanted to have fun, and this? This is not fun.
[Pandreo] 
Thanks for your tutelage or whatever. Brief as 
it was.
[Seadall] 
Pandreo, wait! The lesson's not over!

[Pandreo] 
♪Mmm mmm mmm...♪
[Seadall] 
Pandreo.
[Pandreo] 
Oh. Hey, Seadall. If you're trying to spring 
another lesson on me, I'm not interested.
[Seadall] 
After everything I taught you...your rhythm is 
still just so awful.
[Pandreo] 
So...what? Did you come here only to 
insult me?
[Seadall] 
No, not at all. Honestly, I was just watching you 
dance...and I realized that I was wrong.
[Pandreo] 
Huh?
[Seadall] 
Enjoying the dance─that's what's important.
[Seadall] 
I decided to teach you because I thought you 
were having a hard time with it.
[Seadall] 
That's how it looked, anyway. But just now, 
you were dancing and loving it. I could see it.
[Pandreo] 
I mean, yeah. I was having fun.
[Seadall] 
That's all that matters.
[Seadall] 
If my master heard me now, he'd be angry with 
me. But it's something I needed to learn.
[Seadall] 
Pandreo, I'm sorry I taught you not to 
enjoy dancing.
[Pandreo] 
Listen, Seadall.
[Pandreo] 
I just wanted to dance with you.
[Seadall] 
Really?
[Pandreo] 
Yeah. And I still want to. It's just that your 
lesson wasn't really my style.
[Pandreo] 
What do you say? Want to give it another try?
[Seadall] 
I'd be happy to.
[Seadall] 
Just dance to the beat of your heart. You can't 
go wrong if you do that.
[Pandreo] 
That's what I'm talking about! Come on, time to 
shimmy and shake in the name of fun! Ha!
[Pandreo] 
And then...how about another lesson? Nothing 
too tough. Just a quick, easy session.
[Seadall] 
Haha, I promise, my next lesson will be much 
more enjoyable.
