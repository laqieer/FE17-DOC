[Bunet]
Well, well. You're branching nicely. I'm sure you
will be delicious one day.
[Bunet]
In the meantime, I'll water you plenty so you
grow big and healthy.

[Mauvier]
Oh, is this your garden?
[Bunet]
Mauvier, what are you doing here?
[Mauvier]
Keeping guard. What manner of vegetables are
you growing?
[Bunet]
I plant a variety this time of year, though most
won't grow until later.
[Bunet]
Nothing is better than homegrown produce.
Cook it just a bit and you have a masterpiece.
[Mauvier]
You are also raising flowers. Are they for
cooking as well?
[Bunet]
Oh, no. These flowers are just for looking at.
And smelling.
[Bunet]
The scent of fresh flowers has a way of easing
the soul. Here, sniff.
[Mauvier]
Huh...
[Mauvier]
What a lovely fragrance.
[Mauvier]
You are correct. It is quite calming.
[Bunet]
You've been working too hard. Why not drop by
here to relax now and then?
[Mauvier]
That sounds...nice.
[Mauvier]
Yes. I believe I will come by from time to time.

[Mauvier]
What is this flower called? It has a wonderful
scent.
[Bunet]
Ah, that's jasmine. One of the most aromatic
flowers I grow.
[Mauvier]
Your garden is quite lovely. I admit, I have found
excuses to visit lately.
[Bunet]
It really means that much to you?
[Bunet]
I'll harvest some vegetables and cook up a nice
ratatouille. The taste will move you, I promise.
[Mauvier]
There's no need for you to go to such lengths.
[Mauvier]
Simply taking time to pause here occasionally
is more than enough for me.
[Bunet]
Everyone needs a little downtime. And they can
always use a good meal too.
[Mauvier]
...
[Mauvier]
I was one of the Four Hounds.
[Mauvier]
So now I work to protect the weak, as an act of
atonement for my past actions.
[Mauvier]
People suffer daily. I fail them by allowing
myself any pleasure, no matter how simple.
[Bunet]
Don't think like that.
[Mauvier]
I am sorry. It may be some time until I visit this
garden again. If ever.

[Mauvier]
Heh...
[Bunet]
Mauvier, I have some presents for you.
[Mauvier]
Are these vegetables from your garden?
[Bunet]
Yes. Appetizing, aren't they? They're for you.
[Mauvier]
Bunet. I told you I do not want to treat myself.
Not while others suffer.
[Bunet]
That's too bad. I suppose these vegetables will
just rot, then.
[Mauvier]
...
[Bunet]
Such a shame. I worked so hard to grow them.
[Mauvier]
...
[Mauvier]
Why do you pay so much attention to me?
[Bunet]
Hm. I suppose you remind me of the plants
from my garden. I want to help you grow.
[Bunet]
That scrumptious, fragrant goodness inside has
to be nurtured so it doesn't wither away.
[Mauvier]
Heh... You are trying to make me feel better
about my lot in life.
[Mauvier]
Do you truly believe I can grow, and not just
rot away?
[Bunet]
Hm... I don't think I can answer that for you.
You have to decide for yourself.
[Bunet]
In the meantime, seriously, eat these vegetables.
[Mauvier]
Yes. Of course.
[Bunet]
You can grill them if you like, but they'll really
shine if you let me cook them up for you.
[Mauvier]
Thank you, Bunet.
[Mauvier]
I shall continue looking for a way to grow so as
to not rot away. For you.
