[Alear] 
Huh?
[Amber] 
Oh. Hey, Divine One!
[Alear] 
Good evening, Amber. Did you hear those weird 
sounds just now? Was that you?
[Amber] 
Sure was. I was calling out to my old alpaca 
friends back in my hometown.
[Alear] 
Say again?
[Amber] 
My hometown is a quaint little alpaca hamlet. 
I grew up surrounded by them!
[Amber] 
Sometimes I get a little homesick and miss 
my fuzzy friends on the ranch...
[Amber] 
On my loneliest nights, I come out here, look up 
at the starry sky, and call to them.
[Alear] 
Ooh, so that's what that sound was...
[Amber] 
Those were the cries of an alpaca! I'm calling 
out to them in their language.
[Alear] 
Their...language?
[Amber] 
I know. I know. It sounds crazy. There's no way 
they can hear me from so far away...
[Amber] 
But this is how I get the sads out! When I call to 
them, it feels like they're right by my side.
[Alear] 
I don't think that's crazy. I'm sure your feelings 
are getting back to them somehow, Amber.
[Amber] 
Aw! Thanks, Divine One. You're so nice!

[Alear] 
Hello, Amber. Were you talking to the alpacas 
back home again?
[Amber] 
Hey, Divine One! I sure was.
[Alear] 
May I ask what you said to them just now?
[Amber] 
Oh. I said, "How's it going, fellas?"
[Alear] 
That's how you say that? Er, in the language 
of the alpacas?
[Amber] 
Totally. If I'd asked that back on the ranch, 
they'd have answered right away.
[Alear] 
Really?! That's pretty cute!
[Amber] 
Yeah! It is! It's super cute!
[Amber] 
I never imagined I'd end up shouting back to 
them from so far away.
[Amber] 
Truth is, I didn't like my hometown very much. 
Middle of nowhere, nothing cool for miles...
[Amber] 
All I could think about was getting out of there. 
"Someday I'll leave this sty and become a hero!"
[Amber] 
Now that I've become a retainer, I've started to 
miss home a lot more. I get kinda lonely...
[Amber] 
Aw, shoot. Sorry. I didn't mean to whine.
[Alear] 
It's OK. I'm here to listen. If you're lonely, I can 
stay with you for a while.
[Alear] 
I just hope I can be as fun to talk to as your 
alpaca friends back home.
[Amber] 
Are you kidding? I'd love to keep talking!
[Amber] 
I can even teach you some more of the alpaca 
language if you want.
[Alear] 
Sounds like fun.

[Amber] 
...
[Alear] 
Don't tell me... Was that, "I'm sad, and I wish 
I could see you all again"?
[Amber] 
D-Divine One?! When did you get here? 
How did you know what I was saying?
[Alear] 
I've heard you chatting with them a lot. I guess 
I'm picking up some of the language.
[Amber] 
For real?! Whoa.
[Alear] 
Whoa!
[Amber] 
Yeah! Whoa! Wait, what was your whoa for?
[Alear] 
You didn't hear that just now? It sounded like 
the far-off cry of a real alpaca!
[Amber] 
Aww, I missed it! What did they say?
[Alear] 
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...I think they 
said, "We'll visit when we have a free weekend."
[Amber] 
Really?! Aww! Those lovable furballs! I need to 
reply! Let me think...
[Amber] 
...
[Alear] 
"Don't worry, friends. You're welcome to visit 
at any time..."
[Amber] 
...
[Alear] 
"But the Divine One is here, so I'm doing OK. 
Take care of yourselves." Did I get that right?
[Amber] 
Yeah! That's exactly what I said!
[Amber] 
Incredible. It's like you're a native speaker! 
You really have the ears of an alpaca.
[Alear] 
I'm honored to hear that.
[Amber] 
This is great. Spending time with you makes me 
feel like I'm right back on the ranch.
[Alear] 
Oh? So I remind you of a farm animal?
[Amber] 
Huh? No! That's not what I meant! Sorry, that 
came out wrong.
[Alear] 
It's OK, Amber. I'm glad you feel that way. 
I don't want a friend like you to feel lonely.
[Amber] 
Whoa! Such intense kindness! Thanks, DD. 
You're the best.
[Alear] 
...
[Amber] 
Hmm... Let me guess. "You're welcome"?
[Alear] 
You got it!

[Amber] 
Here's my hometown...aaand this one is of my 
family's alpaca ranch back home...
[Amber] 
You can probably guess this next one. 
Here's a hint: it's an alpaca!
[Alear] 
I never knew you were so good at drawing, 
Amber. These illustrations are amazing.
[Amber] 
Aw, thanks!
[Alear] 
Looking through these is making me feel a 
little jealous.
[Alear] 
It's clear you love and miss your hometown. 
I can't even remember where my home is...
[Amber] 
Divine One...
[Amber] 
...
[Amber] 
Your home is right here.
[Alear] 
What? Right where?
[Amber] 
Right here beside me!
[Alear] 
Huh?!
[Amber] 
Listen, Divine One! If you're a legendary sword, 
I'll be the legendary sheath that protects you!
[Amber] 
If a battle leaves you dinged and scratched, I'll 
do everything I can to cover and heal you!
[Amber] 
And I'll always carry you back home...safe and 
sound, a thousand times over.
[Alear] 
Amber...
[Alear] 
No. That won't do. I'm happy you feel this way, 
but I...
[Amber] 
Y-you're right, Divine One. Sorry. That was way 
out of line, huh? Aw, man...
[Alear] 
No! That's not what I meant. If I'm a sword, 
then so are you. We're fighting together!
[Amber] 
Whoa...
[Alear] 
You dream of being a legendary hero, right? 
Well, I want to help you realize that dream!
[Amber] 
Divine One, I...
[Alear] 
I want you to wear the Pact Ring, Amber. 
Will you do that for me?
[Alear] 
All I need is a promise that you'll be a sword by 
my side.
[Amber] 
Yeah! I mean, yes! If that's your condition, 
then count me in!
[Alear] 
Let's build a peaceful world together, Amber.
[Alear] 
And then, someday...I want to visit your alpaca 
ranch back home.
[Amber] 
Of course! My hometown is your hometown.
[Amber] 
Thank you, Divine One. I'm so overwhelmed 
right now. I don't know what to say...
[Amber] 
Oh! I should let the alpacas back home know 
about this! They'll be thrilled!
[Amber] 
...
[Alear] 
Uh... That sounds like it might take a while. 
Save it for later! I want to be part of that too.
[Alear] 
Besides, I'd rather have you present in this 
moment for just a bit longer, you know?
[Amber] 
Oh! Sure thing, Divine Dragon !
[Amber] 
We're twin blades now, bound together forever! 
Even if you regret it later! Which you won't!
