It's Céline, Divine One. I hope I'm not intruding.


Being here brings back memories.
Mother used to bring Alfred and me here.
You slept in just the same way back then. The 
only difference is you did not wake.


Apologies! You startled me.
I should not have been shocked to see you rise. 
You do so every day now.
In any case... Good morning.


Ah. You're awake.
You rise with grace and dignity. I expected 
no less.


--- C2 ---

That was a longer walk than I thought. I hope 
the tea hasn't gone cold.


You're a heavy sleeper.
That's all right.
I'll set the tea here so you can enjoy the aroma.
These bright floral notes are bound to give you 
pleasant dreams.


Good, you're awake. The tea is still warm.
Let's enjoy it together, shall we?
It's one of my favorites.


Good morning.
I've brought tea to brighten your day.
Shall we partake?

It still feels odd to come here on my own.


Visiting you here has always carried...
an air of solemnity.
In the past, my family and I were always 
escorted in...
by Queen Lumera.


If you ever wish to talk, Divine One... 
about anything...
please know I would gladly lend you an ear.
Haha, perhaps I shouldn't trouble you about 
it first thing in the morning.


Morning.
Haha, your hair is rather a mess, Divine One.
I will go and fetch a comb for you.

Ah, the Somniel...
A stroll among such gorgeous flowers always 
put me at ease.


I wonder if the Somniel has folktales...
like those of the Firene royal palace.
I could believe the enchanting scenery here was 
home to a spirit or two.


Good morning.
I suppose all the folktales around here would be 
about you, wouldn't they?
Haha, that's quite a lovely...
and uplifting thought.


I pray you can put aside your cares enough...
to find joy in this serene and beautiful morning.

The most gorgeous flowers are in bloom this 
morning, Divine One!


I was going to bring you a blossom...
but I could not bring myself to pick it.
Beauty is given such precious little time to 
thrive already.


Good morning.
What do you say to a walk before breakfast?
I'd like to show you the place where these 
flowers are blooming.


Do you enjoy horticulture as much as I?
I tend the lovelies down by the pond, you know.
If you'd like to pay them a visit, I'd be happy to 
introduce you.


--- A2 ---

I greatly appreciate you lending me your ear 
as of late.


After the bandits...
I became concerned that I had grown weak. 
But your words reassured me.
You said that what I felt was not weakness, 
but kindness.
Perhaps someday I'll believe that.


Good morning. Let us make ready for the 
day's battle.
I am prepared to fight─both for Firene's peace 
and for you.
To that end, I will do whatever is necessary.


I am proud to fight for my nation.
But you fight for the entire world─and that is 
far more pressure.
If you ever need someone to talk to, I am here.

I've come to wake you, my friend.


Thank you again for the Pact Ring. Truly.
Alfred was perhaps a touch surprised to hear 
about it...
but he's very glad that I have a friend who will 
support me no matter what.
For me, it's a huge relief.
I've come to rely on you ever so much.
So I hope you will take good care of yourself 
throughout this war.
I do not think I could stand to lose you.


You wake gracefully...
like a flower in bloom.
And like the flowers here...
I intend to protect and look after you.


Good morning. I've brought your favorite tea 
for us to share.
We've taken tea together so often by now...
that I cannot do so anywhere without thinking 
of you.


--- S2 ---

I like coming here.
It's more special to me now.


Whatever battle brings...
whatever choices I must make...
I know now that I will always have someone 
who stands by me.
That knowledge fills me with confidence like 
never before.
With you by my side, my friend...
I feel as though I can withstand the most 
harrowing quandary.


Hm.
I have decided I will leave the Pact Ring here 
when we head out to battle.
I'd like it to remain as pure and beautiful...
as it is now─and as the friendship it represents.


No matter what happens...
I know I'll find comfort...
and support in your company.
Armed with that knowledge, I can confidently 
steel myself for any battlefield.
