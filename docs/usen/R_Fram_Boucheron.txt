[Boucheron] 
Why? Why would they do such a thing?
[Boucheron] 
It's just...not fair!
[Framme] 1 
[Framme] 
Hey. Boucheron, right?
[Boucheron] 
Yes. And you're...Framme, right?
[Boucheron] 
What...what is it? Do you...need me 
for something?
[Framme] 
Um, no. I'm fine.
[Framme] 
I heard somebody crying their eyes out and 
I got concerned, is all.
[Boucheron] 
Ah. Right. Sorry for worrying you. I'm all right.
[Framme] 
OK... But then what's with the sobbing?
[Boucheron] 
I was reading this book, and I just get so swept 
up in the story.
[Framme] 
A book did this to you?
[Boucheron] 
People tell me I cry too easily. The littlest thing 
is enough to set me off.
[Framme] 
OK, I gotcha. So what's this book about?
[Boucheron] 
Well, there are these siblings who are separated 
during a war and later meet again as enemies.
[Framme] 
Huh. Sounds interesting.
[Boucheron] 
I'd be happy to lend it to you after I'm finished.
[Framme] 
Thanks for the offer, but I'll pass. I don't really... 
Well, I'm not a big reader.
[Boucheron] 
Oh, now that's a shame.
[Boucheron] 
Ah! What if I read it to you instead?
[Framme] 
What?! That's sweet and all, but I couldn't ask 
you to read to me like a little kid.
[Boucheron] 
Think nothing of it. I know you'd love the story 
just as much as I do.
[Framme] 
In that case... Sure! Why not?

[Boucheron] 
"And with that, the long war was over. The two 
siblings would know peace at last.
[Boucheron] 
"There would be time for them to live simply 
and happily, and with each other. The end."
[Framme] 
...
[Framme] 
WAAAAAH!
[Framme] 
They finally...got reunited! Thank GOODNESS!
[Boucheron] 
I know! It's a relief, isn't it? I'm getting misty- 
eyed again just thinking about it.
[Framme] 
To be honest...you were crying so hard, 
I...missed some of the middle parts.
[Framme] 
But stillâ”€so good!
[Boucheron] 
That's great! I knew you'd love it!
[Framme] 
I totally get now why you cry at books.
[Framme] 
Who knew they could be so...beautiful? I've only 
read the boring ones, I guess.
[Boucheron] 
Well, there's a wide world of captivating ones 
out there if you're interested.
[Boucheron] 
If you liked what we just read, I can recommend 
something. It's set at an officers academy.
[Boucheron] 
The series is famous for its political intrigue and 
deep characters. It's up to 30 volumes now.
[Framme] 
Wow. That's a lot.
[Boucheron] 
I'd love to discuss it with you once you finish 
the whole set.
[Framme] 
Hm... I don't think I can get through 30 books 
on my own.
[Framme] 
But I can't have you read all that to me, 
obviously. So...don't hold your breath, OK?
[Framme] 
I'm just a really slow reader. I wouldn't want 
to keep you waiting.
[Boucheron] 
Oh...OK. If that's what you think best.
[Framme] 
Anyway, thanks! You definitely showed me how 
interesting books can be.
[Boucheron] 
Good. I'm glad to have shown you the light.

[Boucheron] 
Framme? I have a gift for you.
[Framme] 
For me?
[Boucheron] 
Here. I think you'll like it.
[Framme] 
Huh. Is this another book you want me to read?
[Boucheron] 
Just open it.
[Framme] 
OK...
[Framme] 
Wait a second.
[Framme] 
There aren't any words in here. It's blank!
[Boucheron] 
That's right.
[Framme] 
Boucheron, is this some kind of prank?
[Boucheron] 
No, no. There's a good reason why this book 
is blank.
[Boucheron] 
It's so you can write your own story.
[Framme] 
Write? Me?
[Boucheron] 
Yes. Since there aren't many books that interest 
you, I thought you might like writing better.
[Framme] 
There's no way I could write a whole book on 
my own.
[Boucheron] 
You don't need to write a good story. You could 
use it like a journal instead, if you want.
[Boucheron] 
I just think it'll be easier for you to read 
something you wrote yourself.
[Framme] 
Hm...
[Framme] 
All right, then. To start off, I'll write about the 
day we met.
[Boucheron] 
Of all places, that's where you're going 
to begin?
[Framme] 
Sure! I thought it was a sweet moment.
[Boucheron] 
What, with me bawling?
[Framme] 
Trust me, it was memorable. I can still picture 
every last tear rolling down your face.
[Boucheron] 
Hm-hm, well... So long as you let me read it for 
myself someday.
[Framme] 
Deal. As soon as it's done, you'll be the first 
to lay eyes on my masterpiece.
[Framme] 
Watch out, though. Gonna be a real tearjerker!
[Boucheron] 
I'll keep my hankie dry just in case.
