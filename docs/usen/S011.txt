[Alear]
Hey, look. It's started snowing...
[Micaiah]
I'm certain I've been here before...or someplace
just like it.
[Alear]
Where do you think we are, Micaiah?
[Micaiah]
This looks somewhat like Castle Nox. I battled
Ike there once.
[Alear]
Huh? Castle Nox? You fought against Ike?
[Micaiah]
It was snowing then too.
[Micaiah]
Ike was a strong commander, as was I. But we
each had a different definition of victory.
[Micaiah]
Ike was trying to save us, and I could not let
him. We needed help but not his.
[Micaiah]
My people were cursed by a magical blood pact
and headed for certain ruin.
[Alear]
What happened?
[Micaiah]
I fought Ikeâ”€fought to undo the pact. I held
on to hope.
[Micaiah]
I stayed focused on my vision of the future.
Even on the worst day, I kept hold of that.
[Micaiah]
I gave everything to protect people I cared for.
I'd have sacrificed more if there'd been need.
[Micaiah]
That vision is what made it possible for me to
survive the war.
[Alear]
I think I know now why we were brought here.
[Alear]
Teach me how you never broke in the face of
despair and fear, Micaiah.
[Micaiah]
So you've figured it out then? The point of
this trial?
[Micaiah]
Well then, face me in battle, .
And do your best to be victorious.
[Micaiah]
If you win, our bond will strengthen, and you'll
be able to draw on my power like never before.

[Micaiah]
Well done. You passed the trial safely.
[Alear]
Thank you, Micaiah.
[Micaiah]
Do you feel that? Our bond is stronger.
[Alear]
I do, yes. I feel like I understand you better
than before.
[Alear]
There's just one thing...
[Micaiah]
What's that?
[Alear]
You know...I was sort of hoping I might gain
some of your fortune-telling ability.
[Micaiah]
Haha! Don't worry, you don't need that.
[Micaiah]
You can already see the future. In fact, you're
building it.
[Alear]
I'm building the future? Is that one of
your predictions?
[Micaiah]
Nope. It's something I see right in front of me.
[Micaiah]
I see someone with the strength to never lose
heart, no matter what. You're a fighter.
[Alear]
It's an honor to know that you think so. I'll do
my best not to disappoint.
[Micaiah]
Not a chance. Come on, let's go save the world.

[Micaiah]
Relax
[Micaiah]
You've got to earn this, .
Defend yourself!

[Micaiah]
Let's finish this fight quickly. All units, attack!

[Micaiah]
I remember that battle as if it were yesterday.
[Micaiah]
It's almost like I'm there again. The past and
the future are together in my heart.

[Alear]
You're a strong combatant, but I'm not going
to lose!
[Micaiah]
Very well! I'd be let down if you held anything
back!

[Yunaka]
I've never been great at fighting magic users,
so...maybe go easy on me?
[Micaiah]
Sorry, but that's not the point of this. I won't be
holding back.
[Micaiah]
Relax
[Micaiah]
You took me from that shrine, and now it's
my turn to guide you to somewhere new.
[Yunaka]
Is that right? Guess I'd better be ready for
you, then!
