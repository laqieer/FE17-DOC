[Pandreo]
Ah, Divine One! Just the dragon I was hoping
to see. I could use a favor.
[Alear]
Oh? What kind of favor?
[Pandreo]
I'm hosting a party soon, and I'd like for you to
be there.
[Pandreo]
At our church, you're the center of our
everything─our deity!
[Pandreo]
I think your attendance would really raise
everyone's spirits.
[Alear]
Hmm. Tell me more about this party. What is it
going to be like?
[Pandreo]
Oh, nothing formal. Just an occasion to sing,
dance, and have a good time.
[Pandreo]
You can blow off some steam and lend an ear to
the other guests. Hear their stories.
[Alear]
That sounds fun, but... What does my listening
to people have to do with anything?
[Pandreo]
Don't you see? It would be incredibly
encouraging to everyone!
[Pandreo]
The first time I saw you with my own eyes was
like...like seeing the light!
[Alear]
Haha, you're coming on a little strong.
[Pandreo]
Excuse me. Got a little intense there, didn't I!
[Pandreo]
Anyway...it's short notice, so there's no need to
let me know right away.
[Pandreo]
But I'll tell you, I don't throw so-so parties.
If I'm hosting it, you know it'll be a blowout.
[Alear]
OK. I'll keep that in mind.
[Pandreo]
Thank you, Divine One.

[Alear]
Pandreo...I'm sorry, but after thinking about it,
I'm going to pass on the party invitation.
[Pandreo]
Ah, your schedule's full? That's too bad.
Maybe next time.
[Alear]
No, it's not about my schedule.
[Pandreo]
Oh. Then can I ask why?
[Alear]
From a distance, people may see me as a...
a god. But up close, I'm nothing special.
[Alear]
Why disappoint everyone by letting them find
out that the Divine Dragon is just...a person?
[Pandreo]
That's what you're worried about? I must have
given you the wrong impression.
[Pandreo]
Listen. When I was a boy, you saved my life.
[Alear]
What? How? I was asleep.
[Pandreo]
Well, my parents were...scummy, frankly. They
left my sister and me when we were little.
[Pandreo]
But a priest at the church turned my life around
with a little-known prophecy...
[Pandreo]
"When the dragon child rises from their slumber
on the dais, saved the world will be."
[Alear]
...
[Pandreo]
Screwed up as the world got, it would be saved.
That gave me the hope I needed to keep going.
[Pandreo]
And I'm not alone. The faithful have always
believed that you would awaken.
[Pandreo]
So no, you won't disappoint them. You're living
proof that their hopes are coming to pass.
[Alear]
I understand now.
[Alear]
All right, Pandreo. You've convinced me.
I'll come to that party of yours.
[Pandreo]
Thank you, thank you! Everyone will be thrilled
to see you there.

[Pandreo]
Pinch me. I mean, did that really happen?
[Pandreo]
Did I just go to a party with the actual
Divine Dragon?
[Alear]
I was glad to see everyone having a good time.
[Pandreo]
You gave them a reason to hold on to hope.
I can't thank you enough for that.
[Alear]
I should be thanking you. All the music and
merriment really did lift my spirits.
[Alear]
I'm feeling more hopeful myself.
[Pandreo]
And what did I tell you? Not one disappointed
face in the house.
[Alear]
True. I almost feel embarrassed that I passed
on your invitation at first.
[Alear]
I owe it to those people to stay strong.
[Pandreo]
One day you'll bring peace to the world.
[Pandreo]
And I'll help in whatever small way I can.
Together, we'll lead everyone to a better future.
[Alear]
Oh, I almost forgot. I have to ask you
about something.
[Pandreo]
Of course. What is it?
[Alear]
At one point, everyone started...howling.
What was that all about?
[Pandreo]
Oooh, uh... Em... That...um...
[Pandreo]
That's just a way members of my congregation
express their fervor. A little crass, I know.
[Pandreo]
Please erase it from your memory.
[Alear]
Sure thing! AROOO!
[Pandreo]
Divine One, please!
[Alear]
Hahah! Ooh, that was fun! Now I get the appeal!
--- S ---

[Alear]
AROOO! Hey there, Pandreo.
[Pandreo]
Divine One! I wish you wouldn't do the whole
howling thing. It's so beneath you.
[Alear]
OK, OK, if you say so.
[Alear]
Anyway, what's going on?
[Pandreo]
Well, there's something I'd like to talk to
you about.
[Pandreo]
...
[Pandreo]
I guess I'll just say it... I have feelings for
you, .
[Alear]
What?! Where did this come from all of
a sudden?
[Pandreo]
There's nothing sudden about it. I've felt like
this for a long time.
[Pandreo]
I know it must be sacrilegious─a cleric caring
this much for someone as holy as you...
[Pandreo]
But as a man of the cloth, I don't feel right
hiding this secret.
[Pandreo]
And it's OK, Divine One. I know you can't
commit yourself to a humble cleric like me.
[Pandreo]
I just appreciate you hearing what I had to say,
self-indulgent as it was. I should go now.
[Alear]
Please, wait.
[Pandreo]
Huh?
[Alear]
Who says a Divine Dragon and a cleric can't
commit themselves to each other? Tell me.
[Pandreo]
That would be...um...
[Alear]
Please, Pandreo. You helped me understand
something important...
[Alear]
You helped me understand what I mean to
people and what my role in all of this truly is.
[Alear]
You made me feel connected.
[Alear]
You are so precious to me. And yet, you say
I'm not allowed to feel like this?
[Pandreo]
Divine One...
[Pandreo]
No. No one can tell you how to feel or how not
to feel. No one.
[Alear]
Then please, take this. It's the Pact Ring. I want
you to wear it. I want you to be by my side.
[Pandreo]
...
[Pandreo]
If that's what you want from me...
[Alear]
Yes, Pandreo. That's what I want.
[Pandreo]
Did you feel that? Everything got just
a bit brighter.
[Alear]
Maybe that's my mother. Maybe she's letting us
know how happy this makes her.
[Pandreo]
Queen Lumera? I hope so.
[Alear]
When two people have feelings for each other
like we do, that can't be forbidden or denied.
[Alear]
You and I will walk hand-in-hand together
from now on.
[Pandreo]
Yes.
[Pandreo]
Divine One, I adore you. And no matter what
lies ahead, I will never let go of your hand.
