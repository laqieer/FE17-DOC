[Bunet] 
Merrin, your timing could not be more perfect. 
Please, take a seat.
[Merrin] 
What's this all about?
[Bunet] 
I want you to be the first to experience my 
newest recipe.
[Merrin] 
Oh. Is this for a cookbook?
[Bunet] 
For a restaurant, actually. I want to reestablish 
my parents' bistro after the war is over.
[Bunet] 
I have been crafting new dishes for the menu 
in my spare time.
[Merrin] 
That's great! What are you serving up today?
[Bunet] 
Stewed chicken.
[Merrin] 
Whoa! High marks on presentation.
[Bunet] 
Thank you. I found a rare breed of hen and 
simmered her at low heat for several days.
[Bunet] 
There's a variety of spices in the broth, 
including some with salubrious warming effects.
[Bunet] 
Here. Have a taste.
[Merrin] 
All right, let's give it a try. Here goes...
[Merrin] 
Mmm!
[Merrin] 
Incredible... The meat is so soft, it's practically 
melting in my mouth.
[Merrin] 
Even as the flavors mingle on my tongue, 
each ingredient is still unmistakably itself.
[Merrin] 
The spices don't blot out the umami taste of 
the chicken. They coexist in perfect harmony.
[Bunet] 
I've never heard my cooking described 
so beautifully.
[Merrin] 
An artful meal deserves an artful description.
[Merrin] 
You really know your way around a bird. This 
definitely deserves a spot on the menu.
[Bunet] 
I am glad to hear you say so. That makes all my 
hard work worthwhile.
[Bunet] 
Thank you for being my taster, Merrin.
[Merrin] 
It was seriously my treat. Thank you for the 
delicious meal.

[Merrin] 
Hey, Bunet. I heard you're interested in critters.
[Bunet] 
Pardon?
[Merrin] 
As it happens, I'm a fan myself. I know where to 
find some amazing ones in the wild.
[Merrin] 
How about I take you? My way of thanking you 
for that delicious meal.
[Bunet] 
Uh...
[Bunet] 
Thank you for the offer, but I'll decline.
[Merrin] 
Oh, really? You don't like wildlife watching?
[Bunet] 
That's not quite what I meant...
[Merrin] 
What did you mean, then?
[Merrin] 
Wait a second...
[Merrin] 
Oh no. I get it now.
[Bunet] 
Huh?
[Merrin] 
You prefer wildlife eating. Is that it?
[Bunet] 
What?!
[Merrin] 
Cooking with regular meat got boring, so you 
started sourcing meat from rare critters.
[Merrin] 
What was in that stew? Did you trick me into 
eating a falcon or something?!
[Bunet] 
Of course not! I assure you, it was chicken!
[Merrin] 
Liar! And I bet you're only cozying up to me so 
I'll show you my favorite wildlife spots.
[Bunet] 
Listen─
[Merrin] 
No, YOU listen. A crime against the animals is 
a crime against me.
[Merrin] 
So much as think about hurting another poor 
critter and you're done for.
[Bunet] 
Merrin, please. You have it all wrong.
[Merrin] 
I'll pluck and broil you myself. You hear me?
[Merrin] 
[Bunet] 
Ugh... I seem to excel at being misunderstood.

[Merrin] 
OK, Bunet. I came like you asked. What's this 
all about?
[Merrin] 
If you try to serve me a flamingo casserole 
or something, I swear, I'll─
[Bunet] 
You have it all wrong. Please, hear me out.
[Merrin] 
Huh?
[Bunet] 
I'm not interested in what you call "critters."
[Bunet] 
Rather, I am interested in...you.
[Merrin] 
...
[Merrin] 
Excuse me?
[Bunet] 
Though we both serve the royal family, we have 
never had a chance to become friends.
[Bunet] 
I admit, I was too intimidated to approach you. 
You're so confident and outgoing.
[Bunet] 
Always talking about critters this, critters that 
to anyone who will listen.
[Bunet] 
I began to hope that I could one day become 
friends with the Critter Keeper.
[Bunet] 
That's my nickname for you.
[Merrin] 
Ooh...
[Merrin] 
The Critter Keeper, huh?
[Bunet] 
Yes. Owing to how deeply you care for 
creatures of the wild.
[Bunet] 
It is a rather silly sobriquet, I know...
[Merrin] 
Silly? That's the best nickname I've ever heard! 
The Critter Keeper. Makes me sound so...heroic.
[Bunet] 
Aha, yes.
[Merrin] 
I'm sorry, Bunet. I had no idea you wanted to 
be friends.
[Merrin] 
Looks like I was all wrong about you.
[Bunet] 
There's no need to apologize. I am quite used 
to being misunderstood.
[Bunet] 
As a lifelong eccentric, it is something of a 
chronic condition for me.
[Merrin] 
Well, I'm a certified oddball myself, so I know 
the feeling.
[Merrin] 
Let's be friends from here on out, yeah? 
We oddballs have to stick together.
[Bunet] 
I would like that. To celebrate, would you like 
to try my latest dish?
[Bunet] 
You can even name it, if you feel so inclined.
[Merrin] 
What? Me? You want to put my words on 
your menu?
[Bunet] 
Yes. I was quite impressed by your lyrical 
review last time. Pick whatever name you like.
[Merrin] 
All right. Hm, what should I call it? Maybe I'll 
name it after a rare critter.
[Bunet] 
Yeah... You may want to avoid that. People 
might get the wrong idea...
[Merrin] 
Ah! Good point!
[Bunet] 
I am in no rush. Take your time with the food 
and allow inspiration to strike.
[Merrin] 
It would be my pleasure.
