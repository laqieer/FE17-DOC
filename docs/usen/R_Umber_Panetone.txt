[Amber] 
Ugh, I have to check that place out, but it's too 
dangerous to go by myself...
[Panette] 2 

[Panette] 
Pardon me, but I couldn't help overhearing... 
Are you planning a trip somewhere?
[Amber] 
Listen to this, Panette. There are rumors about 
a nearby forest that hides an old mansion...
[Panette] 
Oh? I have never heard of this place.
[Amber] 
Me neither! I just learned about it. According to 
local legends, a famous knight lived there.
[Amber] 
He was a brave and noble warrior who fought 
as if he would never die...right up until he died.
[Amber] 
The very next day, people say the knight's spirit 
could be seen wandering inside the mansion...
[Panette] 
How extraordinary!
[Amber] 
Poor guy doesn't know he died! Now he roams 
his own halls as a shadow of his former self.
[Panette] 
Would that not make him...a ghost?
[Amber] 
Oh, huh... Well, if you want to get all technical 
about it, then sure.
[Panette] 
Why, I should like to see this place for myself! 
I adore ghosts.
[Amber] 
You do?! Great! Let's check it out together.
[Amber] 
That'll be way, way easier than checking it out 
all by myself.
[Amber] 
Even Prince Diamant turned me down─and he's 
not afraid of anything!
[Panette] 
Then pray bring me along. I can think of nothing 
that would make me happier.
[Amber] 
Yes! That settles it. Just don't blame me if you 
get scared out of your big, pointy boots!

[Amber] 
We made it! We've arrived at the mansion.
[Amber] 
Ah...I'm trembling. My heart is pounding. I've 
got goosebumps!
[Panette] 
Hmm... Nary a ghost in sight... Let us keep going 
and explore further.
[Amber] 
Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You don't want to 
rush this. The ghost could be hiding anywhere...
[Panette] 
Oh, really? Like where?
[Amber] 
Mwa ha haaa...
[Amber] 
Why, the ghost could even be...right HEEERE!
[Panette] 
Hm?
[Panette] 
Are you certain? I see nothing.
[Amber] 
Uh...
[Amber] 
Oh, never mind. I was just trying to play a little 
trick on you, Panette.
[Amber] 
You didn't even flinch! You must have nerves 
of pure steel.
[Amber] 
Anyway, maybe this place isn't haunted 
after all.
[Panette] 
Hmm?
[Amber] 
I'm happy the mansion part of the rumors held 
up, but...a wandering ghost? I just don't see it.
[Panette] 
It is here...
[Amber] 
Aw, Panette! That's the spirit. Normally I'd be 
holding out hope too, but...
[Panette] 
No, Amber. It is here.
[Amber] 
Oh! I get you. I guess every house does have its 
own ghost, in a poetic way. That's really─
[Panette] 
That is not what I meant. It is HERE! 
As in...THERE! Look!
[Amber] 
Do what now?
[Amber] 
Whoa...
[Amber] 
Whoa.
[Amber] 
WHOA!

[Amber] 
Hey, Panette. I won't tell anyone about that 
"haunted mansion" incident if you don't...
[Amber] 
The rumors didn't say anything about a second, 
perfectly normal mansion being out there!
[Panette] 
Yes...and they were not exactly pleased to 
have company.
[Panette] 
How mortifying.
[Amber] 
I wish that was all. I thought that stuffy guy 
was the legendary knight! I shook his hand...
[Amber] 
I already told Prince Diamant. He laughed until 
he cried. Called me "the legendary knucklehead."
[Panette] 
The legendary knucklehead, you say...
[Panette] 
Hahaha! That's not bad!
[Amber] 
Oh, fine. Laugh it up. I should really learn to 
keep my big mouth shut...
[Amber] 
I'm really sorry I dragged you into that mess.
[Panette] 
Think nothing of it. I had a rather good time.
[Amber] 
You did? Even though we didn't see a ghost?
[Panette] 
Yes, well, that was unfortunate.
[Panette] 
I have a number of interests that other people 
find strange. Ghosts, for example.
[Panette] 
You are much the same in that respect. Some 
might consider you an odd duck, but...
[Panette] 
I like odd ducks!
[Amber] 
Huh. That doesn't FEEL like a compliment...
[Panette] 
Why, of course it is!
[Amber] 
Oh! Well, great!
[Amber] 
I was worried you regretted it, because...I was 
really glad you went with me, Panette.
[Amber] 
I don't know many people who enjoy chasing 
rumors and legends and stuff.
[Amber] 
If you ever need an adventure buddy to check 
out a legend of your own, just say the word.
[Panette] 
I know a legendary spot we can go to.
[Amber] 
You do? Where?!
[Panette] 
A restaurant with very, very spicy food.
[Amber] 
Uh, is the food enchanted? Or was it built on 
an ancient burial ground? Or...
[Panette] 
They have a dish called the Tongue Melter... It's 
so hot, no one has ever finished an entire bowl!
[Amber] 
Ooh, it's that kind of legend.
[Amber] 
Well, a legend is a legend. Count me in─and I'll 
foot the bill! Least I can do.
[Panette] 
Huzzah!
