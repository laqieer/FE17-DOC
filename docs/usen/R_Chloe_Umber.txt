[Amber]
Chloé! Listen up, I have something that's gonna
blow your mind!
[Chloé]
Heh, what's got you so riled up?
[Amber]
You've heard of the Fountain of Youth, right?
Y'know, from those fairy tales you love?
[Chloé]
Oh, those are some of the best stories. But why
do you ask?
[Amber]
Hahaha!
[Amber]
Brace yourself... I got my hands on the only map
to its hidden location!
[Chloé]
Wow... That's unbelievable!
[Chloé]
Especially since the Fountain of Youth isn't real.
Why would it be on a map?
[Amber]
That's exactly it! That's why this is so amazing.
[Amber]
If it doesn't exist, then why do I have a map
that shows its precise location?!
[Amber]
So? Whaddaya say, Chloé? Wanna join me on a
quest to find the Fountain of Youth?
[Amber]
You know all about this fairy-tale stuff. If we
team up, we'll be unstoppable!
[Chloé]
Sure, I'll tag along.
[Chloé]
Maybe on the way, we'll see some nice
landscapes right out of a fairy tale.
[Amber]
Really?! Great! Thanks!
[Amber]
I can't wait. Let's go find that fountain!

[Chloé]
Well, I think the spring is lovely. And doesn't
that cool water feel nice?
[Amber]
Yeah... I guess.
[Amber]
But this isn't the Fountain of Youth!
[Chloé]
Haha, that's all right.
[Chloé]
Yes, this is a normal spring, but you're still so
young. You don't need the Fountain of Youth.
[Amber]
That's not the point. We came here on a quest
to find a legendary fountain.
[Amber]
I can't believe this stupid map was a fake the
whole time. Ugh... I'm such a sucker.
[Chloé]
Aww, don't feel down, Amber.
[Amber]
I also can't believe you're so chipper about
this, Chloé.
[Chloé]
Even if it's not the Fountain of Youth, I'm happy
enough to visit such a beautiful spring.
[Chloé]
It's so lovely that it might have inspired the
tales of the Fountain of Youth to begin with.
[Amber]
Hmm. I guess it is a beautiful little spring...
[Chloé]
Right? So don't be sad. Besides, I packed some
food we can eat while we take in the scenery.
[Amber]
You did?! Aw, yeah! Good move, Chloé. You
always think ahead.
[Amber]
Pretty scenery, a tasty lunch... This is turning
out more like a weekend picnic or something.
[Amber]
Woo! Weekend picnic!
[Amber]
Wait a second.
[Amber]
You... You planned this all along, didn't you?
You knew this quest would be a dud!
[Chloé]
Hahaha! Does it matter?
[Amber]
Nah. I'm too hungry to stay mad now. Bring on
the grub!
[Chloé]
Here you go. One plate of dried fish eyeballs,
just for you.
[Amber]
Aaaugh! One of your funky folk-food lunches?
Now this quest is definitely a dud...

[Amber]
Heeey! Hey, Chloé!
[Chloé]
Hi, Amber. In a good mood today, huh?
[Amber]
Ooo, I sure am. Wait until you hear this.
[Amber]
I found another map...and this one leads to a
forbidden labyrinth!
[Amber]
It's a legendary maze of tunnels and pits that's
supposed to lead to the other side of the world.
[Chloé]
Unbelievable! Where did you get this map from?
[Amber]
This sweet little street vendor guy said it was─
get this─my destiny to buy it from him.
[Amber]
He was grinning the whole time. He must have
sensed my passion for seeking out legends!
[Chloé]
Hah, I'm sure he did.
[Amber]
Don't worry, Chloé. I won't invite you to join
me this time.
[Chloé]
Oh. How come? Did you not like the lunch
I prepared for our last adventure?
[Amber]
What? No! That was a really nice meal...once I
got past the eyeballs.
[Amber]
I just feel like I dragged you on a wild fountain
chase, y'know?
[Amber]
I'm super sure this map is real...but I'll check it
out myself just to be super, super sure.
[Chloé]
That's too bad. I would have liked to join you.
[Amber]
What? You're serious?
[Chloé]
Of course!
[Chloé]
After all, we're not really out to find some
mystical, legendary ruin, right?
[Chloé]
We're out to have a fun time looking for it!
Just like the heroes in stories.
[Amber]
Whoa! That's exactly why quests are the best.
You totally get me!
[Chloé]
Sure. I've seen how your eyes sparkle as we
close in on the X on your map.
[Amber]
In that case... Chloé, would you care to join me
on another legendary quest?
[Chloé]
Definitely. And this time, I'll pack some extra-
special lunches for us.
[Amber]
Great! Just, uh...go easy on the folk food, OK?
