=== Chapter 24 Recollections ===

(Mountainous Region)
Armed with a powerful artifact
from Zephia, the party heads to a
lake in pursuit of a sunken shard.

--- OP ---




[Alear]
It's hard to believe that there was a mountain
right here where this lake is.
[Veyle]
I sense a Fell Dragon Shard here.
Zephia was telling the truth. It is out there─very
deep at the bottom of this lake.
[Alear]
She said the enchanted crystal would bring
that whole submerged area into reach.
[Veyle]
But it will last only a few hours. So, once it
happens, I'll lead us to the shard quickly.
[Alear]
Thank you.
[Veyle]
OK. Here goes...
[Alear]
It's starting! But...wait, what's happening?
[Veyle]
The mountain is rising! Or...or the lake is
draining! Everyone, stay together.
[Alear]
No, it's not safe here...
[Alear]

[Veyle]
Brother!
[Alear]

[Veyle]
Sister!
[Veyle]

[Alear]
Veyle!



[Alear]
I must have been thrown far from the others.
The lake is gone! The mountain is...here!
I guess the crystal worked. Now, I'd better
find the others.

. [Alear]
You there.
[Alear]
Huh?
...
[Alear]
How strange. Your face is my face.
[Alear]
No, what? That can't be...me.
[Alear]
Who are you?
[Alear]
Well, I'm... Uh...
[Alear]
I sense an Emblem. One I have never
sensed before.
If you have a ring, give it to me. I need to take it
to Father.
[Alear]
Father?
[Alear]
Sombron. The king of dragons.
[Alear]
...
[Alear]
I collect Emblem Rings. It is my duty.
I have been taught to do what I must to fulfill
that duty.
We are currently at war with the Divine
Dragons. I have collected many rings.
[Alear]
At war... Wait, if this is me...is this me during
the war with the Divine Dragons?
Zephia's magic put me in reach of the shard,
all right─by throwing me into the past!
I must be in Gradlon a thousand years ago,
before it all sank, when the shard was near here.

[Alear]
You are mumbling. I will repeat myself. If you
have a ring, give it to me. Quickly.
[Alear]
I'm sorry, but no.
[Alear]
Your answer must be yes. I cannot let you go
with that ring. If I disobey Father...
I will be killed. Many of my sisters and brothers
have been killed.
[Alear]
Killed?
[Alear]
One older brother was drowned. One older
sister was burned alive.
A little sister and little brother─they were
cute─were torn apart by the Corrupted.
Some siblings died in the war. Most were
defects. Father disposed of them.
[Alear]
Disposed of?
[Alear]
The defects require disposal. But I am not
a defect.
I collect rings to prove that. Father must get
his wish. Until then, I will collect rings.
[Alear]
And when his wish comes true, what then?
What will you do?
[Alear]
What will I... Oh. Well...
[Alear]
What was that?!
[Alear]
That is an avalanche. They are common to
this place.
But I hear some of the Corrupted nearby.
They are agitated. That is unusual.
There are, maybe...intruders.
[Alear]
The others must be here somewhere... I'm sorry,
but I have to go!
[Alear]
[Alear]
The stranger with my face is escaping. I will
prevent that.
I must pursue them. I need your help...
Marth.

[Alear]
There you are!
[Alfred]
Thank goodness you're safe! We weren't sure
where to find you.
[Veyle]
Brother, I'm so glad we finally found each
other─after the earth shook like that!
[Veyle]
Sister, I'm so glad we finally found each
other─after the earth shook like that!
I know where the Fell Dragon Shard is. It's a
short climb from here.
[Alfred]
Unfortunately, we've been followed. You won't
believe by who...
[Alear]
Huh?
[Alfred]

[Veyle]

[Zephia]
All of you! I insist that you tell me at once,
exactly who you are.
[Alear]
Zephia?!
[Zephia]
Whom do you serve? Fighting the Corrupted as
you did back there, defeating them with ease...
No one on our side has reported seeing anyone
like this. And surprises are not well received.

[Ivy]
What's going on? I thought she died.
[Ivy]

[Veyle]
She did die. Zephia shouldn't be standing in
front of us.
She doesn't look like one of the Corrupted.
But also, she doesn't even know us.
[Alear]
Everyone, this will be a shock, but that is
Zephia, a thousand years ago.
Because we are in Gradlon a thousand years
ago, during the war.
[Veyle]
What?!
[Alear]
The crystal was supposed to put us in reach of
the submerged shard. It did, in a way.
But not by raising mountains or draining lakes.
It sent us back in time.
Believe it or not, I just met my past self.
That's how I figured it out.
[Veyle]
[Alfred]
Your what?!
[Alfred]

[Veyle]
Oh, that can't be good...
[Alear]
I have found you.
[Alear]
...
[Veyle]
Brother, that's... That's you!
[Veyle]
Sister, that's... That's you!
[Alear]
Yes, it is.
[Veyle]
Red eyes, red hair, but it's you!
[Veyle]
Red eyes, red hair, but it's you!
That's what you looked like when we first met...
[Alear]
Zephia, please step aside. I will take care of
this situation.
[Zephia]
Thank you, Your Highness. But I'm more than
happy to assist you.
[Alear]
That will not be necessary. Go, inform Father
what is happening here.
Also, that I sense the presence of Emblems
from them.
[Zephia]
They possess Emblem Rings?
[Alear]
It is possible.
[Zephia]
Understood. I'll head to the temple.
[Zephia]

[Alear]
She's going to tell Sombron that we're here!
We have to hurry!
[Alfred]

[Veyle]
Brother...I can't bring myself to hurt you.
And that's you in our way.
[Alfred]

[Veyle]
Sister...I can't bring myself to hurt you.
And that's you in our way.
What should we do? We need to break the
shard, but...
[Alear]
Is that what you're trying to do? Break
the shard?
[Alear]
What if it was? Would you let us pass by?
[Alear]
No, that is stupid. I cannot return home without
your rings.
We will fight. If I win, I take your rings.
If you win, you break the shard. Simple as that.
[Alear]
Then we can't avoid a fight here.
[Alear]
Stranger with my face, I am ready to battle
when you are.
You will fight me...and this Emblem.
敵マルス 3
敵マルス
...
[Alear]
Marth?!
[Alear]
This is my Emblem...now show me yours.
[Alear]
They'd never believe I'm an Emblem...
And it's best to keep that to myself, so... Marth!
[Veyle]
[Marth]
I'm here!
[Alear]
You have a Marth too?
There should be only one of each ring. This is
more and more interesting.
[Alear]
Everyone, ready yourselves! No matter what,
we must destroy the shard!


--- ED ---




[Alear]
Good. We broke the Fell Dragon Shard. I only
hope the "old me" is going to be OK.
[Veyle]
We were able to provide some healing. The
"old you" will awaken soon.
[Alear]
That's a relief.
[Veyle]
The "old you" saw us in the past though. Do you
think that's...going to cause any problems?
[Alear]
It should be fine. I do forget everything...
eventually.
[Veyle]
Oh, that's right!
[Alear]
It seems we finished just in time.
[Veyle]
I guess this is goodbye to the past. Land around
us is starting to change...
Now we'll really never see Zephia again.
[Alear]
But thanks to her help, we can keep fighting.
And we will.
She sacrificed her life to help us get here. We
have to go on and stop Sombron.
[Veyle]
You're right.
[Veyle]

[Alear]
Goodbye, my old self.
When you begin your journey someday, I hope
your travels are as wonderful as mine.




[Sombron]
You said these invaders were right here.
And yet, they are not.
[Zephia]
That is very odd... Perhaps the battle
moved elsewhere.
[Sombron]
I sensed an unexpected Emblem, and wanted to
see it for myself. But I sense nothing now.
[Zephia]
I'm surprised you came, my lord. It's been some
time since you ventured outside.
[Sombron]
I had to be certain...though I know that Emblem
no longer exists.
[Zephia]
Hm?
[Sombron]
I will go back to the temple. After the battle
concludes, my child will return with news.
[Zephia]
Your children are endlessly impressive. What I
wouldn't do to have such loyal subordinates...
[Sombron]
If you require some of those, then just do what
I do. Make children.
[Zephia]
Make children...of my own?
[Sombron]
Family is function and utility. You put blood in.
You get loyalty out.
My children owe me their lives, their love,
their absolute dedication.
[Zephia]
Family, what a revelation. I would like to
make one of these children...with you.
[Sombron]
You, have a child with me?
[Zephia]
Please, Lord Sombron.
[Sombron]
Now is not the time. But I will consider it after
the war, after my ambitions are served.
[Zephia]
I understand, my lord. I swear to help you
achieve your ambitions.
[Sombron]
I expect your utmost.
[Sombron]
[Zephia]
A child, how intriguing...
What would that be like? To possess fully
through such unconditional love?
How did my mother and father regard me? With
this...love? If only I could travel to the past.
A foolish, impossible thought...
Now, perhaps I should find Lord Sombron's
child. What was that one called?
Oh, why bother? He disposes of them all. One
must never, ever grow attached.
That would just make me sad.


[Alear]
...


[Lumera]
You there! Are you all right?
[Alear]
...
[Lumera]
Oh, thank goodness.
[Alear]
I... I...
[Lumera]
I found you lying here. I was afraid you might
have been dead...
But what a relief, you were just in a
terrible daze.
[Alear]
Was that...a dream?
[Lumera]
A dream?
[Alear]
I met someone who had my face. But who
also looked like you.
Your blue hair and blue eyes are beautiful.
The one with my face had...that too.
[Lumera]
That sounds like a lovely dream. Say, it's chilly
out here. I'd hate for you to catch a cold.
Let's get you somewhere nice and warm.
Do you think you can you stand?
[Alear]
Thank you. This is the first time for this, for me.
You're being...kind.
[Lumera]
Really? I'm...sorry to hear that. What is your
name, child?
[Alear]
Oh, my name... .
Mother told me─this was before she died─that
Father called me that name. Just once.
What is your name?
[Lumera]
I'm Lumera.
[Alear]
I know that name. It's the name of the last
Divine Dragon still alive.
The name of Father's enemy.
[Lumera]
...
[Alear]
If you are the Divine Dragon, then I have to
kill you.
If I don't, Father will call me a defect and
dispose of me. But...
You were kind to me. I don't want to kill you.
[Lumera]
Oh, ...
[Alear]
I am thinking a thought that doesn't belong.
I guess I am what I am. A defect...
Defect. Defect. Defect. Defect. Defect.
[Lumera]
Don't say that! There's nothing defective
about you!
[Alear]
But I must do my duty...or else Father will
dispose of me. He'll feed me to the Corrupted.
That scares me more than anything...
I want to live. To see tomorrow. And the day
after that.
[Lumera]
Then let's keep today between us. I don't want
you to die.
How about this? Let's meet again soon for a
nice, long, kind talk. No one needs to know.
What do you say? Pinky promise?
[Alear]
...
All right.





[Alear]
We made it back.
[Diamant]
To think, we actually met Zephia and you in
the past. It was, I have to admit, chilling.
[Veyle]
The barrier is weaker than before. It worked!
Now, we just need to break the last shard.
[Timerra]
Let's demolish that thing! Where's it at?
[Veyle]
One moment. Let's see...
...
[Alear]
What's wrong? You look worried.
[Veyle]
Oh, it's...nothing.
[Timerra]
Don't tell me. We gotta go to some other
weird place?
[Veyle]
No. It's right here in Gradlon. But...
[Diamant]
Yes?
[Veyle]
Sorry. I'm a little tired. Could I please be alone
for a bit?
[Alear]
We've pushed you so hard, relying on your
power to detect the shards...
Please, take the time you need. We can delay
a little bit longer.
[Veyle]
Thank you.
[Alear]
[Diamant]

[Timerra]

[Veyle]
...
We'll be able to break the last shard. I know
we will.
How can I tell them who's there guarding it?
Or why I'm able to sense...what's there.


--- EV ---

" [Alear]
I make avalanches happen. Even when they
don't want to happen. I just do this.


[Alear]
We've been pushed back!
" [Alear]
That works. I'll keep doing what works.


[Alear]
We have to reach the shard, but at this rate,
we'll get nowhere fast!
If an avalanche starts near you, take shelter!
Stay safe until you can proceed!

--- BT ---

[Alear]
You made it this far? You're strong. You should
be on my side.

$ [Alear]
I sense that you are looking and staring. You
will not win that way. Or are you scared?

[Alear]
Yes, of course. I've been scared from the start
of all this. It's only natural.
Scared of losing battles, of losing what's
important to me, losing people I care about!
[Alear]
I will admit...I am jealous of you.
You have my face, but you say the things you
feel...out loud.
I am not allowed to show fear.

If I say I am afraid, I will be labeled a defect.
" I follow orders. I don't think. I am like the
Corrupted. They are awful.

[Alear]
You really dislike the Corrupted too!
[Alear]
I hate them. They have killed many of my
sisters and my brothers.
$ [Alear] Serious
If I lose to you, they will kill me. No... No, they
will kill me, in time, no matter what.
[Alear]
...
[Alear]
Relax
But...you don't die. I'm proof of that.
$ [Alear]
What did you say? Never mind─let's finish.
Come at me, or I will come at you.
This is like looking in a mirror. What I see...
bothers me.

 [Alear]
Veyle? Is that you?

[Veyle]
What?!
$ [Alear]
No... Veyle is younger than you are.
Forget what I said.

[Veyle]
Are you...related to Veyle?
" [Alear]
She is my youngest sibling and littlest sister.
I had many sisters and many brothers. Most of
them have been killed. In awful ways.
$ [Alear] Serious
Will Father dispose of Veyle too? If I think
about that, it makes me sad.
I would like to stand by my sister. Always.
An ally. A friend.
[Veyle]
She's that important to you.
" [Alear]
You look too much like her. It bothers me.
I'll defeat you now. Whoever you are, you
are not my little sister.

[Veyle]
You're right. I'm not your little sister. Still, I'm
glad I was here with you to...hear all of that.
Thank you, Brother.
Thank you, Sister.

$ [Alear] Serious
[Alear]
Oh no... Now Father will...dispose of me.
