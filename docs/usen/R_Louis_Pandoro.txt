[Pandreo] 
Louis! Are you peeping again?
[Louis] 
Pardon me, Pandreo, but I would never do 
anything so gauche as "peeping."
[Louis] 
I prefer to think of it as "observing from afar."
[Pandreo] 
Hahaha! Oh, well, excuse me. That's nothing at 
all like peeping.
[Pandreo] 
Whatever, bud. If you get bored of...not peeping, 
you're welcome to party hardy with me.
[Louis] 
Party...hardy?
[Pandreo] 
Yup!
[Pandreo] 
You and me can let our hair down and do some 
good old-fashioned male bonding!
[Louis] 
Hmm. Male bonding...
[Louis] 
I've wondered lately if that may be something 
worth observing firsthand.
[Pandreo] 
Well, what do you know! Serendipity.
[Louis] 
Quite so.
[Louis] 
Pandreo, I would be exceptionally pleased to 
accept your invitation.
[Louis] 
Let the two of us explore all the ways in which 
two men may grow ever closer.
[Pandreo] 
How is it you make everything sound 
suggestive?
[Pandreo] 
Anyway, I'm glad you're on board. Though you 
should know I take my partying seriously.
[Pandreo] 
We're gonna shimmy and swing till dawn, so 
you can forget about sleeping!
[Louis] 
I shall match you measure for measure, 
Pandreo!

[Pandreo] 
Ow, ow... Ooo, that smarts...
[Louis] 
Haha... We may have "partied hardy" a bit too 
much last night, wouldn't you say?
[Pandreo] 
Yeah. I tell ya, after so much carousing, I have a 
headache. And an everything-else-ache.
[Louis] 
For all that, though, I enjoyed myself.
[Louis] 
It's nice to "go out with the guys" every so 
often, isn't it?
[Pandreo] 
I'm glad to hear you say so. That makes this 
full-body migraine worthwhile.
[Louis] 
I find that hard partying does give one an 
appetite. Do you like grapes, Pandreo?
[Pandreo] 
Sure, I like them all right.
[Louis] 
In that case, I'll fetch some pastries. The filling 
was made with grapes from my hometown.
[Pandreo] 
Ooh, so it's a local delicacy, huh? Sure, give me 
all you've got!
[Louis] 
All I've got?! If you like, but I feel I ought to 
caution you against overindulging.
[Pandreo] 
Well, I'm not going to eat it all by myself.
[Pandreo] 
I'm thinking it might be nice to put some treats 
out for my flock.
[Louis] 
Oh? You keep animals?
[Pandreo] 
My congregation. They like having a casual 
environment to pray and hang out, you know?
[Pandreo] 
I'm sure a platter of tasty pastries will bring 
even more people in the door.
[Pandreo] 
Plus, one of my congregants is a merchant. 
He might want to import those grapes of yours.
[Louis] 
Ah! Very considerate of you.
[Louis] 
Always thinking of ways to assist your flock, 
aren't you?
[Pandreo] 
Hahaha! That's my whole job!
[Pandreo] 
I might not always look or act like it, but I am 
a man of the cloth.
[Louis] 
Hahaha! My doubts have been thoroughly 
laid to rest.
[Pandreo] 
With all that said, I can't quit partying! You'll 
come with again, right, Louis?
[Louis] 
Naturally! I am at your command, Pandreo.

[Louis] 
Ahem...
[Pandreo] 
Oh! Sorry, Louis. I didn't see you there.
[Pandreo] 
I get very focused when I'm praying.
[Louis] 
Never fear. I had hoped not to disturb you.
[Pandreo] 
Did you have a question?
[Pandreo] 
I've already told you all the good "observing" 
spots I could think of.
[Louis] 
No...there is something else on my mind today.
[Louis] 
I thought I might ask you to say a prayer... 
for my mother.
[Pandreo] 
Hm. Forgive me if I'm misremembering, but...
[Pandreo] 
I thought your mother passed away.
[Louis] 
You recall correctly.
[Louis] 
I was very young then and too devastated to 
do anything but take each day as it came.
[Louis] 
Though it embarrasses me to admit that it's 
taken so long to realize this...
[Louis] 
I don't believe I ever gave my mother a proper 
send-off amidst all the tumult.
[Pandreo] 
I see.
[Louis] 
My family were never very deeply religious, 
you see. No offense intended.
[Pandreo] 
Oh, none taken. Religious or not, you wish her a 
peaceful rest. I respect that.
[Pandreo] 
I'm sure she will be glad to hear that from her 
place in the heavens.
[Louis] 
Thank you, Pandreo.
[Pandreo] 
Are you sure I'm the right messenger, though?
[Pandreo] 
A man of the cloth I may be, but I'm not what 
most would call conventional.
[Pandreo] 
You don't think someone else might be 
more suitable?
[Louis] 
No. My choice is deliberate.
[Louis] 
If someone is going to give her a memorial 
service, I would prefer it to be a dear friend.
[Pandreo] 
Gotcha. Well then, I'm happy to help, Louis.
[Pandreo] 
Let's pray, shall we? Our guiding soul, who 
art above...
[Louis] 
...
[Louis] 
Mother... May your soul find peace.
