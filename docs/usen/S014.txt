=== Paralogue The Hero-King ===

(The Broken Castle)
A place of significance to Emblem
Marth. Here, the Divine Dragon will
face an important trial.

--- OP ---



[Marth]
Odd. This looks very similar to Altea Castle.
[Alear]
Altea Castle. Is that a place in your world?
[Marth]
That's right. It's where I grew up. After it fell
into enemy hands, my allies and I took it back.
[Alear]
You lost your home?
[Marth]
The Dolhr Empire, led by the Shadow Dragon
Medeus, attacked. His forces overran the castle.
[Marth]
The castle knights offered protection, and many
soldiers fell while aiding my escape.
[Marth]
On that day, I learned the true meaning
of powerlessness.
[Marth]
Allies, like Princess Caeda and the mercenary
Ogma, helped me retake my homeland.
[Marth]
My people call me the Hero-King, but I think the
real heroes are those who helped me to win.
[Marth]
That's why I fight─for all those who believed
in me. I want to deliver on their hope.
[Alear]
I...think I know what you mean.
[Alear]
I want a future of peace with my friends and
allies. That vision pushes me to be my best.
[Marth]
You have grown strong in your battles and are
more than worthy of their faith in you.
[Marth]
Now they stand beside you, ready to share your
burden. Your struggles are not yours alone.
[Alear]
My friends and family have brought me all this
way. I owe them so much.
[Marth]
Keep those feelings close to your heart, and you
are certain to overcome this trial.
[Alear]
Trial?
[Marth]
Battle me now, . This is the trial
bestowed upon you.
[Marth]
Best me in combat to strengthen our bond.
Win, and you will draw more power from me.
[Alear]
Let the battle begin. I'll show you I can
overcome this or any trial!

[Marth]
Excellent. I could sense the power of your hope
and your strength as warriors.
[Marth]
As I fought, I was reminded of an old friend.
[Marth]
I first met the Divine Dragon Tiki in the midst
of battle. Much like this.
[Alear]
It's incredible that your world has a Divine
Dragon in it too.
[Marth]
Yes. Like you, she fought for us humans.
[Marth]
Tiki was placed into a very long sleep in a
temple where she would be kept safe.
[Marth]
She woke and was incredibly lonely. Once we
met, she said she wanted to stay with us.
[Marth]
She called me "Mar-Mar," like a kid sister might.
Human or dragon, we became friends for life.
[Alear]
Then she and I have something in common
besides our species─you.
[Alear]
Marth, who fights to end people's suffering.
Like her, I'm happy to be close to such a hero.
[Marth]
Since our first meeting, I have felt the same.
[Alear]
I'm grateful to you. I've become stronger
because you are with me.
[Alear]
Having my friends by my side is what makes
everything possible. I couldn't do this alone.
[Marth]
Then you understand. We will follow you
always.

[Marth]
I'd hate to embarrass myself fighting you, so
don't expect this to be easy.

[Marth]
I have been waiting for you. Do you believe
you can best me?

[Marth]
Much has come to pass─meetings, farewells,
and reunions alike. How are you faring?

[Alear]
I could never put those feelings into words.
So...I'll answer you with my weapon.
[Marth]
I would ask for nothing less!

[Alear]
Here I come!


[Veyle]
Marth? Do I really have to fight you? I...I don't
want to hurt any of my friends.
[Marth]
I am of no consequence to you. This battle is
about conquering oneself.

[Veyle]
Conquering oneself... Ah, I understand. I must
conquer the Veyle I used to be!
[Marth]
Now, raise your chin. You are not alone
anymore. Remember that, and triumph!
