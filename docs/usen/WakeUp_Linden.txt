Softly now...
But how soft must I be, exactly?


Will running water do it? No, it would seem not.
Knocking on wood? How about burning wood? 
Still nothing?
The flames appear to be spreading.
Oh my!


Good morning, Divine One...
No, we are not under attack.
Begging your pardon...I will sort this out 
with wind magic right away.


Ah!
You noticed my quietest footsteps!
Your hearing is excellent, Divine One.
Might I have a look at your ears?


--- C2 ---

Too early to experiment, they say? Ridiculous!
Oh, look at this place!


A place to resume. Now then...
Vinegar, candlewax, a bit of Fire...
Ah! Too much fire!
Abort the experiment! Put it out! Put it out!


Terribly sorry...
Is this your bedchamber?
I'm afraid I didn't realize.
Please forgive me.


Divine One!
I was merely passing by.
Surely not intending any experiments.
I'll be on my way.


--- B1 ---

Look, Divine One!
I've managed to create my own Emblem Ring!


It seems I've failed to capture your interest. 
I was sure this would work.
Well, if this ring doesn't interest you, I'll have 
to eat it.
Down the hatch, as I believe they say...


Mmm...mmm...mmm...
Hahaha! Surprised, are you?
It was only a bit of candy.
But when they're shaped like rings, you can 
wear your sweets until you're hungry!
Want to try one?


That got your attention!
Alas, in my excitement, I seem to have 
crushed it.
At least it'll taste good.
It was made of candy, you see.


--- B2 ---

Divine One...I came to say thank you.
For indulging me.


I enjoyed our conversation.
Your intelligence and spirit of curiosity are 
greatly appreciated.
Oh, I almost forgot! I wanted to show you this 
bottle of─ Oh no.


Now I've done it!
This stuff is quite volatile!
Were you singed at all?
Vander would be most upset with me if you 
had been.


Did I wake you prematurely? Apologies.
Oh? So you woke quickly in order to spend 
your time more efficiently?
Haha! That's the Divine Dragon I've come 
to know!


--- A1 ---

I have devised yet another ingenious innovation.


I've used Thunder to add pep...
to this drink.
The bubbles have since died down...
but refreshing them is simple enough. Thunder!
Oh no! Too much!


Are you awake, Divine One?
I was going to offer you a drink...
but that last burst of Thunder zapped it all 
to foam.
Would you like some foam?


Good morning.
Care for some unique fruit to start your day?
Notice the crackling texture...
which I created with thunder magic.


--- A2 ---

I can't help but feel a twinge of guilt for coming 
in to wake you, Divine One.


Such a tranquil sleeper you are.
This feels like a crime.
Even if it's dereliction of duty, I cannot bring 
myself to disturb such peaceful slumber!


It seems I've woken you by mistake.
I'm terribly sorry. I know that young ones need 
their rest.
Oh, that's right...
I forgot you're over a thousand years old!


Aha. You're already awake.
Good morning, then.


--- S1 ---

It's morning! Time for you to start getting ready.


Waking up remains a struggle for you, I see.
Coming in to wake you like this reminds me...
of how I once did the same for my family many 
years ago.
But my children no longer need me.
So allow me to devote myself to you instead.
Until this war is over, or until I finally return to 
my dear departed wife...
I will look after you.


You're awake.
Let's get you ready.
Hm? Of course I don't mind.
You chose this old fellow as your partner, 
after all.
I am here for you.


Look at you. Clothes wrinkled, hair a mess...
Hehe, sorry. Got carried away.
It is all too easy for me to fuss over you...
as if you were my child.


--- S2 ---

Hehe, still sound asleep? Then I suppose I'll 
take the time to conduct a little experiment...


By alternating Thunder and Fire on this metal...
it should take shape quickly!
Lo and behold─a perfectly serviceable bracelet.
Too flawed to compare to the Pact Ring...
but a fine gift nevertheless.
Something for you to remember me by...
when I'm long gone.


Good morning.
I am ready to help you with whatever you need, 
Divine One.
You should know I will always be grateful...
that you require my strength.


Haha, got you.
It seems I know just what to say to get you up.
I believe I'm starting to appreciate...
the nature of our partnership.
