[Alear] 
Thank you for sparring with me, Saphir.
[Saphir] 
No problem. Always a pleasure to find an 
opponent who can help me work up a sweat.
[Alear] 
Glad to hear it, since I barely kept up. I see now 
why Brodia holds you in such high regard.
[Saphir] 
Don't be too modest. You're good, and you've 
got lots of room to grow.
[Saphir] 
Strength, skill, speed... You're full of potential. 
Keep training─you'll see.
[Alear] 
Maybe, but what I really envy is your intensity. 
The way you press the attack...it's relentless.
[Alear] 
Do you think I've got the potential to be as 
ferocious a fighter as you are?
[Saphir] 
That's...
[Alear] 
Saphir?
[Saphir] 
Ah, sorry.
[Saphir] 
Listen... You'd be better off not modeling your 
fighting style too much after mine.
[Saphir] 
Ferocity doesn't suit you. You're too kind 
a person for it.
[Saphir] 
Just be yourself, and hang on tight to that 
kindness. Don't let it go.
[Alear] 
I understand, Saphir. Thank you.

[Saphir] 
OK, that's enough sparring for today.
[Alear] 
Thanks again for indulging me.
[Saphir] 
There really is such kindness in your eyes, even 
when you're fighting. It's refreshing.
[Saphir] 
Anyway, thanks for the warm-up. I'm off to do 
some strength training.
[Alear] 
One training session straight to another? 
Your stamina's amazing.
[Saphir] 
When training is all you have, you give it all 
you've got.
[Alear] 
What do you mean, "training is all you have"?
[Saphir] 
...
[Saphir] 
Yeah, OK. I don't usually talk about this, but 
you deserve an answer.
[Saphir] 
I've always been strong, even as a kid. But back 
in those days, I had a friend I could never beat.
[Saphir] 
This friend trained hard─and I mean hard─with 
the goal of becoming the strongest knight ever.
[Saphir] 
One day, Elusia attacked my village. My friend 
was killed.
[Saphir] 
After that, I figured someone should honor her 
wish to be the strongest. Might as well be me.
[Alear] 
I'm so sorry for your loss.
[Alear] 
I can't help but feel that isn't the only reason 
you train so hard, though.
[Saphir] 
What makes you say that?
[Alear] 
That ferocity when you fight...it doesn't feel 
like grief to me. It feels more like vengeance.
[Saphir] 
...
[Saphir] 
I really should get back to training. Muscles'll 
tighten up if I stand around too long.
[Saphir] 
Thanks for letting me talk your ear off, though. 
I'll see you later.
[Alear] 
Saphir...
[Alear] 
I went too far. I should apologize...

[Saphir] 
Divine One... I'm sorry for how I reacted 
to what you said about the way I fight.
[Alear] 
Please, don't apologize. It was insensitive 
of me to pry.
[Saphir] 
You weren't wrong. I'm still holding on to 
hatred of Elusia.
[Saphir] 
But being the only one who lived...somehow 
that's even more unforgivable.
[Saphir] 
If my friend had survived the attack instead of 
me, Brodia's knights would be stronger for it.
[Saphir] 
I think that's why I go all out in every battle. 
Trying to make up for the loss.
[Alear] 
Thank you for confiding in me.
[Alear] 
Hearing it actually makes me feel a lot better.
[Saphir] 
How do you mean?
[Alear] 
If you trained so hard purely for revenge, 
I'd have to try to talk you out of it.
[Alear] 
Even if it leads to strength, that path is too full 
of grief to follow.
[Alear] 
But now I see that you push yourself to fulfill 
the wish of someone you care about.
[Alear] 
I'm sure your friend appreciates it, but I still 
don't think it's worth the pain you're carrying.
[Alear] 
If I were her...I'd just want you to be happy.
[Saphir] 
You know...I never even considered that.
[Saphir] 
Maybe you're right. We are talking about 
one of the kindest people I've ever met.
[Saphir] 
But how can you be so sure what she'd think 
in this situation, Divine One?
[Alear] 
It's easy to know that sort of thing when you 
care about a person.
[Saphir] 
Ah...
[Alear] 
Was that the wrong answer?
[Saphir] 
No, of course not. It's...nice to hear.
[Saphir] 
Thank you, Divine One. It means a lot to me.

[Alear] 
Hyah!
[Saphir] 
Hah, nice one. I yield.
[Alear] 
Thanks for the match.
[Alear] 
That's enough training for today, though. 
Phew, you really wore me out.
[Saphir] 
You gave it your all today, Divine One. That was 
some intense stuff.
[Saphir] 
I know I said you had potential, but even I didn't 
expect you to develop so quickly.
[Alear] 
If I have, it's thanks to you─and not just 
your encouragement.
[Alear] 
I want to be strong enough to protect you.
[Saphir] 
Protect me?
[Alear] 
Haha, I'm not sure I've ever seen you 
blush before.
[Saphir] 
No one's ever said anything like that to me 
before. I have no idea how to respond.
[Alear] 
However ferocious you might be, you still 
have a tender heart.
[Alear] 
I love that about you.
[Alear] 
That's why I want you to have the Pact Ring.
[Saphir] 
Uh...
[Alear] 
You're the person I care for most. This ring 
is a symbol of how precious you are to me.
[Alear] 
So, what do you say? Sparring partners forever?
[Saphir] 
I...
[Saphir] 
Can I really let myself be so...happy?
[Alear] 
I know it might seem impossible. You've been 
through so much pain and struggle.
[Alear] 
But that's exactly why you deserve to have 
some happiness.
[Saphir] 
You're right, . Thank you.
[Saphir] 
I'll take this ring and your offer happily.
[Alear] 
Good, because I'm going to be there for you 
from now until the end.
[Saphir] 
That goes both ways. I'll fight with all I have 
to protect you...and to make you happy.
