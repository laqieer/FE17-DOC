=== Alear & Alfred ===

[Alfred]
Morning, Divine One!
[Alear]
Good morning, Alfred.
[Alear]
That's...quite the smile. Having a good day,
are you?
[Alfred]
You can say that again!
[Alfred]
I got up before sunrise and did tons of training.
Even got an early run in.
[Alfred]
And the cherry on top? I get to see your bright
and shining face. What a day to be alive!
[Alear]
There's no need to tease me.
[Alfred]
Who's teasing? Wouldn't you be just as happy
to wake up to the sight of a friend?
[Alear]
Well, yes. I do feel happy when I see my friends.
[Alfred]
See? Me too!
[Alfred]
But look, isn't there anything I can do for you?
You've been awake a while, but it must be hard.
[Alfred]
There's bound to be a lot you're still adjusting
to. Tell your friend Alfred all about it!
[Alear]
Let me think... Hmm. No, there's nothing
bothering me at the moment.
[Alfred]
Good. Great. But if there is something, well,
I want to be the first to know.
[Alfred]
Before you left Lythos, you asked me as a
friend to teach you things─to help you adjust.
[Alfred]
And knowing you wanted to be friends just
tickled me.
[Alear]
Our friendship makes me happy too, Alfred.

[Alear]
Hi, Alfred. Do you have a moment?
[Alfred]
Sure do! Whatever you need─I'm all ears.
[Alear]
I appreciate the beautiful breakfasts you've
been bringing me in the mornings.
[Alear]
But would you please stop making them?
[Alfred]
Oh no! They've been too heavy on the meat,
haven't they? I just wanted you to get strong.
[Alear]
To be honest, they do have a ton of meat...
But that's not why I'm bringing it up.
[Alear]
I just feel bad that you've gone out of your way
to do this for me every morning.
[Alfred]
Ah, I get you. Sorry about that. I wasn't out to
make you feel bad.
[Alfred]
I thought my friend would enjoy waking up to
healthy, yummy breakfasts. But I'll cut it out.
[Alear]
Thank you, Alfred. There was one other thing.
[Alear]
Every night, as I'm fading into sleep, I hear the
haunting song of a flute...
[Alfred]
Yeah! That's me playing a lullaby. Just making
sure the Divine One gets a good night's rest.
[Alear]
Ah, I thought that was your silhouette outside
my sanctum.
[Alear]
Your playing is quite lovely, but I'd like for you
to stop doing that as well. Please.
[Alear]
The song continued into the late hours, and
it started invading my dreams...
[Alfred]
Oh no... I am so sorry! I had a hard time telling
when you were asleep, so I just kept going.
[Alfred]
I was only trying to help, but... Wow. This really
didn't pan out.
[Alfred]
Maybe I'm not worthy of being your friend.
[Alear]
That's rather extreme.
[Alfred]
I always try to keep things light, but I feel awful
right now. I need a jog to clear my head.
[Alfred]
Sorry for the trouble, Divine One. I'm off for
my run. Goodbye!
[Alear]
Wait! Alfred...

[Alear]
Ah, there you are, Alfred.
[Alear]
Do you recall when you said you weren't
"worthy" of my friendship?
[Alfred]
Yeah. I didn't think hard enough about your
feelings, and I made a pest of myself.
[Alear]
Well, I disagree with what you said. You're my
friend, Alfred.
[Alear]
We ended up here because you were trying so
hard to help me, which I do appreciate.
[Alear]
So, please, don't ever say things like that again.
[Alfred]
Sorry, Divine One...
[Alfred]
Everything I did was way off the mark. How
could I possibly still call myself your friend?
[Alear]
You already do so much for me, Alfred. Doing
additional things isn't necessary.
[Alear]
You know...you were the first friend I made
after I awoke.
[Alear]
It would pain me if my first friend didn't spend
time around me anymore.
[Alfred]
Your first friend, huh?
[Alfred]
That's got a real ring to it! Thank you.
I'd be honored.
[Alfred]
I did feel close to you, y'know, even before
you woke up.
[Alfred]
So when you finally did wake up, I was so
excited that I went completely overboard.
[Alfred]
But I'm through with all that. From now on, let's
be plain ol' friends!
[Alear]
I'd like that very much.
[Alfred]
Good. Oh! I have a great idea.
[Alfred]
As my totally regular friend, what do you say
we do laps around the atrium together?
[Alear]
Laps? As in, running? Right now?
[Alfred]
No time like the present! Off we go!
[Alear]
Now wait just a moment! I haven't even agreed!
[Alear]
Alfred! Alfreeeeed!

[Alfred]
Good morning, Divine One.
[Alear]
Good morning, Alfred. Is something troubling
you? You look a little upset.
[Alfred]
You could tell, huh? I'm dealing with a lot of
emotions right now.
[Alfred]
You know me─I act, then maybe I think. Not the
other way around.
[Alear]
Yes, I've noticed that in you. Once you have an
idea, you run with it.
[Alfred]
But for the first time in maybe ever, I'm
dragging my heels getting something done.
[Alfred]
This time, if I act without thinking, I might end
up destroying a perfectly good friendship.
[Alfred]
Plus, I'd be going back on my word.
[Alear]
What do you mean?
[Alfred]
Remember when I said I wanted us to be plain
ol' friends?
[Alear]
Don't tell me you're back to feeling unworthy
of my friendship again.
[Alfred]
...
[Alfred]
I'm the crown prince of Firene. I can't be a
coward when it comes to this of all things.
[Alfred]
Plain ol' friends isn't going to cut it with me
anymore, sorry to say.
[Alfred]
Divine One? I want us to be closer than that.
[Alear]
...
[Alfred]
I said I'd stop going overboard when it comes
to you, but I can't help myself.
[Alfred]
I even brought you this. See what I mean?
[Alear]
The embroidery on this is exquisite.
[Alfred]
It's an old Firenese tradition to pass down
embroidered clothes through the generations.
[Alfred]
This royal piece has been re-sewn so many
times, it's taken on a completely new form.
[Alfred]
Still, I have it, and I'm supposed to give it to
someone important to me to show I care.
[Alear]
Wow...
[Alear]
Thank you so much. I will happily accept
your gesture.
[Alfred]
Oh! Gosh. You're sure? It's not too much?
[Alear]
No, it's perfect. I feel the same way about you.
[Alear]
Thinking back, I've felt that way almost as soon
as we met in Lythos Castle.
[Alear]
Now I have something for you. Please, may I
see your hand, Alfred?
[Alfred]
The Pact Ring?
[Alear]
We're going to be inseparable. I look forward
to the journey ahead with you.
[Alfred]
Thank you, ...
[Alfred]
I'm done holding back my feelings. I love you.
You've made me the happiest man in the world.
