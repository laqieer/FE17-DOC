=== Clanne & Hortensia ===

[Hortensia]
Ah, there you are, Clanne!
[Clanne]
Huh? I mean, hello...Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia]
That's right! It's the princess of the mighty
kingdom of Elusia.
[Hortensia]
Hortensia! Whoo! Hoo-hoo! Yeah!
[Clanne]
Yes... Did you need something? From me,
I mean?
[Hortensia]
It so happens, a little birdie told me...
[Hortensia]
You, my Clanne-shell, are the president of my
fan club!
[Clanne]
What?
[Hortensia]
What do you mean "what?"
[Hortensia]
And shouldn't you be...I don't know, swooning?
Your idol is right here, talking to you!
[Clanne]
Um, Princess Hortensia, I think you might have
gotten a bit confused...
[Hortensia]
Confused? Confused how?
[Clanne]
Well...the fan club I'm the president of is...

[Hortensia]
What?!
[Hortensia]
You're the president of a fan club for your
own liege?
[Clanne]
I'm so sorry for the...misunderstanding.
[Hortensia]
Ugh. Embarrassing...
[Hortensia]
Wait! Clanne! The princess of Elusia has orders
for you!
[Clanne]
Wha?
[Hortensia]
I want you...to form me a fan club!
[Clanne]
I don't work for you!

[Clanne]
Princess Hortensia, can I ask why you want to
have a fan club?
[Hortensia]
Why? Simple.
[Hortensia]
I already told everyone I have one.
[Hortensia]
That means if I don't get one soon, it'll be like
I lied to them. And I'm not a liar!
[Clanne]
I see...
[Hortensia]
That's why I need your help. Or are you saying
you don't want to help me?
[Clanne]
It's not that I don't want to...
[Clanne]
But fan clubs are based around someone you
really admire.
[Hortensia]
So...admire me, then. What's the problem?
[Clanne]
Uh, um...
[Clanne]
It's hard to cheer on someone who...doesn't...
you know...earn it?
[Hortensia]
Hey, hey, hey! Are you saying I don't deserve
your praise and devotion?!
[Clanne]
Sorry...
[Hortensia]
Ah... Fine. That's fair. I'll drop it.
[Hortensia]
Bullying you into starting a fan club would be
sad and desperate. Sorry to waste your time.
[Clanne]
N-no problem.
[Hortensia]
I gotta say, Clanne, I like that you're honest. It's
actually kinda refreshing to be told "no."
[Clanne]
...
[Hortensia]
All right, I'm heading back. I've got some lies to
apologize for.
[Clanne]
How...admirable.

[Hortensia]
Clanne? What are you doing?
[Clanne]
Princess Hortensia?!
[Hortensia]
Sorry to startle you! If you're nervous because
of earlier, I'm not mad or anything.
[Hortensia]
I told everyone that I made up the fan club.
They said they'd assumed that, so...
[Hortensia]
I guess they already thought I lied. Rude.
[Clanne]
A-about that... I wanted you to see something,
Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia]
Hm? A slip of paper? And some writing...
[Hortensia]
"Princess Hortensia Appreciation Society.
Club President... Clanne"?
[Hortensia]
This is...a membership card. You made this?
[Clanne]
When we talked before, you were...abrasive but
also kind. And you owned up to your mistakes.
[Clanne]
And...I thought that was neat. So I made a
fan club.
[Hortensia]
Aww, Clanne...
[Clanne]
Maybe it's too late, but I'll be cheering you on,
Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia]
Ugh...late, yeah. But even so...
[Hortensia]
Aaah, this makes me SO happy! Thank you,
Clanne!
[Clanne]
Now let's get out and promote the fan club!
I'm sure lots of people will want to join!
[Hortensia]
Actually... You know what? I think I'd like to
have a fan club of one for a while.
[Clanne]
Really? Why?
[Hortensia]
Well, obviously if it's a club about me, a ton of
fans from all over will join eventually.
[Hortensia]
So it might be nice to have a smaller cheering
section while I still can, you know?
[Clanne]
Aw...that does sound nice.
[Clanne]
All right, I'll just have to be the best one-person
cheering section I can be!
[Hortensia]
Can't ask for more from a fan-club president.
