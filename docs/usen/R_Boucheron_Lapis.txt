[Lapis] 
You're...Boucheron, right? I'm Lapis. I'll be on 
serving duty starting today.
[Boucheron] 
That's right, I'm Boucheron. I'll be serving with 
you, looks like. Nice to meet you.
[Boucheron] 
Let's get this done quick. I think everyone's 
pretty hungry.
[Boucheron] 
Here we go. That should be enough milk.
[Lapis] 
Enough?
[Lapis] 
That's way too much.
[Boucheron] 
You think so? It seems about right to me.
[Lapis] 
Then you need to get your eyes checked.
[Lapis] 
That's enough milk to last 10 days.
[Boucheron] 
What are you talking about? It won't last the 
length of this meal.
[Lapis] 
What are you talking about? Look. Pour one 
part milk into the cup...
[Lapis] 
Then add ten parts water.
[Boucheron] 
Hold on a second! Why would you add water? 
And why so much?
[Lapis] 
You don't dilute your milk? I always heard it 
was unhealthy to drink straight.
[Boucheron] 
That's the first I've heard of it.
[Lapis] 
Uh...
[Lapis] 
You're not messing with me, right? You're 
being serious?
[Boucheron] 
Completely serious.
[Lapis] 
Oh...
[Lapis] 
In that case...forget I said anything. I must have 
been confused.
[Boucheron] 
I'm a little confused myself...

[Lapis] 
Looks like it's the two of us on serving duty 
again today.
[Boucheron] 
Looks like it.
[Boucheron] 
Ooo! We get steak today!
[Lapis] 
Mmm! It looks so delicious!
[Lapis] 
Gather around, everyone! Bring your rice and 
line up.
[Boucheron] 
Wait, why are you calling everyone? We serve 
people one at a time.
[Lapis] 
Huh? But we have to fill up on the smell first.
[Boucheron] 
Fill up on what? What are you talking about?
[Lapis] 
The steak's smell, of course.
[Lapis] 
You've got to eat your rice while you can smell 
the steak grilling. That's how you get full.
[Boucheron] 
Huh?
[Lapis] 
Come on, Boucheron. You're a grown-up. 
You should know all this by now.
[Boucheron] 
Is this some Brodian custom?
[Lapis] 
No? This is how people eat all over the world.
[Boucheron] 
Says who?
[Lapis] 
My family back home. And everyone else in 
the village, for that matter.
[Boucheron] 
...
[Boucheron] 
Lapis, I don't think anyone else does that. 
Not anywhere in the world.
[Lapis] 
Haha, nuh-uh! You're not fooling me again.
[Boucheron] 
No, I'm not joking. I mean it.
[Lapis] 
Um, really?
[Lapis] 
You're not just teasing me? Because that...that 
would be really rude.
[Boucheron] 
Once again, I'm completely serious.
[Lapis] 
Uh...
[Lapis] 
You're right! Ha, silly me. I guess I got a little 
mixed up again.
[Boucheron] 
Hmm. Whereas for me, certain things are 
becoming clearer...

[Boucheron] 
Time for my afternoon tea.
[Lapis] 
Hey, Boucheron. I made a ton of snacks. Here. 
I bet it'll go great with your tea.
[Boucheron] 
Well, that was nice of you. Hang on, though. 
What is that?
[Lapis] 
A snack.
[Boucheron] 
This is your snack? A weed?
[Lapis] 
Yeah!
[Lapis] 
I pulled weeds earlier and then cooked them up 
to give as treats. Doesn't everyone do that?
[Boucheron] 
...
[Lapis] 
Oh, come on. This isn't a universal thing either?
[Boucheron] 
Afraid not.
[Lapis] 
Ugh...
[Boucheron] 
Lapis, be honest with me. Are you from a 
poor village?
[Lapis] 
...
[Lapis] 
Wh-what makes you say that?!
[Boucheron] 
It was getting increasingly obvious.
[Lapis] 
Oh no, no, no, no! That's no good! I don't want 
anyone to know. Especially not...him.
[Boucheron] 
"Him"?
[Lapis] 
Gah! Forget I said anything! Please, just don't 
tell anyone about this!
[Boucheron] 
It's OK, Lapis. I'm not making fun of you or 
anyone else who came from poverty.
[Boucheron] 
If anything, I'm inspired by the creativity it 
instilled in you.
[Lapis] 
Now you're just lying to make me feel better.
[Boucheron] 
No, really. I've tried the watered-down milk 
and the "fill up on smells" trick for myself.
[Lapis] 
Huh?
[Lapis] 
And...what did you think?
[Boucheron] 
They weren't bad. I feel like I got a window into 
a whole different world.
[Lapis] 
Really?!
[Boucheron] 
Really! So I'd love to try your snacks.
[Boucheron] 
Wow, this flavor is unbelievable!
[Boucheron] 
My life is now divided into the time before I'd 
tried this and the glorious time after.
[Lapis] 
You know what, Boucheron?
[Lapis] 
You're a good guy. I mean that.
[Boucheron] 
Aww, you're too kind. I'm just a guy who's all 
brawn and no brains.
[Lapis] 
If you're really interested, I could teach you 
some more customs from my village.
[Boucheron] 
I'd love that.
[Boucheron] 
Hang on, though. Before that, we have to share 
your snack with the others.
[Boucheron] 
Hey, everyone! We've got a special treat today! 
Line up for snack time.
[Lapis] 
Haha!
[Lapis] 
Thanks, Boucheron. That means a lot to me.
