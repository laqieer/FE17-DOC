=== Chapter 5 Retaking the Castle ===

(Firene Castle)
Upon learning that Elusia invaded
Firene Castle, the Divine Dragon's
army hastens to Queen Ève.

--- OP ---



[Alfred]
There's the castle.
[Céline]
It's so quiet... Where are our knights? Or the
Elusian soldiers, for that matter?
[Alfred]
You said they were marching toward the castle
when you left.
They've probably made their way inside.
[Céline]
But then...what of the townsfolk? What
of Mother?!
[Alear]
Let's hurry.

[Ève]
...
Irc [Boss]
Hate to break it to ya, Queenie, but our forces have taken
the castle. This is the part where you tell me where
you've got the ring stashed in here.
[Ève]
Who's to say?
Irc [Boss]
Is it inside the castle? Out on the grounds?
I'm asking all polite-like─c'mon!
[Ève]
I'm not in the habit of speaking to lowly vermin.
That's all that you are─the lot of you.
Irc [Boss]
The mouth on this one. You think I won't gut
ya where you stand?!
[Zephia]
I'd recommend against it, darling.
Irc [Boss]
Lady Zephia!
[Zephia]
After all, Her Majesty can't tell us much of value
if she's dead. Now, I come bearing news.
One of our soldiers says he spotted the princess
fleeing before we arrived. How curious.
Did you perhaps give that daughter of yours
the ring for safekeeping?
[Ève]
...
[Zephia]
Aw, well, isn't this tragic. We'd simply hate to resort
to violence.
You leave us no choice. By virtue of your silence, we will
now kill every living soul in this castle, one by one.
[Ève]
Please, no!


[Alfred]
Mother!
[Céline]
Mother, we're here!
[Alfred]

[Céline]


[Ève]
Alfred! Céline!
[Zephia]
Oh, look. The kids are home.
[Ève]
[Zephia]

[Alfred]
You Elusian scum! Get away from her!
[Alfred]

[Céline]


[Zephia]
Hm-hm. Who's going to make us?
I'm glad you've come. Now we can see for
ourselves if the princess has the ring.
[Ève]
No! Please, leave my children alone!
[Zephia]
Of course. As long as you tell me where the
ring is.
[Ève]
I...
[Zephia]
Ah. Young Céline does have it, doesn't she?
We'll have to kill her, then. The prince, too, for
good measure.
Take Her Majesty away. We'll continue our
conversation later, if need be.
[Ève]
Unhand me!

[Alfred]
Mother!


[Alear]
Let her go!

[Zephia]
All right. Enough with the dramatics.
Huh? You... You look familiar.
[Alear]
...
[Zephia]
No. It couldn't be.
Who are you?
[Alear]
I am the Divine Dragon .
[Zephia]
Such lies. Lumera is the last of her kind.
[Alfred]
Shows what you know. The Divine One was
asleep for a thousand years.
[Zephia]
Really? When did that beastly woman have
a child?
Hmph. Very well. Perhaps you can tell me what
happened to dear Lumera, then.
I've been so worried about her since that awful
battle at Lythos Castle.
[Alear]
How do you know about that?
[Zephia]
How, indeed.
[Alear]
You stole the rings? You killed my mother?!
[Zephia]
She died?! Oh, that poor dear.
[Alear]
Murderer! I will avenge her!
[Zephia]
Why, I didn't kill her.
I will say, your coming here was quite helpful─
assuming you are the beast's offspring.
Because that means you have them, don't you?
The rings of the Hero-King and the Holy Knight.
[Alear]
You'll never take them. Never.
[Alfred]
You were after our ring.
[Zephia]
I won't waste my breath on explanations.
But I will tell you this.
The kingdom of Elusia has freed Lord Sombron
from his imprisonment.
[Alear]
The Fell Dragon has returned?
[Alfred]
No...
[Zephia]
Of course, even we couldn't have accounted
for...you.
His return must have awoken you. Show a
little gratitude.
[Alear]
You're wrong. I awoke because of my mother.
Because she waited for me, all these years...
[Zephia]
A touching tale, I'm sure.
Now, if you'll excuse me.


[Alear]
Wait!

[Alfred]
What can we do?

[Alear]
To start, we defeat these soldiers and take
back the castle.
I'm not going to let them hurt Queen Ève or
anyone else.

[Zephia]
Get the rings. No prisoners.
Irc $ Irc Irc [Boss]
I was hopin' you'd say that.

[Céline]
Alfred, Mother is in the back room! She's OK.
[Alfred]
Oh, that's a relief.

[Ève]
Thank you, all of you, for rescuing me.
My children, you're safe. What a relief.
[Alfred]
We have a guest, Mother. Someone came all
the way from Lythos to see you.
[Ève]
The Divine Dragon ?
[Alfred]

[Céline]


[Alear]
Queen Ève, it's an honor to meet you. I'm so
glad that you're all right.
I've come here by invitation of Prince Alfred.
[Ève]
Just look at you. Awake at long last.
I am Ève, the queen of Firene. It is my absolute
pleasure to welcome you.
[Alfred]
The Divine Dragon has come to help our
country, Mother.
We were just in time to rescue Céline.
And get this! The Divine One summoned
Emblem Celica from our ring.
[Ève]
The legendary Emblem! Oh my,
how extraordinary.
Thank you, sincerely. You have my
deepest gratitude.
My family is safe because of you.
You are blessed with the same powers as
your mother. How is Queen Lumera?
[Alear]
Well, she's...
She's gone. My mother passed away.
[Ève]
No...
That's awful. I'm so sorry.
[Alear]
Some intruders entered the castle. They tried
to kill me, but...
She gave her life to protect mine.
[Ève]
Oh... How tragic...
[Alear]
I'm glad that...that I could spare your children
the pain of losing their mother...
...
[Ève]
My heart goes out to you...
[Alear]
Forgive me. We've only just met and here I am,
laying my grief at your feet.
I just wish I could have saved her too.
[Ève]
Divine One...
While I cannot take away your sorrow, perhaps
I can help you bear it.
To reunite with her, and then lose her so soon...
I can only imagine how painful that was.
For now, allow yourself to grieve, knowing that
I grieve with you.
[Alear]
Thank you, Queen Ève.
Your warmth, your kindness... It's almost like
she's here with me.



[Ève]
How are you feeling?
[Alear]
Better. I'm sorry you had to see me like that.
[Alfred]
No, we shouldn't have dragged you into all
this...right now.
I'm sorry, Divine One.
[Céline]
As am I.
[Alear]
But if I hadn't left when I did, what might have
happened to you, Céline? Or you, Queen Ève?
I'm proud to serve people in need, like my
mother did.
[Alfred]
Thank you.
[Alear]
Now, the Elusian leader... She said her kingdom
released the Fell Dragon.
I take it that's why the Corrupted are appearing
in Elyos again.
[Alfred]
Now there's no question that the Fell Dragon's
after the rings.
Which means we need to hurry. Head them off
before they can reach the next one.
[Alear]
Queen Ève, your country's ring... May I take it?
[Ève]
Of course. The kingdom of Firene gives it with
love, trust, and gratitude.
[Alear]
Thank you very much.
[Ève]
There is something you should know, however...
My kingdom has another Emblem Ring in
its possession.
[Alfred]
What? Since when?
[Céline]
There is another ring? Here, in Firene?
[Ève]
It was kept secret to avoid conflict.
For generations, knowledge of this ring has
been confined to the monarchs of Firene.
However, now that the Fell Dragon has arisen,
it is best to dispel the shroud of secrecy.
It is commonly thought that the Divine Dragon
gave one ring to each country's leader.
However, Firene received a second.
The Ring of the Dawn Maiden.
[Alear]
I see...
[Ève]
To ensure that no one would find it, the ring
was hidden away far from the castle.
It rests in a shrine on the Brodian border.
[Alfred]
Ah, I remember those old ruins.
[Céline]
What? You do?
[Alfred]
Yeah. Mother took me there after Father died.
She told me to keep the location in mind.
At the time, I didn't know why...
Now it makes sense.
[Ève]
I was preparing you for the day you
became king.
[Alfred]
I'll take everyone to the shrine. From there,
I can continue on with the Divine Dragon.
[Ève]
So you are leaving, Alfred.
[Alfred]
Yes. I want to do my part to end this war.
With your blessing, Mother, I'm going to help
the Divine Dragon bring peace to Elyos.
[Céline]
Mother, I would like to join as well.
[Alear]
Alfred... Céline...
[Ève]
You have my blessing. I know you will serve the
Divine Dragon with honor.
On one condition. Swear to me that you will
come back alive.
[Alfred]
I swear it.
[Céline]
I swear it.
[Alear]
Thank you very much, Queen Ève.
[Ève]
I trust that you will take some time to rest prior
to your departure.
The journey ahead will be arduous, but know
that you are all in my prayers.
May good fortune shine upon you.

Hey there! You're the Divine Dragon, right?
Got a second to talk?


[Alear]
Who might you be?
錬成屋
Me, I'm a blacksmith. You can call me Calney.
アクセ屋
And I am Pinet, a clothier. Pleased to meet you.
錬成屋
I'll cut right to it. Our friend Durthon wrote us
and said he opened a shop at your base.
And, well... We'd like to go there too. We'll be a
real help! I can strengthen your weapons.
アクセ屋
My clothes and accessories won't win you any
battles, but they will catch eyes and turn heads.
[Alear]
If Durthon vouches for you, that's good enough
for me. Please, come along to the Somniel.
錬成屋
Really? That's great! You'll be glad to have us
around, I promise.
アクセ屋
Indeed. Thank you, Divine One.

Ugh... OK. I think I lost 'em...
Really! You sure about that, darling?
AH!
You're shaking like a leaf. I take it you failed to
obtain the ring.
Uh! Apologies, ma'am! Those guys were tougher
than they looked!
But I─ I can tell you things! Stuff that'll help you track it
down! Like the fact that Princess Céline ran off with it.
The Divine Dragon has it now.
Pretty good info, right? Heh...
Hmm...
Whaddaya say? How 'bout we call it even this
time around? I won't let you down again.
Oh, how naive you are.
After you fail me once, there is no second chance.
No! Please don't kill me! Please don't kill me!
AAH!
Hmph.

I am sorry, my lady. Apologies for the mess.
And our failure to acquire the ring.

I was expecting to get at least one.
At least now we know that Lumera is dead.
[Zephia]
Yes, but there's another Divine Dragon to take
her place. I can't believe that beast had a child.
[Veyle] フード
It does explain why she was so willing to
sacrifice her life.
[Zephia]
What should we do?
[Veyle] フード
The battle at Lythos Castle took its toll. We're
in no shape for another confrontation.
We best lie low for a spell. Leave them be.
For now.
[Zephia]
Understood.

[Alear]
The door's locked. What should we do?
[Alfred]
There's no time to find the key! Let's use brute
force to knock it down.

[Thief]
Ooo hoo hoo, the castle's under siege!
Mighty fine time to nab some treasure.


[Alear]
Thieves, here, now? That's the last thing we
need. We'd better stop them.


[Alear]
It looks like we can break that wall. We could
catch the enemy by surprise if we do that.

Irc  Irc Irc [Boss]
Hah! That all you got?!

[Alear]
This one's a tough opponent. He can keep on
fighting, even after taking a fatal blow.

Those shiny rings of yours are gonna be mine,

You invaded my castle and threatened my

Oh, the prince of Flowerland is threatening me!
I'm real scared!

Looky here, the runaway princess! I'll make you
fly the coop again.

I am not running this time. It will be you who
flees for your life.

I will show you no mercy. Prepare to die.

Ooo, the Divine Dragon. If I kill you, I won't
