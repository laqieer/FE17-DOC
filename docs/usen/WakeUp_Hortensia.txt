Prepare to be awakened adorably!


Still hiding in bed, huh?
Haha, or maybe you're embarrassed to be seen 
all disheveled.
It's OK. I'm a complete mess first thing in the 
morning too.


Rise and shine!
Whoa, what?
You don't look disheveled at all!
You just roll out of bed perfect?!
I need to reevaluate my life...
I'm gonna go.


Morning!
Does the power of my cuteness have you 
brimming with energy?
I'm happy to be of service!

This room kinda makes me nervous...


I don't know if this is OK.
My whole country worships the Fell Dragon.
I wonder what Father would say if he saw me 
in this place.
And Ivy too...


Morning, Divine One.
What? I look gloomy?
At least use a classy word─like "melancholy."
You're right, though. I've had a lot on my 
mind recently.
But don't worry. I'll still be there when you 
need me.


Ah! You're awake! Uh...
Would you rather I not come in?
Sorry, I'll go.

Elusia's most charming princess is here to 
wake you!


Wow. You're a heavy sleeper.
You don't snore at all either. Amazing.
Hang on... You're still breathing, right?
Uh, Divine One? Hey, are you alive?!


Phew! You're awake.
I'm so relieved.
Don't worry me like that!
You need to take up snoring!
You know, for my sake!


OK, this is gonna be tough.
Wait, you're already up?!
I was ready for you to put up a real struggle!
Well, whatever. Good morning!

Right, time to practice being kind. Here we go.


You always work so hard for the rest of us, 
Divine One.
It's good to see you getting some rest. 
You've earned it.
Look at me─coming in to wake you and 
then telling you to sleep...


Ah, you're up. Feeling rested?
I want you to know I'm grateful for your advice.
I'm trying to think about other people first 
instead of putting on a show.


I usually barge in here...
but today I'll be more gentle.
Aw, you're already awake?!
How am I supposed to be considerate now? 
You ruined it!

A charming princess is here to wake you up.


I got up bright and early today...
and I came straight to you.
I guess I couldn't wait to see you, Divine One.


Morning!
You look nice today.
What? I'm being especially kind?
Huh. That means I'm well on my way to being 
truly charming, doesn't it?


You're awake already?
You could've slept a bit longer, you know. 
I'm early.
Sorry about that, Divine One.


--- A2 ---

Sorry to disturb you, Divine One.


I know better than to barge in here noisily.
That's not what my mother would do, is it?
She knew that real charm is being kind to 
other people.


Good morning.
I seem extra sophisticated today?
If I am, it's thanks to you.
I'll never forget what you taught me.


Morning. What's that look all about?
Glad you noticed. I'm practicing being dignified.
A princess should carry herself with a regal 
bearing, after all.

Your most charming friend is here to wake you!


Moments like this are nice.
Just you and me, y'know?
We're both something special.
So obviously we make a good pair.
But times like this remind me just how well we 
complement each other.
I know you'll always support me, no 
matter what.
I'll do the same for you.


Morning, Divine One!
Before you step out into the big scary world...
let's hang out here for a bit.
Risking our lives can wait, can't it?


You woke up fast!
I was all set to wake you gently too.
Oh well. You're a better conversationalist when 
you're conscious anyway.
Good morning, Divine One.


--- S2 ---

It's me, Divine One.
Your favorite princess, Hortensia!


Strange...
I just remembered we were enemies when we 
first met.
I'd almost forgotten.
That time feels so far away that I don't think 
about it much.
I was such a fool back then. So naive...
Not to mention totally full of myself.
Thank you for guiding me.
I'm a much better person now because of it.


Ah! I didn't realize you were awake!
Were you only pretending to be asleep?!
Hm. It's OK. I don't mind if you heard all that.
It's the truth.


Morning! Already up, I see.
I told you I'd always make time for you, 
so here I am.
I don't check in on all my friends like this, 
you know.
So you don't need to feel jealous.
