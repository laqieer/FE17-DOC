[Alcryst] 
Ah! Prince Fogado!
[Fogado] 
Hey, hey! What's going on, Prince Alcryst? 
Why are you running away from me?
[Alcryst] 
I apologize. You're always in such high spirits... 
I feared my presence might dampen your mood.
[Fogado] 
Yeesh! I think you're being a little hard 
on yourself.
[Fogado] 
Besides, we actually have a lot in common.
[Fogado] 
You're the second prince of a kingdom, I'm the 
first prince of a queendom. Tomato, Fogado.
[Alcryst] 
I suppose you're right.
[Alcryst] 
...
[Fogado] 
Um, why the sigh?
[Alcryst] 
We do hold similar positions. But if that is the 
case...why are we so different?
[Alcryst] 
You're so carefree and sociable...and I am a 
dismal burden on everyone I meet.
[Fogado] 
There you go again. Always so negative.
[Fogado] 
Not that I mind your dour attitude. It's actually 
one of the reasons I like you.
[Alcryst] 
You find me likable?! But that's impossible! 
I don't deserve such kindness.
[Alcryst] 
Oh, this is bad. If you continue, I may find 
myself in a dangerous spot...
[Fogado] 
Aww. What's so dangerous about me?
[Alcryst] 
That! Your gentle eyes and accepting smile! 
Please, don't look at me!
[Alcryst] 
Your pure heart is shining a spotlight on me. 
You'll reveal me for the waste that I am!
[Alcryst] 
I...I have to go!
[Alcryst] 
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!
[Alcryst] 

[Fogado] 
Hahaha, man. That guy really knows how to 
make an exit.

[Fogado] 
Hey, Prince Alcryst! Quick question. Can you 
tell me about your childhood?
[Alcryst] 
Huh? Why do you want to know about that?
[Fogado] 
Well, I was thinking about our somewhat 
abbreviated conversation the other day.
[Fogado] 
You know, how our situations are similar, but 
our personalities are different.
[Fogado] 
And I thought maybe the difference can be 
explained by our upbringings.
[Alcryst] 
I see. I'll share broad details with you, but be 
warned─it's not very interesting.
[Fogado] 
That's totally fine. Trust me, I'm all ears.
[Alcryst] 
I was born the second prince of Brodia, with a 
significant age gap between my brother and me.
[Alcryst] 
As far back as I can remember, people have 
praised my older brother for his skills.
[Alcryst] 
"One could not ask for a better successor to 
the Brodian throne," they would say.
[Alcryst] 
But when it came to me, the thing I heard most 
often was, "Diamant would have done better."
[Fogado] 
Ouch. So you always felt like second fiddle. 
That's rough.
[Alcryst] 
It's my own fault. I'm a lost cause.
[Fogado] 
Did you ever just snap and say, "Forget him! 
Look at me!"
[Alcryst] 
No, never. I would never allow a thought like 
that to cross my mind.
[Alcryst] 
My brother is perfect. That's the plain truth. 
It's not his fault I can't compare.
[Alcryst] 
At the same time, I am aware that those truths 
form the backbone of my gloomy personality.
[Fogado] 
So instead of holding a grudge against him, you 
just accepted that you were inferior.
[Fogado] 
You know what you are? A kind person. Maybe 
that's why I like you so much.
[Alcryst] 
Oh... Gah...
[Alcryst] 
You... You're saying you like me? You're such 
an inspiring person, Prince Fogado.
[Alcryst] 
I must not risk dragging you down!
[Alcryst] 
I have to go again! I'm sorry! I'm sorryyy!
[Alcryst] 

[Fogado] 
And he's gone. Well, see you around, 
Prince Alcryst!

[Fogado] 
Hello, Prince Alcryst.
[Alcryst] 
Guh... Prince Fogado!
[Fogado] 
Haha, I wonder when you'll stop greeting me 
like that.
[Alcryst] 
I'm sorry. Your smile shines so bright... My first 
impulse is always to flee.
[Alcryst] 
I must ask...how did you grow to be such a 
powerful beacon of good humor?
[Fogado] 
You want to know about my childhood? Well, I 
can give you a quick synopsis.
[Fogado] 
Not that there was anything all that remarkable 
about it.
[Fogado] 
Being the first prince of Solm, I received a 
formal education.
[Fogado] 
But there weren't many rules holding me down. 
I was allowed to roam free.
[Fogado] 
I used to sneak out of the palace all the time 
and just...hit the town. Have fun.
[Alcryst] 
Amazing. I'd heard that the people of Solm 
celebrate their freedom...
[Alcryst] 
But I had no idea that applied to royalty as well.
[Alcryst] 
I'm beginning to understand how that lifestyle 
shaped the prince I see now...
[Alcryst] 
A warm, outstanding person who makes new 
friends as easily as he greets the day.
[Fogado] 
Thanks, Prince Alcryst. I appreciate that.
[Alcryst] 
Ah... Once again, your radiant gaze... I might 
crumble into ashes!
[Fogado] 
Hold up! Before you run away, let me 
say something.
[Fogado] 
And this is going to be hard, because you're 
terrible at taking compliments.
[Alcryst] 
Oh no. I'm so sorry.
[Fogado] 
No, not that. Maybe, just this once, could you 
believe me when I say I like you?
[Fogado] 
I'd even go so far as to call you, my fellow 
kid-brother prince, a friend.
[Alcryst] 
Oh... Oh, Prince Fogado.
[Alcryst] 
I do. I-I believe you.
[Alcryst] 
Thank you for calling someone like me a friend.
[Alcryst] 
I like you, too, Prince Fogado...
[Fogado] 
At last, you finally came out and said it! 
You liiike me! You liiike me!
[Alcryst] 
Ah! Ahh! I don't know what came over me!
[Alcryst] 
To think I could reciprocate─I had no right. I'm 
so sorry.
[Fogado] 
What are you apologizing for? Now we know we 
like each other. We're basically best friends.
[Alcryst] 
Best friends? I've never had a best friend.
[Alcryst] 
I will admit, that makes me a bit─ No, it makes 
me a LOT happy. Thank you, Prince Fogado.
