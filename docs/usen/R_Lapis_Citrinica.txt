=== Lapis & Citrinne ===

[Citrinne]
Ha! Hyah! Hup!
[Citrinne]
Ah...
[Citrinne]
That was a bit better than yesterday...but still
far from acceptable.

[Lapis]
Citrinne? What are you doing up so late?
[Citrinne]
Ah!
[Citrinne]
Oh, Lapis. You frightened me.
[Citrinne]
If you must know, I was just...brushing up on
my ballroom dancing.
[Lapis]
Hmm. You're not a very good liar. I could see
you using magic. Are you training in secret?
[Citrinne]
You found me out.
[Lapis]
Working this late can't be good for your health.
You should really get some sleep soon.
[Citrinne]
I appreciate your concern, Lapis, but...I can't
let myself rest.
[Lapis]
You can't?
[Citrinne]
If I had your strength, I might not have to train
myself well into the small hours of the night.
[Citrinne]
But...things are different for me. I must, must,
must grow stronger.
[Lapis]
Oh. Citrinne, that's...
[Citrinne]
Don't stay up for my sake. I promise to rest as
well, but only after I've done enough for tonight.
[Lapis]
...
[Lapis]
Just don't push yourself too hard, OK? G'night.
[Citrinne]
Good night, Lapis.

[Lapis]
Ahh, I love packages from Mom and Dad.
I wonder what this could possibly be...
[Lapis]
Haha, as if I don't already know.
[Lapis]
Ooo, they sent some really good ones this time!
These look extra yummy. Mmm...


[Citrinne]
Lapis? What has you cooing and humming?
[Lapis]
AH! Citrinne?!
[Lapis]
You really scared me. Don't sneak up on people
in the dark, making such a scary face...
[Citrinne]
Should I have worn a mask? I doubt that would
have been less frightening.
[Citrinne]
This is just my face, Lapis. Don't be cruel.
[Lapis]
Sorry. I didn't mean it. You just really
startled me.
[Citrinne]
Oh, what tasty-looking yams! Did you have
someone fetch these from the countryside?
[Lapis]
No, I didn't. They, uh... I...
[Citrinne]
It looks as if your parents sent them. Does your
family...own land near a potato farm?
[Citrinne]
It was my understanding that your parents live
in town. Is that not the case?
[Lapis]
Uh...
[Lapis]
OK. I'll tell you the truth, Citrinne. My parents
don't live anywhere near town.
[Citrinne]
Oh?
[Lapis]
My parents─actually, my whole family─lives in
the countryside where these taters came from.
[Citrinne]
Is that so? But you've always said that─
[Lapis]
I lied. I shouldn't have, but I did. Please don't
tell anyone else, OK?
[Citrinne]
I won't. Of course I won't. But...I'm confused.
Why would you lie about such a thing?
[Lapis]
I was trying to make myself seem less...you
know...rural.
[Lapis]
I worry about that all the time. Prince Alcryst
is royalty. You're part of his extended family.
[Lapis]
A bumpkin like me doesn't belong next to such
noble company.
[Citrinne]
Lapis! That's not true! It doesn't matter if─
[Lapis]
It matters to me. I wish my family tree was as
impressive as yours, but...
[Lapis]
Things are different for me.
[Citrinne]
Oh, Lapis...
[Citrinne]
You and I make a perfect match.
[Lapis]
Huh?
[Citrinne]
You see your family's social standing as your
hindrance, while I see lack of strength as mine.
[Citrinne]
Each of us has what the other lacks.
[Lapis]
Huh. You're right.
[Citrinne]
Your secret is safe with me. I'll leave you be.
I have to begin my midnight training, after all.
[Citrinne]
Good night, Lapis.
[Lapis]
G'night, Citrinne.
--- A ---



[Lapis]
There you are, Citrinne! I've been waiting.
[Citrinne]
Oh? Whatever for, Lapis?
[Lapis]
I was hoping to join you for midnight training.
It's sure to be more fun with a partner, right?
[Citrinne]
Oh my! But it would be terrible of me to deprive
you of a full night's rest.
[Lapis]
Please. I'm the terrible one. I still feel bad about
the last time we talked.
[Lapis]
Besides, I can't sleep if I know a good friend is
working through the night.
[Citrinne]
Lapis... You're so kind.
[Citrinne]
I had something that I wanted to offer you as
well. Here, take this.
[Lapis]
A note? No, an address. What is this?
[Citrinne]
That's the mailing address for one of my
family's spare manors in the heart of town.
[Citrinne]
We haven't lived there in quite a while, so it's
only staffed by grounds- and housekeepers.
[Lapis]
OK...but why are you giving me the address?
[Citrinne]
If you wish to hide your rural origins, you must
consider where your care packages come from.
[Citrinne]
Think of this as your new forwarding service!
[Citrinne]
If your parents send their packages there, the
staff will swap addresses and route them here.
[Citrinne]
Why, your family could even use that address as
a vacation home. Or they could just move in.
[Citrinne]
The manor is theirs to use as they like.
[Lapis]
Wow...
[Lapis]
Citrinne, thank you. I didn't realize how much
you cared.
[Citrinne]
Think nothing of it. I'm just looking out for one
of my dearest friends.
[Lapis]
It's a wonderful offer, but...I can't accept it.
[Citrinne]
What? Why not?
[Lapis]
My family isn't noble, but I'm proud of them.
I can't ask them to hide where they're from.
[Lapis]
I'm still nervous about other people finding out,
but at least I won't have to worry around you.
[Citrinne]
Oh my...
[Citrinne]
We are quite the pair, aren't we? Each of us has
what the other lacks.
[Lapis]
And we both reach out when the other
needs help.
[Citrinne]
Not a bad working relationship.
[Lapis]
Not bad at all.
[Lapis]
Do you think Prince Alcryst had this balance
in mind when he selected us as his retainers?
[Citrinne]
Oh, I doubt it. I know you're enamored with
him, but Alcryst isn't that clever.
[Lapis]
What? I-I am not!
[Citrinne]
Goodness! You're blushing. Your cheeks are as
red as the carpets in the royal court.
[Lapis]
Come on, don't tease me.
[Lapis]
Besides, those carpets aren't that red. You
should see the tomatoes they grow back home!
[Citrinne]
Oh? That sounds like a fun day trip. Would you
show me around sometime?
[Lapis]
Sure! But don't bring any money. The farmers
back home prefer to use a barter system.
[Citrinne]
How rustic! I've always wanted to try bartering.
I could stand to part with a few necklaces...
[Lapis]
Heh, careful! With goods like that, you'll end up
needing that spare manor for tomato storage.
