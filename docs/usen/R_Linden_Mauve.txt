=== Lindon & Mauvier ===
--- C ---



[Lindon]
Ah, Mauvier! Do you have a moment? I'd like
your help with an experiment.
[Mauvier]
Sir Lindon. Of course, I will help however I can.
[Lindon]
I need you to take this ear of corn...and throw
it up into the air.
[Mauvier]
What sort of experiment is this?
[Lindon]
I'm going to blast the corn with Elthunder and
make it explode.
[Lindon]
By my calculations, this will cause its kernels to
"pop" evenly, making for an immaculate snack!
[Mauvier]
This seems...ill thought out.
[Lindon]
Well, you know what they say... "No risk, no
reward, no snacktime."
[Lindon]
I suppose the most likely risk is that you might
"pop" instead...and not evenly, at that.
[Mauvier]
Then I must decline.
[Lindon]
What? Oh, come now! Haven't you learned that
you should always help your elders?
[Mauvier]
Have you not learned to never cast Elthunder
near other people outside of battle?
[Lindon]
Hm! You argue like an elder yourself.
[Mauvier]
I am more than happy to help with any and
all experiments.
[Mauvier]
However, I will not risk my life for corn.
My apologies, Sir Lindon.
[Lindon]
Oh, very well. I suppose snack time is
postponed...for now.

[Mauvier]
Sir Lindon, you dropped something.
[Lindon]
Oh! How clumsy of me. Thank you, Mauvier.
[Mauvier]
This is...the likeness of a young woman.
She is quite beautiful.
[Lindon]
Ah! I heartily agree.
[Lindon]
This is a drawing of my late wife.
[Mauvier]
Oh. Your wife, Sir Lindon.
[Lindon]
She wasn't just beautiful. She was kind, loving...
and the best friend I could have asked for.
[Lindon]
It's been some time since she passed, yet my
love for her continues to grow.
[Lindon]
Ah, how I wish I could see her smile once more,
taste her cooking again...
[Mauvier]
It hurts to see you sad. If there is anything
I can do...
[Lindon]
Do you mean it? Oh, what a wonderful offer.
Thank you, Mauvier!
[Lindon]
Now, take this corn and hurl it skyward.
[Mauvier]
What?!
[Mauvier]
Not this again!
[Lindon]
Oh, but...my dear, late wife loved corn, you see.
She would want us to celebrate her this way.
[Lindon]
Now then, whenever you're ready! I'm standing
by to blast!
[Lindon]
I know what you're thinking, but don't worry.
I probably─no, almost definitely─won't miss!
[Mauvier]
No. Goodbye, Sir Lindon.
[Mauvier]

[Lindon]
Mauvier? Mauvier, wait! You still have my corn!

[Lindon]
...

[Mauvier]
Sir Lindon? Is all well? Is that your
wife's picture?
[Lindon]
Hehe, you've caught me in a vulnerable
moment. How embarrassing.
[Lindon]
A man my age should know when to let go of
the past. Quite unbecoming of me...
[Mauvier]
There is nothing at all embarrassing about
having a deep love for your spouse.
[Lindon]
Ah, you're right, of course.
[Lindon]
We raised three children, you know.
They're all grown now, living their lives.
[Lindon]
They have their own homes, their own families...
It's become difficult to gather all of us together.
[Lindon]
The further we grow apart, the brighter my
memories seem to shine.
[Lindon]
More and more, I find myself looking backward
rather than forward.
[Lindon]
I'm not sure how to change that...or if I should.
[Mauvier]
Having memories you enjoy looking back on is
proof of a life well lived.
[Mauvier]
My own life knows more regrets than happiness.
[Lindon]
Ah, but you are now free to carve out a new
life─one more fulfilling than my own, perhaps.
[Mauvier]
Hmm. Thank you for the kind words, Sir Lindon.
[Lindon]
Think nothing of it. Now...do you find yourself
in the mood for experimental snacking science?
[Mauvier]
I should have known!
[Lindon]
You speak of regrets? Never tasting Elthunder-
popped corn would be most regrettable indeed.
[Mauvier]
It is my understanding that I have a fulfilling life
ahead, so be true with your aim.
[Lindon]
Huzzah! Let the experiment begin!
