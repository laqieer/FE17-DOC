Pardon me.


I'm reluctant to enter like this...
But this is my duty.
Divine One... Divine One?


Good morning.
It's just me today.
Is this wake-up call too formal for you?
My apologies.


You wake so quickly.
Useful if there's an attack.
I'll leave you be.

"The knight approached the altar..."


"Deep at rest, the figure on the altar seemed 
frozen in time..."
"Without warning, the knight caused a horrible 
clatter, shattering the serenity..."
Hah, I could never.


"The knight spoke...
"inviting the Divine Dragon to wake."
Good morning. How do you feel today?


"And the sound of the knight's footsteps quickly 
woke the Divine Dragon."
Good morning, Divine One.


--- B1 ---

Hm, it's quiet here... A good place 
for mindfulness.


I have a spare bit of time... I'll meditate.
Go beyond material thoughts...
Ah, an idea for my next comedy...


Ah, you're awake.
I'll take my leave.
I must write this idea down before I forget...


Sorry to disturb the silence.
It's nearly time. Make yourself ready to depart.

"The knight heard the Divine Dragon sleeping..."


You're so kind, Divine One...
Your chose to stay by my side earlier.
Someday, somehow, I will repay you for your 
many acts of selflessness.


How are you this morning?
You care for our allies...
but make sure you care for yourself as well.


Good morning.
Yesterday's sunset was gorgeous, just as 
you said.
Perhaps today's weather will be good as well.

I can't believe something so funny happened 
all the way up here.


Like a scene from my own novels...
I can't get it out of my head.
This is bad... Heh, I shouldn't laugh in here, 
but... Heh.


Sorry for waking you with my laughter.
I slipped on a fruit peel earlier...
and hit the ground like a sack of hammers! Hah!


Divine One, listen...
Moments ago, I slipped on a stray fruit peel...
Promise you'll stay alert out there, OK?


--- A2 ---

Area secure. I've been guarding the door.


Sorry for the concern earlier.
It made me happy...
You know, when you offered to help me 
confront my past.


Good morning.
Count on me for anything you need, OK?
My "Iron Wall" is at your disposal.


You're awake?
I can leave if you'd prefer...
Oh, you wish to speak with me?
No, no─I'm honored.

"The knight stepped inside her dearest 
ally's chambers..."


"Her partner was there, at rest atop the altar..."
Heh, what a lovely scene.
I may never tire of this.
If only I could find the right words...
But this is fine─just being together, always.
I'll weave the words eventually.


Heh, I'm sorry.
Don't mind me. I just felt like smiling.
After all, I am very happy...
It's an honor to be your partner.


"Red and blue eyes opened to greet her..."
Heh, could you tell it was me by my footsteps?
If so, then...I'm glad. Good morning to you.


--- S2 ---

Whenever I come here, it feels like my face may 
fall off from smiling too much...


It's so strange...
I'm used to this happening when I think up an 
idea for a novel.
But when I look at the Pact Ring, I break into 
a smile.
I try to meditate, but I can't focus.
When I think of you...
I feel like the happiest person in the world.


Morning. Heh, were you listening to me?
That's a bit embarrassing...
But I don't regret a thing.
Hehe.


Aah... Whenever I look at you...
I can't help but lower my guard.
I'm used to good humor...
but now I feel unbridled joy.
