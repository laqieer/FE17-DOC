[Seadall] 
Spirit of the cards, cast your divine light so 
that I may see the correct path forward!
[Seadall] 
HAAA!
[Chloé] 
Seadall! I heard you shouting. What's going on?
[Seadall] 
Oh, Chloé. I'm in the middle of a very 
important reading.
[Chloé] 
You yell when you're reading?
[Seadall] 
Look at this.
[Seadall] 
Right here, before me...meat sizzling on the fire, 
dripping and juicy. Oh, how tempting.
[Seadall] 
But my dancing will be less than disciplined if I 
let my passion for savory flavors rule me.
[Seadall] 
My body is my instrument. I must be vigilant. 
So, here I sit, consulting the cards.
[Chloé] 
Hah, sounds like fun.
[Chloé] 
Well? What did the cards tell you?
[Seadall] 
As much as it pains me to say, it appears I'm 
not destined to eat this meat.
[Chloé] 
More for me, then!
[Seadall] 
Moon and stars! I thought you'd protest at 
least a little bit.
[Seadall] 
Oh well, go ahead. Though must you enjoy it 
so much?
[Chloé] 
Thanks for the meal, Seadall. Next time, it'll be 
my treat!
[Seadall] 
If you say so. Sounds...delicious.

[Chloé] 
Well, Seadall? What do you think?
[Seadall] 
Is this supposed to be...food?
[Chloé] 
Of course it is.
[Seadall] 
What exactly am I looking at? What are the 
ingredients? How was it prepared?
[Chloé] 
It's eggs cooked in sugar.
[Seadall] 
Eggs...from what?
[Chloé] 
From a rare fish caught in Firene's waters, for 
the most part.
[Seadall] 
"For the most part"?! What kind of eggs are 
in here?
[Chloé] 
The delicious kind, of course. You've got 
nothing to worry about.
[Seadall] 
Oh, I'm worried all right.
[Seadall] 
But...you went to all this effort to bring food 
to me. It would be rude not to give it a try.
[Seadall] 
Ugh, the look...the smell...it's ruining 
my appetite...
[Chloé] 
Folk food isn't for everyone.
[Seadall] 
I'm sorry, Chloé. I don't think it's for me.
[Chloé] 
What a shame. This kind of thing might have 
bold flavors that won't trip up your footwork.
[Seadall] 
What?!
[Seadall] 
You found a dish...that's flavorful yet won't 
distract my dancing?
[Seadall] 
I spoke too soon. I will eat your folk food.
[Chloé] 
That's great! Go ahead and dig in.
[Seadall] 
Here we go...
[Seadall] 
...
[Chloé] 
Still can't stomach it, huh?
[Seadall] 
No, it's...actually quite tasty. Bitter and sweet, 
but I like that about it.
[Chloé] 
Really? What a relief. The flavor's so strong that 
I was worried you couldn't keep it down.
[Seadall] 
You wouldn't believe what I ate when I traveled 
with the caravan. I have a strong stomach.
[Seadall] 
Maybe sometime you could teach me more 
about these kinds of dishes.
[Chloé] 
I'd be happy to. And Seadall? Thanks for giving 
it an honest try.

[Seadall] 
And a one, two, three, four...
[Chloé] 1 
[Chloé] 
I never get tired of watching you dance.
[Seadall] 
Checking up on me, Chloé? I'd have set up a 
front-row seat if I'd known you were watching.
[Chloé] 
Well, I didn't want to interrupt your practice.
[Chloé] 
But I brought some new folk food for you to try: 
honey-glazed gecko! It's good for you, I swear.
[Seadall] 
It looks...appetizing, as always. But thank you.
[Seadall] 
The flavors are good. Unusual, no doubt, but 
I love the sweetness.
[Chloé] 
Aha! Just as I thought.
[Chloé] 
I've brought you enough folk food to figure out 
the secret─you'll eat anything if it's sweet!
[Seadall] 
I'm not sure about that...
[Chloé] 
You know, you really are a wonderful dancer. 
Very graceful, but with such power.
[Chloé] 
Did someone teach you?
[Seadall] 
Yes. I have a master─the teacher in the caravan. 
He taught me to dance.
[Seadall] 
I guess I should say that I "had" a master.
[Chloé] 
Does that mean...
[Seadall] 
He died during a raid on the caravan. He was 
protecting me.
[Chloé] 
Oh no...
[Seadall] 
I never got a chance to repay my debt to him. 
It's the only fate I couldn't foresee.
[Chloé] 
But your master's dancing lives on in you, 
doesn't it?
[Seadall] 
I hope so. But I have a long way to go before 
I achieve his level of skill.
[Seadall] 
Still, I do my best to mesmerize my audience 
through the sublime art of dance.
[Chloé] 
I have no doubt you've done that.
[Seadall] 
Hm-hm. Thank you, Chloé.
[Seadall] 
And now that I've eaten, it's time to dance.
[Seadall] 
I was going to give you a special performance as 
a thank-you, but how about we dance together?
[Chloé] 
I would love nothing more.
