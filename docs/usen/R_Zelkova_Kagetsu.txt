[Zelkov] 
Hmm...
[Zelkov] 
Yes. This is *acceptable.*
[Kagetsu] 
Zelkov! Training bout! Now!
[Zelkov] 
Yaah!
[Zelkov] 
Must you insist on *startling* me so?
[Kagetsu] 
Did I catch you off-guard? Haha, come now. 
You are better than that.
[Kagetsu] 
Our work for Princess Ivy demands unflappable 
mettle! Your will must be steel!
[Kagetsu] 
So, training bout! Face me!
[Zelkov] 
Apologies, but I am presently *preoccupied.*
[Kagetsu] 
What is it this time? Watching birds? 
Sculpting clay?
[Kagetsu] 
Your smirk tells me it must be some silly 
new obsession.
[Zelkov] 
I am painting. And I require *silence* to focus, 
if you would be so kind.
[Kagetsu] 
I knew it would be painting someday. Set it 
aside for now. Single combat awaits!
[Zelkov] 
This pursuit is *important* to me. Please find 
another training partner.
[Kagetsu] 
...
[Kagetsu] 
Is this art of yours more important to you than 
our friendship, Zelkov?
[Kagetsu] 
You are my only colleague! It is important 
we spend time together.
[Zelkov] 
Mm-hmm...
[Kagetsu] 
Too focused to respond. Ignoring me 
completely. Seems I am alone again.

[Kagetsu] 
Zelkov! Our time is at hand. Prepare yourself!
[Zelkov] 
Again, I am *afraid* I must decline.
[Kagetsu] 
Ugh! I tire of hearing that! It is not your right 
to deny me this way!
[Kagetsu] 
Face me in mock battle now, or...I will fight 
your artwork in your place.
[Zelkov] 
What?
[Kagetsu] 
You always have time for some trivial 
obsession! Never for your friend!
[Kagetsu] 
How are we supposed to bond?!
[Zelkov] 
Calm yourself. I hear your *concerns,* but 
destroying my art will not make this better.
[Zelkov] 
It would only *ensure* I not speak to you again. 
Put down your weapon, Kagetsu.
[Kagetsu] 
Hahaha!
[Zelkov] 
What about this is *amusing* to you?
[Kagetsu] 
This tense mood! Do you feel it? It is as if we 
are rivals, destined for conflict!
[Kagetsu] 
At last, you are taking me seriously!
[Kagetsu] 
If you will not face me as my friend, then 
at least you will do so as my opponent!
[Zelkov] 
*Enough.*
[Kagetsu] 
What, standing down already? Does your art 
mean so little to you after all?
[Zelkov] 
I have seen your eyes. You lack the conviction 
of a killer. You are a *child* seeking attention.
[Kagetsu] 
Child?! How dare you!
[Zelkov] 
Leave me. This is a *genuine* warning.
[Kagetsu] 
I get no say in this at all, do I?

[Kagetsu] 
Zelkov! It is now time...
[Kagetsu] 
for me to stop challenging you. It does not 
matter anymore.
[Zelkov] 
You seem less than *pleased* about it.
[Kagetsu] 
I know that you...dislike me.
[Zelkov] 
*Dislike* you? What makes you say so?
[Kagetsu] 
Come on. It is clear you and Princess Ivy both 
care little for me.
[Kagetsu] 
It makes me sad. I...wanted to be friends.
[Zelkov] 
*Friends*? Ugh, you are a fool.
[Zelkov] 
I had meant to wait until Princess Ivy was 
present to *reveal* this, but...
[Zelkov] 
*Here* is what I have been painting.
[Kagetsu] 
What is this?
[Zelkov] 
My *completed* work. The three of usâ”€you, 
Princess Ivy, and myself.
[Kagetsu] 
You...included me. Why?
[Zelkov] 
Princess Ivy intended this as a gift for you. 
To *celebrate.*
[Kagetsu] 
Celebrate what?
[Zelkov] 
The day she and I *met* you. 
Have you forgotten?
[Zelkov] 
Today is the anniversary of that day.
[Kagetsu] 
Oh.
[Zelkov] 
You came to Elusia Castle in search of 
challenging *duels.*
[Zelkov] 
Your search for stronger *opponents* led you 
all the way from your homeland to us.
[Kagetsu] 
I defeated every foe the castle could muster 
for me...until you.
[Kagetsu] 
That was my first ever defeat. I was crushed.
[Zelkov] 
But King Hyacinth was *delighted* by your 
skill. He pressed you into Princess Ivy's service.
[Kagetsu] 
You and Princess Ivy had such looks on 
your faces.
[Kagetsu] 
You were both so displeased and so angry.
[Zelkov] 
You had just cut your way through every castle 
*guard* for reasons we could only guess at.
[Kagetsu] 
Yes, it must have looked bad to you. I am sorry 
for that.
[Zelkov] 
I was indeed rather angry at the time, but 
all is *forgiven* now.
[Zelkov] 
Princess Ivy has forgiven you as well. That is 
why she now *celebrates* the day we met.
[Zelkov] 
You are important to her.
[Kagetsu] 
Zelkov... Thank you...
[Zelkov] 
Are you...*crying*?
[Zelkov] 
No matter. I was about to go find Princess Ivy. 
Perhaps you would *accompany* me?
[Kagetsu] 
I will wait here. I don't want her to see me 
this way.
[Zelkov] 
Do not *concern* yourself about that.
[Zelkov] 
Princess Ivy might actually *approve* of seeing 
this side of you.
[Kagetsu] 
Do you think so? Are you both so truly 
accepting of me?
[Zelkov] 
Come, Kagetsu.
[Kagetsu] 
My heart bursts with love for you and Princess 
Ivy! My exploded heart will love you forever!
