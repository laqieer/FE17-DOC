=== Chapter 10 The Fell Dragon Sombron ===

(Destinea Cathedral)
The Divine Dragon's army rushes
to Destinea Cathedral to rescue
King Morion.

--- OP ---



[Hortensia]
Aw, the snow's really coming down out there.
[Rosado]
Yeah, the cathedral always gets hit harder than
anywhere else, huh?
[Hortensia]
And Ivy's late. We've been waiting here for
ages. What if she never comes?
Maybe things went bad at Brodia Castle and
she didn't survive...
[Rosado]
No way! Princess Ivy can handle herself!
[Hortensia]
Thanks, Rosado. You're sweet.
Ugh... Why is this happening, anyway?
Ever since Lord Sombron was released, Father's
been acting weird.
He used to be so kind to me! But since they
came into the picture, it's like I hardly exist.
[Rosado]
You mean the ones who showed up at Elusia
Castle with Lord Sombron?
[Hortensia]
Yeah. That kid with the hood and the four
weirdos who follow her around.
Father probably only likes them because they
brought him so many rings.
I thought if I could get him some, he might
praise me like he used to...
Heh, look how that turned out!
[Rosado]
I'm sorry, Hortensia...
[Hortensia]
It's not your fault. What happened at the Grand
Crossing...that was all me.
I just... I don't have any clue what Father's
up to.
I don't know why he wants the rings or what
this ritual's about. I'm totally in the dark!
[Goldmary]
Hortensia? Pardon me for interrupting.
[Hortensia]
Hey, Goldmary.
[Goldmary]
King Hyacinth has asked you to join him at
the altar.
And he wants you to have this.
[Hortensia]
An Emblem Ring?
[Rosado]
Whoa, the king gave you another one, huh?
[Goldmary]
He said you should wear it and prepare yourself
for battle.
[Hortensia]
That must mean the Divine Dragon is coming.
Good. I'll get some answers about what
happened at Brodia Castle.
Let's go, you two.



[Alear]
We've arrived. Destinea Cathedral.
Veyle's directions really did help.
Let's head inside, quickly.

[Marth]
Hold on a moment.
[Alear]
What is it, Marth?
[Marth]
I sense the Fell Dragon's presence. He's waiting
for us inside the cathedral.
[Alear]
...
[Marth]
We're not ready to fight him. If the ritual has
been completed, we should retreat.
And even if it hasn't, I think we had best escape
at the first sign of danger.
[Alear]
You mean, leave King Morion behind?
[Marth]
I'm worried about all this. We shouldn't stay
any longer than we have to.
Whatever we do, we must avoid a direct
encounter with the Fell Dragon.
[Alear]
It'll be all right. Princess Ivy said that Sombron
can hardly move, remember?
Plus, we have half of the Emblem Rings. Even if
they had the rest, we'd be evenly matched.
[Marth]
It is true that with the allies we've gained,
we are formidable.
But I urge you, as our leader─do not fall prey
to overconfidence.
[Alear]
Perhaps I am being too bold.
Still, despite everything we're facing, I'm calm.
I think it's because you're here, Marth.
[Marth]
Me?
[Alear]
With you and the other Emblems supporting us,
we're all feeling more courageous.
I hope you'll always stay with us.
[Marth]
We're not going anywhere. We will remain by
your side until the end of this journey.
[Alear]
Thank you.
Now, is everyone ready? It's time to put a stop
to this ritual and bring King Morion home.

Default


[Hyacinth]
I bid you welcome to Destinea Cathedral. We're
so happy to greet you, loathsome Divine Dragon.
[Alear]
Spare us your lies.
[Hyacinth]
Alas, your presence indicates that Ivy lost her
battle. A predictable outcome, of course.
You don't appear to have taken her captive.
I assume her body has been left for the birds.
[Hortensia]
You mean my sister...is dead?
[Alear]
Where have you hidden King Morion?
[Hyacinth]
All will be known in due time.
[Alear]
Tell us─now!
[Hyacinth]
[Hortensia]
[Alfred]
Look, over there! There's someone beside the altar.
[Alfred]


[Alcryst]
Can it be... Diamant, it's Father─he's alive!
[Alcryst]
[Diamant]
Don't worry, Father! We're here to save you!


[Morion]
Urgh...
[Diamant]
Something's wrong...
[Morion]
Ngh...
Raaaaaargh!
[Diamant]
Father!
[Alear]
He's been...
[Hyacinth]
It appears you were a few moments too late.
As you can see, the ritual has been carried out.
[Diamant]
Hyacinth... You bastard!
[Diamant]
[Marth]
We have to leave at once, . Call a
retreat without delay.
[Alear]
We can't!
[Marth]
King Morion is beyond our aid.
[Marth]


[Alcryst]
What do you mean?
You would have us...leave our own father behind?
I cannot! I will not abandon him here!
[Alcryst]
[Diamant]
The only option is to fight Hyacinth. I won't flee
after...after what he has done!
[Alear]
Diamant... Alcryst...
[Diamant]
[Hyacinth]
Foolish, but I'm not a bit surprised. Hm.
[Alear]
The doors!
[Marth]
Yes. We're trapped within!
[Hyacinth]
This grand cathedral will serve as your grave.
Thanks to your impetuousness, you brought the
rings unto my very hand.
[Alear]
Hyacinth, you...
[Hyacinth]


[Alcryst]
You're a monster... That's our father!
[Alcryst]
[Diamant]
You're going to pay for this. Here and now!
[Alear]
So be it, Hyacinth. Now we fight!


--- ED ---




[Alear]
We've won, Hyacinth. It's over.
[Hyacinth]
Get away! Do not come near me!
[Diamant]
And now, I avenge my father.
HYAH!
[Hyacinth]
Aah!
[Diamant]
Urgh!
[Alear]
That spell...
[Veyle] フード 3
[Veyle] フード
Heh...
[Alear]
It's you. The one who killed my mother.
[Hyacinth]
Oh, thank you, thank you! I thought I was
finished there.
[Veyle] フード
I'm not being merciful. Merely pragmatic.
The ritual was a success. The Fell Dragon will
be here in a moment.
[Hyacinth]
He can move once again? That means the
sacrifice worked!
[Alear]
...
[Veyle] フード
Here he comes.

[Veyle] フード 1

[Hortensia]
AH! FATHER!
[Alear]
King Hyacinth...
[Alfred]
I thought he and the Fell Dragon were on the
same side.
[Veyle] フード
Hahaha! Now that was entertaining.
[Hortensia]
What?!
[Veyle] フード
Hehehe, did you see his face? The shock!
The betrayal!
[Hortensia]
Stop laughing! What's wrong with you?

Is that...Veyle?
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
You irritating girl.
[Hortensia]
Ahh!
[Hortensia]
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
You had to go and ruin my fun. This is why
I detest humans.
[Alear]
No, it can't be. But...that's the bandage I used
to dress her wound.
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
I should introduce myself. I am Sombron's
daughter, the Fell Princess.
You may call me Veyle. Pleased to make
your acquaintance.
[Alear]
Veyle... What do you mean, "the Fell Princess"?
How could you deceive us like this?
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
Deceive you? We've never even spoken before.
[Alear]
What?!

[Sombron]
Enough idle chatter, Veyle. Take the rings.
[Veyle] フード 顔出し
As you wish, Father.

[Zephia]
Well, well, well! If it isn't the Divine Dragon and
their merry band. Fancy running into you here.
[Alear]
It's you again.
[Alfred]
I know you! You're the wretch who stormed
Firene Castle!
[Zephia]
Wretch? Not much of a greeting, that. But I guess the
fault is mine for not properly introducing myself.
You have my apologies for my man's actions in Firene.
I take responsibility for what he's done. Take comfort
in the fact I killed him myself.
[Alfred]
What?!
[Alfred]
[Zephia]
As for who I am, my name is Zephia. I am a Mage Dragon of great
power...and Lord Sombron's humble servant in all things.
As for my companions here...they are like family to me.
Together, we are known as the Four Hounds.
[Griss]
Hah! You tell yourself that. She's a dragon, and
the rest of us are humans. Family, she calls us...
The name's Griss, and I'm not the prisoner-taking type.
[Griss]
[Marni]
Call me Marni. I heard we'd be meeting some royalty
today...but you look like a bunch of losers to me.
[Marni]
[Mauvier]
I am Mauvier. The pleasure is all mine. Lady Veyle
has told us much about you.
[Mauvier]

[Alear]
I don't care what you call yourselves. You're in
our way. Now stand aside!
Come on. We can fight our way past them.
Everyone, engage with Emblems!

[Veyle]
Hm-hm-hm...
[Alear]
Huh? The rings!
[Veyle]
Something the matter?
[Alear]
Ah!
[Veyle]
The Draconic Time Crystal. Of course, you had
it with you all along.
Sorry, but I just had to take it back again. I grabbed
it during your little chat with Zephia.
Amazing you didn't notice. You must not be very bright.
[Alear]
Hold on... You used it?
[Veyle]
Yes. Now all your rings are here, right where
they belong.
[Alear]
Give... Give them back!
[Veyle]
Six, eh? I have to admit, I'm impressed.
Father. The Emblem Rings.
[Alear]
...
[Zephia]


[Sombron]
Well done. Now the rings are in my possession. Good.
Now, to purge them of any trace of Divine Dragon power.
To begin... The Ring of the Hero-King.
[Alear]
Marth!
[Marth]
[Sombron]
Shine on, Emblem of Beginnings.
[Marth]
Argh... Ah... Ah! AAH!
...
[Alear]
Marth?! Marth, speak to me! Please!
[Veyle]
It's no use. My father's fell power is now coursing
through the Emblem Ring.
He's no longer the sweet little Marth you knew.
[Alear]
No, please...
[Sombron]
Provide for us, Emblem of the Holy War.
[Marth]

[Veyle]

[Alear]
Sigurd!
[Sombron]
Care for us, Emblem of Echoes.
Heal us, Emblem of Dawn.
[Sigurd]

[Alear]
Celica! Micaiah! Stop it...just stop!
[Sombron]
Free us, Emblem of Genealogy.
Rise up, Emblem of Binding.
[Celica]
[Micaiah]


[Alear]
Leif! Roy! I can't do this without you...
[Leif]
[Roy]

[Veyle]
Hahaha! Say goodbye to your beloved Emblems.
Now they belong to us.
Oh, how I wanted these two. Marth...and Sigurd.
After killing Lumera, I was forced to leave them
back there with you.
Do you have any idea how irritating that was for me?!
[Alear]
Veyle!

[Vander]
We must retreat, Divine One!
[Veyle]
Oh...so now you want to turn tail and run? We
have all your rings, and you have nothing.
Abandon hope. You will all die.
[Alear]
Give them back. Give them back to me!

[Corrupted] ( [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Morion]
Raaargh...


[Alcryst]
Father, it's me! It's your son!
[Alcryst]
[Alfred]
Isn't there some way we can change him back?
[Corrupted] [Morion]
[Marth]
There's nothing we can do. The king you knew
is gone.
[Alfred]

[Alear]
No...
[Marth]
[Diamant]
...
We have to end this.
[Alear]



[Alcryst]
What are you saying, Brother?
[Diamant]
You think Father would want to live like this?
As this...abomination fighting for Hyacinth?
[Diamant] Serious
We have to let him die as the proud, noble man
he was. As the king of Brodia.

[Alcryst]
I don't know if I can do this...
[Diamant]

[Alear]
We must. We will free King Morion's soul...
and take down Hyacinth.

[Marth]
With that Emblem at his side, King Hyacinth will
be able to fire arrows from a great distance.
[Marth]
Let us proceed with caution.


[Alear]
There are so many of him! How is this possible?
[Marth]
He used the Emblem to create doubles. Careful.
We do not know what they're capable of.


--- MOVIE ---

[Hyacinth]
Haha... Lord Sombron!
[Sombron]
Hmm... It seems my powers have returned
because of you.
[Hyacinth]
It was an honor, my lord.
[Sombron]
And yet, I still hunger for more.
[Hyacinth]
Please, my lord, devour these fools.
[Sombron]
Hahaha... Alas, I have a different meal in mind.
[Hyacinth]
Huh?
[Sombron]
Only sovereign blood will quell my hunger.
You understand.
I want your blood...and I will take it!


--- BT ---

" [Rosado]
How dare you make Hortensia sad!

[Rosado]
You took me out just like Princess Ivy, huh?

$ [Goldmary]
I must insist now─please die.

" [Goldmary]
Ugh, I mustn't add to Hortensia's grief...
I'm much too precious to her...

$ [Hyacinth]
Tell me. How do you feel about the new
Brodian king?
$ [Hyacinth]
Relax
Once Lord Sombron drank his blood, we had no
need of him. But we corrupted him...for you.
$ Am I not generous? You can show your
gratitude by dying.

" [Hyacinth]
Please, no more! No more!

[Corrupted] * [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Morion]
RAAARGH!

[Corrupted] ( [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Morion]
RAAARGH!

[Alear]
King Morion.
You said you wanted to duel when we made it
back to the castle... Remember?
I wish we could have crossed swords as friends.
But now...we must face each other as enemies.

[Diamant]
This is our last sparring match, isn't it, Father?
When I was a boy, you taught me the meaning
of strength.
You'd make light of it, but you were preparing
me for when I'd have to fight my own battles.
That day has come. And you prepared me well.
Your life was devoted to protecting Brodia's
honor... Now I take on that mantle.
[Corrupted] * [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Morion]
Uraaargh!
[Diamant]
Was I a good son? I should have asked you
that sooner.
[Diamant] Serious
You instilled in me pride and strength. But most
importantly...you gave me your love.
I should have told you what that meant.



[Alcryst]
Father... If you have to die, let it be by my hand.
This would be an unbearable burden for
Diamant. So I... I must...
[Corrupted] * [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Morion]
Raaargh!

[Alcryst]
I must do this, Father!
If some part of you is still in there... Just...
Thank you for everything.
I love you. I always will.

[Corrupted]  [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Morion]
Raa...argh... Strong of body... Strong of heart...

 [Hortensia]
You took my sister from me! I'll never
forgive you!

 [Hortensia]
You! Dragon! You're the one who killed my
sister, aren't you?

[Alear]
No, Ivy is alive.
[Hortensia]
Then where is she?! If she's alive, prove it!

[Alear]
I don't know where she is.
 [Hortensia]
See, I knew it! You're lying! I'm going to make
you pay for what you did!

" [Hortensia]
Why do I always lose? Well, I won't let you
kill me...
