[Rosado] 
Hey, Mauvier!
[Mauvier] 
Rosado.
[Rosado] 
Are you always this, ah...tense?
[Mauvier] 
I do not intend to be.
[Rosado] 
Come on, relax! How can you stay grumpy 
looking at this cute face?
[Mauvier] 
Grumpy? Well, such is my life.
[Mauvier] 
As for "cute," I have little experience. Please see 
my reaction as uneducated, rather than rude.
[Rosado] 
Oh, that's it! I think I get it now!
[Mauvier] 
Get what?
[Rosado] 
You're uninitiated. You haven't developed your 
cute sense! No wonder you're a bit of a grump!
[Rosado] 
I can help with that. Let me teach you all about 
cuteness appreciation! Get you enjoying life!
[Mauvier] 
That is not necessary.
[Rosado] 
Are you kidding? It's top priority!
[Rosado] 
Not being able to feel cuteness is like...it's like 
not being able to taste the heat in a spicy stew!
[Mauvier] 
Hmm... I do appreciate a spicy stew. OK, then. 
Teach me about cuteness.
[Rosado] 
Yes! Leave it to me─you're gonna love this!

[Rosado] 
OK, look at this accessory case. Seems kind of 
ordinary, right? Wrong! Bunny ears!
[Rosado] 
Isn't that the most adorable thing you've 
ever seen?!
[Mauvier] 
I agree that it looks like a rabbit, yes.
[Rosado] 
OK...more straightforward. What about this 
handkerchief? It's got pretty summer flowers!
[Mauvier] 
Hmm... The embroidery is quite well done.
[Mauvier] 
But as for what is "cute" about it?
[Mauvier] 
I am sorry. I cannot see what it is you want me 
to see.
[Rosado] 
Hmm... You're a tough one, but I still think we 
can make headway. Let's get down to basics.
[Rosado] 
Think of a time in your life when your pulse 
was racing. When your heart fluttered!
[Mauvier] 
Fluttered?
[Rosado] 
You know... "Ah, it's so cute! I can't stand it! If 
I must look a moment longer, I fear I will die!"
[Rosado] 
Like that!
[Mauvier] 
Oh, I know.
[Mauvier] 
My heart did flutter when I was struck by an 
enemy's poisoned arrow.
[Rosado] 
There's nothing cute about poison...
[Mauvier] 
I am sorry. I do not think I can learn the ways 
of "cute."
[Mauvier] 
As a child, my education by worshippers of the 
Fell Dragon was a time of great suffering.
[Mauvier] 
Their brainwashing did not work, yet I was left 
with absolutely no connection to "cute."
[Mauvier] 
I do not believe I am capable of learning its 
meaning now.
[Rosado] 
Mauvier...don't give up.
[Mauvier] 
My apologies. I must be going.

[Rosado] 
Hi, Mauvier.
[Mauvier] 
Rosado. Have you come to lecture me again on 
"cute"? I thought I made my stance clear?
[Rosado] 
You did. And I know, my timing wasn't great.
[Rosado] 
I don't think someone as kind and focused as 
you can put the war aside until it's over.
[Mauvier] 
I am rather focused, yes. Lack of focus leads to 
defeat─in battle and in life.
[Mauvier] 
You have seen what I could not. If I had realized 
it myself, I could have spared you the trouble.
[Mauvier] 
For that, I apologize.
[Rosado] 
No, don't apologize! But if it's OK with you, 
I'd like us to make a promise to each other.
[Mauvier] 
What kind of promise?
[Rosado] 
Once the war is over, once there's peace, let's 
make it a point to broaden your horizons.
[Mauvier] 
Once there is peace, you say.
[Mauvier] 
Heh, you are a strange one.
[Mauvier] 
I think you would be more fulfilled if you spent 
your days with other people.
[Rosado] 
I'm not making this promise with them, though. 
I'm making it with you!
[Mauvier] 
I...appreciate that.
[Rosado] 
So can we call it a promise? We'll explore the 
cuteness of the world together in peacetime?
[Mauvier] 
If that would please you, then yes. We shall 
travel whenever you like.
[Mauvier] 
Together, we shall see "cute," and we will eat 
only the spiciest of stews.
[Rosado] 
Oh, uh... Right, spicy stews! Sure, whatever's 
fun for you─we'll do it!
[Mauvier] 
Heh, I look forward to it.
