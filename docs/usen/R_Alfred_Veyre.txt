[Veyle]
Ack...
[Alfred]
Lady Veyle!
[Veyle]
Oh, Alfred...
[Alfred]
You're drenched in sweat. Are you feeling OK?
[Veyle]
It's so, so spicy.
[Alfred]
What is?
[Veyle]
This soup I'm eating.
[Alfred]
Wait...is that all?!
[Alfred]
Haha! Hahaha!
[Veyle]
What's so funny?
[Alfred]
You just look so dead set on eating that soup,
no matter how spicy it is.
[Veyle]
It's my favorite, but I can't help making
a weird face every time I eat it.
[Veyle]
I know. How about you give it a try?
[Veyle]
It's so spicy you'll make a weird face too.
Just you wait and see!
[Alfred]
Challenge accepted!
[Alfred]
Eww...
[Alfred]
Hmm?
[Alfred]
AHH! HOT! Too hot! Need water NOW!
[Veyle]
Hehehe, see! Your face was way weirder than
mine. I win!

[Veyle]
Alfred, there's something I've been worried
about.
[Alfred]
Hmm, well... How about we go for a
run together?
[Veyle]
I don't understand. How will that help?
[Alfred]
Haha, when the sweat starts to drip and your
legs get sore, everything else melts away!
[Veyle]
So, I'm just supposed to...to forget about the
stuff that's worrying me?
[Alfred]
Sure! As long as that stuff's not bothering you
anymore, that's a good thing.
[Veyle]
Um, let me try again. I have worries that I
actually want to solve, not just forget about.
[Alfred]
Then tell me all about 'em.
[Veyle]
OK. Well, I want to find a way to be of help
to people once the war is over.
[Veyle]
I don't know exactly what to do yet, but...
[Veyle]
I wondered if I could ask you for help figuring
it out?
[Alfred]
Of course! I'm happy to do whatever I can.
[Veyle]
Oh, thank you! I knew you were the right person
to ask.
[Veyle]
But here's what worries me. Alfred, I did so
many bad things...before.
[Veyle]
I don't think anyone, except maybe the people
here, will accept my help.
[Alfred]
Yeah, could be. Lotta people out there don't
know the whole story with you.
[Alfred]
But that's OK. You can take all the time you
need to get folks to understand.
[Alfred]
I'll be there vouching for you every step of
the way.
[Alfred]
It's the least I can do for a good buddy.
[Veyle]
That's very kind of you.
[Alfred]
But I guess this doesn't go too far toward
solving your problems, huh?
[Alfred]
Maybe there's something more I can do
right now?
[Veyle]
No, it's OK. You've done so much for
me already.
[Veyle]
Thank you, Alfred.

[Veyle]
...
[Alfred]
Lady Veyle! You look like someone who could
stand to run some laps!
[Veyle]
Hehe, why do you say that?
[Alfred]
Because you've got that look on your face. The
one that says, "Things are unbelievably terrible."
[Veyle]
...
[Alfred]
Listen, some problems you just can't solve,
no matter how hard you wish you could.
[Alfred]
For those, you gotta get out there and run until
all you remember is the run.
[Veyle]
I don't know...
[Veyle]
How can I just forget?
[Veyle]
The terrible things I did... The pain I caused...
[Veyle]
My heart is so full of guilt, and I'm afraid I'm
going to feel like this forever.
[Alfred]
Hm.
[Alfred]
You know what? This sounds too tough to leave
behind, even with the help of a good run.
[Veyle]
Yes...I think you're right.
[Alfred]
So, every mile or two, try a few sets of
push-ups. That oughta do the trick.
[Veyle]
Um...
[Alfred]
And if you add some crunches, you'll be golden!
I guarantee you a good night's sleep after that.
[Veyle]
Crunches?
[Veyle]
Hehe!
[Veyle]
Oh, Alfred. I don't think my problems can be
solved by push-ups...or crunches.
[Alfred]
Of course. You know that, and I know that.
[Alfred]
You probably won't ever forget all that stuff
you told me about.
[Veyle]
No.
[Veyle]
I'll continue to shoulder this guilt and regret
for a long time...
[Alfred]
Maybe you will. But you've gotta give yourself
a break sometimes, right?
[Alfred]
If you don't set your troubles down every now
and then, they'll crush you.
[Veyle]
You're right, Alfred. Thank you so much.
[Veyle]
You know, I think I might want to go for a run.
[Veyle]
Will you come with me? Please?
[Alfred]
Just say the word.
[Alfred]
I'd be happy to push you so hard, you can't
think of anything else. It's what I do best!
