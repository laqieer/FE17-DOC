[Céline]
...


[Alcryst]
Princess Céline? You're up rather late.
Is something the matter?
[Céline]
Oh, Prince Alcryst.
[Céline]
It's nothing. My sleep was restless tonight,
that's all.
[Alcryst]
Ah. Did you have a bad dream?
[Céline]
...
[Céline]
I dreamt my brother died.
[Alcryst]
Oh...
[Céline]
This is a recurring dream, mind you. One that
I have had many times since childhood.
[Céline]
My brother used to be chronically ill, you see.
[Céline]
But even now, I can't shake the feeling that he
might be taken from me at any moment.
[Alcryst]
Oh, Princess Céline...
[Céline]
Alfred has recovered since then, make no
mistake. He is the picture of robust health now.
[Alcryst]
That he is. He always seems so brave on the
battlefield. It's amazing.
[Alcryst]
For what it's worth, I have those same bad
dreams myself...
[Alcryst]
Dreams where my brother Diamant is taken
from me, that is.
[Céline]
Oh! Do you now?
[Alcryst]
I do. They're a bit grim, so I've never discussed
them with anyone.
[Céline]
I see. I should like to hear more about them,
if you are willing.
[Céline]
But the hour is far too late for that, I think.
Another time, Prince Alcryst?
[Alcryst]
Of course. I'm free to talk whenever you need
a sympathetic ear.

[Céline]

[Alcryst]
Another bad dream, Princess Céline?
[Céline]
Hah... Is it so obvious?
[Céline]
As I recall, you've also had dreams of losing
your brother, haven't you?
[Céline]
I'm curious... When did they start for you?
[Alcryst]
Only recently, shortly after we entered this
war against the Fell Dragon.
[Alcryst]
My father told me, "If your brother and I both
die, it will fall to you to protect our kingdom."
[Alcryst]
I thought that sounded impossible at the time.
[Alcryst]
My mighty father and invincible older brother...
die in battle? How ridiculous.
[Alcryst]
But wars are often...unpredictable.
[Céline]
I know what you mean.
[Alcryst]
Now I'm haunted by a growing fear that my bad
dreams might become reality.
[Alcryst]
What if an enemy catches him off guard? What
if we're separated and I never find him again?
[Alcryst]
I've lost count of all the horrible ways my
dreams have taken Diamant from me...
[Céline]
My experience has been similar. In my dreams,
every disaster I can think of comes to pass.
[Alcryst]
Now, after every nightmare, I crawl out of bed
and check on him as he sleeps.
[Alcryst]
Seeing him sprawled out, snoring louder than
the sawing of a log... That puts my fears to rest.
[Céline]
I'm glad you have that, at least.
[Céline]
My brother is too much of an early riser for me
to do the same. I'd be roped into his workouts.
[Alcryst]
Heh... Funny, I'd imagine that seeing him up
and running in circles would be a relief.
[Céline]
Heh heh, it does help, I admit.
[Céline]
Well! Speaking with you has calmed my nerves.
I am sorry for worrying you.
[Alcryst]
Not at all. If you have another bad dream and
want to talk about it, I'm always here.
[Alcryst]
I can't make them go away, but...at the very
least, you know you're not alone.
[Céline]
Thank you, Prince Alcryst. I find that very
reassuring.

[Céline]
This tea has a lovely fragrance. And a stirring
taste, as well.
[Alcryst]
I agree! The tea leaves are from the Brodian
highlands. They're said to be a potent sleep aid.
[Céline]
Truly?
[Céline]
Oh... You prepared this just for me, didn't you?
I'm touched.
[Alcryst]
How have your dreams been lately?
[Céline]
No better, I'm afraid. As the war intensifies,
so too do my nightmares.
[Alcryst]
I'm so sorry to hear that.
[Alcryst]
...
[Alcryst]
You know...I don't think either of us will ever
rule our countries.
[Céline]
I beg your pardon?
[Alcryst]
Ah, that came out wrong. I meant that, should
the worst happen, we'd do our duties, but...
[Alcryst]
The worst isn't going to happen. We'll fight to
protect them─our brothers, our future kings.
[Alcryst]
Fear may persist in our dreams, but we won't
let it affect our realities.
[Alcryst]
In fact, I'll go a step further...and do my best to
protect Prince Alfred as well!
[Céline]
Oh!
[Alcryst]
He's the crown prince of an allied kingdom,
so I consider him to be my brother too.
[Alcryst]
Oh, wait... He might be annoyed if a weakling
like me were to offer protection as a brother.
[Céline]
Don't be silly! Alfred would be overjoyed.
I know I am. It's enough to bring me to tears.
[Céline]
It's very reassuring to know someone so skilled
as you will be watching over him.
[Alcryst]
Oh. I...appreciate that you think so highly of me.
[Céline]
I, in turn, will safeguard your brother, the
crown prince Diamant.
[Céline]
Working together to protect the future kings
will benefit both our nations.
[Céline]
I would go so far to risk my own life for them,
if needed.
[Alcryst]
Princess Céline! That's not─
[Céline]
It isn't the normal order of things. I am aware.
And yet...
[Céline]
I suspect you would do the same, yes?
[Alcryst]
Hm...
[Alcryst]
You're right of course, but...we should probably
keep this agreement a secret.
[Céline]
Yes, indeed.
[Alcryst]
I believe we just formed an alliance that would
worry most of our friends and allies.
[Céline]
Yet I think that because of it, my nightmares
will plague me less frequently.
[Alcryst]
I think that might be true for me as well.
[Alcryst]
We may never bear our own crowns, but we can
certainly bear each other's burdens.
[Céline]
Yes. Even after the war ends, may we always
act in harmony for the sake of our nations.
