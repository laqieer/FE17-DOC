[Kagetsu] 
Ah...hunger has struck. Perfect time for onigiri.
[Bunet] 
Kagetsu.
[Kagetsu] 
Oh! Bunet! How did you appear so suddenly?
[Bunet] 
Those little food triangles. Onigiri, you 
called them.
[Bunet] 
I've never seen one before. What are they 
made of?
[Kagetsu] 
Try one for yourself. Have mine.
[Bunet] 
Are you sure? Well, all right, then.
[Bunet] 
Mmm... It's delicious!
[Bunet] 
A ball of rice, lightly salted and wrapped in 
seaweed. And, and...um...grilled fish, yes?
[Kagetsu] 
Yes! Salted salmon!
[Bunet] 
I see. By all appearances, the simplest of foods, 
yet it contains hidden depths of flavor.
[Bunet] 
Please, teach me how to make this.
[Kagetsu] 
It would be my pleasure. However, I have 
obligations to Princess Ivy as her retainer.
[Kagetsu] 
If I set aside my duty to teach you onigiri, she 
will be displeased.
[Bunet] 
Ah. Disappointing, but I understand.
[Bunet] 
In that case, I will master the art of making 
onigiri on my own.
[Kagetsu] 
I admire your passion! Tell me when you are 
done, and I will provide your taste test.
[Bunet] 
Naturally. I will rely on you to judge whether 
I am capturing the food's essence.

[Bunet] 
Kagetsu! It is time.
[Kagetsu] 
What for?
[Bunet] 
Did you forget?
[Bunet] 
Since we last spoke, I have been absorbed in 
the art of making onigiri.
[Bunet] 
I experimented with ingredients, rice-density 
levels... For days, I thought of nothing else.
[Bunet] 
Finally, after all that toil, I made this.
[Kagetsu] 
Oooh... It looks very good.
[Kagetsu] 
But more important than how it looks is what it 
contains. Tell me the ingredients inside!
[Bunet] 
I used dates, harvested fresh from a date palm. 
Something of a Solmic specialty.
[Kagetsu] 
Date palm? That is eccentric. I do not know 
this ingredient.
[Bunet] 
Give it a try.
[Kagetsu] 
I will indeed!
[Kagetsu] 
Hm. Hm. Hmm...
[Kagetsu] 
Sweetness is unexpected for onigiri... But not 
unwelcome! The rice takes well to it.
[Bunet] 
Doesn't it? I went through much trial and error 
before landing on dates.
[Kagetsu] 
Yes, it is delicious! Very good. However...
[Kagetsu] 
It is flavored more like ohagi.
[Bunet] 
Like what?!
[Bunet] 
Are you saying that something like this 
already exists?
[Kagetsu] 
Yes! Ohagi is when sweet rice is rolled up and 
covered with red bean paste.
[Bunet] 
Oh...
[Bunet] 
So, in short...this is not an onigiri.
[Kagetsu] 
No, no! The shape is very accurate to onigiri!
[Bunet] 
But it tastes like an ohagi.
[Bunet] 
I appreciate your kind words, but I will not 
settle for missing the mark.
[Bunet] 
My culinary knowledge is lacking. Who knows 
how many dishes have escaped my notice?
[Bunet] 
Excuse me. I must go study.
[Kagetsu] 
Your onigiri was delicious, and yet you remain 
so eager to learn more...

[Kagetsu] 
I am curious, Bunet. What motivates you to 
learn so many new foods?
[Bunet] 
I wish to become a poet of the plate.
[Bunet] 
To me, that means expressing my vision with 
the broadest possible vocabulary of flavors.
[Bunet] 
I thought I was well on my way to fluency in all 
existing culinary languages, but alas...
[Bunet] 
I didn't even know...about ohagi.
[Kagetsu] 
...
[Kagetsu] 
We are very much alike, it seems.
[Bunet] 
What? How do you mean?
[Kagetsu] 
I left my home in search of knowledge about 
the world at large.
[Kagetsu] 
Seeking out strong opponents to fight has 
been my way to experience new horizons.
[Kagetsu] 
At Elusia Castle, I had my first encounter with 
true defeat. And that is when I realized...
[Kagetsu] 
The ones I fought there were very strong. But 
so many other strong ones await me still.
[Bunet] 
Hm. Our situations do seem similar.
[Bunet] 
You wish to become the world's best fighter, 
just as I wish to become the world's best chef.
[Kagetsu] 
I have been fortunate to become retainer to 
Princess Ivy. This position is teaching me much.
[Kagetsu] 
I am now able to see that it is not necessary 
for me to meet every strong opponent there is.
[Kagetsu] 
I cannot hope to know everything. What I can do 
is focus on mastering my own skill.
[Bunet] 
How wise. I wonder if I will ever be able to 
adopt your accepting attitude.
[Kagetsu] 
...
[Kagetsu] 
Bunet, I have decided. I will contribute to 
your path toward mastery.
[Kagetsu] 
If you wish it, I will tell you all that I know 
of cuisine in my culture.
[Kagetsu] 
Pale Sands lives in isolation, so there may be 
no other way for you to study it.
[Bunet] 
That sounds wonderful, but...you said you were 
busy with your retainer duties.
[Kagetsu] 
But you and I are friends. And I can always 
make time for friendship!
[Bunet] 
Thank you, Kagetsu.
[Bunet] 
I will pay you back in onigiri.
[Bunet] 
The proper kind this time. Made with salted fish 
and seaweed.
[Kagetsu] 
Yes, but be sure to include ones with dates 
as well. They were delicious too!
[Bunet] 
Hahaha, as you wish. Prepare to have your 
mouth water.
[Bunet] 
I am looking forward to learning more about 
your culture.
