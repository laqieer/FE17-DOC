=== Zelkov & Yunaka ===
--- C ---


[Yunaka]
Ugh, I'm not interested in playing your goofy
game, Zelkov. Just tell me what you're after.
[Zelkov]
Why, Yunaka, what *game* do you think
I am playing?
[Yunaka]
The stalking game, by the look of it. Don't act
like you don't know the rulebook backwards!
[Zelkov]
So you've noticed, have you? How *curious.*
[Zelkov]
You have the perceptive powers of a *hunter.*
Do you perchance hunt for sport...or for money?
[Yunaka]
...
[Zelkov]
At last, the truth is *written* on your face. I'd
suspected you made your trade in violence.
[Zelkov]
That is why I've *stalked* you, as you put it.
Suspicious persons ought to be observed.
[Yunaka]
...
[Yunaka]
OK, I'll admit it. You've got some chops.
[Yunaka]
Now, what say we rattle your brains around
a bit and see what shakes out?
[Zelkov]
Oh my. Be gentle.
[Yunaka]
You've got the same killer instinct I do.
It practically oozes from your pores. Like slime!
[Yunaka]
So, tell me. Have we had similar careers?
[Zelkov]
That does *appear* to be the case.
[Yunaka]
Great. Well, let's not speak of it again, OK?
[Yunaka]
My work is in the past. I'm happily retired.
[Zelkov]
I, too, have washed my *hands* of that life.
[Yunaka]
So we have that in common too, huh? Well, let's
not make a thing of it.
[Yunaka]
Look, here's me not making a thing. See ya.

[Zelkov]
About what we discussed *previously,*
Yunaka...
[Yunaka]
That's so weird! I told you not to make a thing
of it, and yet here you are. Making things.
[Zelkov]
That message was well received. I only wished
to discuss *one* more detail.
[Zelkov]
You said that a killer instinct *oozes* from my
pores. I believe you used the word "slime."
[Zelkov]
What did you mean by that?
[Yunaka]
...
[Zelkov]
Please. It is crucial to my *well-being* that I am
able to curate the image I present to others.
[Yunaka]
Fine.
[Yunaka]
Look. You're a hunter. Everything you do and
say is about the kill.
[Zelkov]
Could you indulge me with an *example*?
[Yunaka]
OK, sure. Take your eyes, for *example.*
They're ice cold. Calculating.
people don't go around evaluating what
folks' lives are worth. That's an assassin thing.
[Yunaka]
You're always probing for weaknesses too.
Considering vectors of attack, right?
[Zelkov]
That is *not* what I...
[Yunaka]
Seriously, bud? You're doing it right now!
[Yunaka]
Look at yourself. Tell me you're not poised to
counter a knife thrust from my dominant hand.
[Yunaka]
You're constantly positioning to maximize your
tactical advantage. Don't think I don't see it.
[Zelkov]
Perceptive...
[Yunaka]
Regular people don't think about violence so
much in everyday life. That's what I meant.
[Zelkov]
To think that I should be so *transparent*
to you...
[Yunaka]
Sharp eyes were part of the old job, as I'm sure
you know.
[Zelkov]
I appreciate your insightful analysis. I will
*reflect* on what you've said.
[Yunaka]
Yeah, don't mention it.

[Yunaka]
Heya, Zelkov. Would you mind if we talked
a teensy bit more about our trade?
[Zelkov]
Why the sudden change of *heart*? You were
quite clear that you didn't wish to discuss it.
[Yunaka]
Yeah, yeah. I know what I said. I was there the
whole time.
[Yunaka]
I was worried talking about it too much would
be...too much. But it hasn't been.
[Yunaka]
The opposite, actually. Talking about it's helped
me get distance. Perspective, y'know?
[Zelkov]
Care to elaborate?
[Yunaka]
Look, people like us don't often get the chance
to speak candidly. It could be a good thing.
[Zelkov]
Perhaps you're right. But even so, what is left
for us to *converse* about, exactly?
[Zelkov]
The story of how I came to such a profession
is not one I am *keen* to tell.
[Zelkov]
I'm afraid it's a rather tragic tale. Ill-suited for
any sort of *pleasant* conversation.
[Yunaka]
Yeah. Honestly, that whole chapter of my life
was pretty dang awful.
[Zelkov]
It was the same for me. Not even the most
difficult *challenges* we face today compare.
[Zelkov]
But I would venture to suppose that you did
not *choose* to embark upon a life of killing.
[Yunaka]
What makes you say that?
[Zelkov]
I get the sense, merely by observing, that you
genuinely have *no* regrets.
[Zelkov]
From this observation I inferred you may not
have been *responsible* for your circumstances.
[Yunaka]
Good inference...
[Zelkov]
Moreover, your present self was formed as a
*result* of growing apart from your past.
[Zelkov]
In a way, then...if you are the blossom, your
past is the fertilizer which *nourished* you.
[Yunaka]
That's...really insightful, actually. Thanks.
[Yunaka]
Words have weight, Zelkov, and every one
of yours is big and heavy.
[Yunaka]
But it's funny. Hearing them somehow makes
me feel lighter. Maybe it's our common bond.
[Zelkov]
You flatter me.
[Yunaka]
I've been thinking about what I'll do when all
this is over. When the world's finally peaceful.
[Yunaka]
What I want most is to go someplace where
I can kick back. Put my feet up. Luxuriate!
[Zelkov]
I will say that does *sound* lovely.
[Yunaka]
If and when that happens, I hope you'll drop in
on me once in a while.
[Zelkov]
I would gladly make an appearance. There will
be conversations *only* you and I can have.
[Yunaka]
Ooo, yes! Love it! We'll do each other's hair,
trade weapon factoids. Whatever we want!
[Zelkov]
Indeed... Let us work toward that eventuality
as our *common* goal from now on.
[Yunaka]
It's a promise, then. If we've got the same dark
past, we may as well share a bright future.
