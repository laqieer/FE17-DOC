=== Amber & Jade ===

[Jade]
Amber, may I ask you a few personal questions?
I need some new material for my next novel.
[Amber]
Oh! You're gonna write a book about me?
Oh man! I love that! Fire away.
[Jade]
I'll start with an easy one. What's your all-time
favorite thing?
[Amber]
Is that a serious question? Come on! Alpacas all
the way! They're the best.
[Amber]
I used to herd alpacas all the time back home.
I'm like an alpaca-wrangling master, y'know?
[Jade]
"Alpaca-wrangling master." Amazing.
[Amber]
I'm serious! If there was an alpaca here right
now, I'd give you a demonstration.
[Amber]
But we're miles away from the nearest alpaca
farm, so...
[Jade]
Wait. What is that sound?
[Amber]
That's the sound of an alpaca at full gallop! Ah!
[Jade]
You're right! I can see it now, and it's coming
this way!
[Amber]
OK, Jade! You wanted material, you're gonna
get it. Watch the wrangling master in action.
[Amber]
Hey! Alpaca! Slow it down, buddy!
[Amber]
Whoa, there! I said settle down!
[Amber]
AUGH! Waaaaaah!
[Jade]
Amber!

[Amber]
Ugh... Getting knocked into a pond wasn't what
I wanted to show you.
[Jade]
I can't believe an alpaca came out of nowhere
like that. I'm just glad we were able to catch it.
[Amber]
You mean YOU caught it. All I managed to
catch was a mouthful of scummy water.
[Amber]
I can't even compete with you at something
I'm genuinely good at...
[Amber]
Ngh...
[Jade]
Amber, don't despair. There is a silver lining.
[Jade]
The alpaca, the pond, your flailing... Thanks to
you, my next book is sure to be hilarious.

[Jade]
Hey, Amber. I'm still a few chapters short. May
I ask you some more questions?
[Amber]
Hang on, Jade. First, I have a request for you.
[Amber]
Please, please don't write about how I
completely failed to catch that alpaca!
[Jade]
Wha─
[Amber]
My hometown is known for its alpaca expertise.
I can't throw that kind of shame on them!
[Amber]
I was so bogged down by emotions and pond
water that I failed to ask before. So...pleeease?
[Jade]
This comes as a bit of a shock. I won't make
you a promise that I can't keep, Amber.
[Jade]
You've inspired my funniest, most successful
works. People are excited for the next one...
[Amber]
OK, then...
[Amber]
Let's spar. If I win, you can't write anything
about the alpaca-puddle incident!
[Jade]
Fine by me. You're on.
[Amber]
This will be our first sparring match since the
tourney to select Prince Diamant's retainers...
[Amber]
That was also the first time I lost to you.
I've been stuck in second place ever since.
[Amber]
That loss was like a curse. No matter what I do,
I can't seem to beat you at anything.
[Jade]
Well, you did enter the final round of that
tournament at a disadvantage.
[Jade]
You didn't have any time to warm up. You were
too busy trying to help that lost child.
[Amber]
That's no excuse! You ended up helping too.
You even found the kid's parents first.
[Jade]
Hmm, I take your point.
[Amber]
You're the one who's always finding success,
and I'm the one who's always tripping up.
[Amber]
That runaway alpaca was the last straw.
My second-place streak ends today!
[Amber]
Get ready, Jade. There's no way I'm losing to
you again.

[Jade]
Had enough?
[Amber]
Aw... I just can't do it. I really can't beat you,
Jade. It's...it's hopeless...
[Jade]
You remember our terms? I won, so I'm free to
put whatever I want in my next novel.
[Amber]
Yeah, I remember. You beat me fair and square,
so...write about whatever you want.
[Jade]
That's just what I'm going to do. But I'll make
sure you're the first to read it when I'm done.

[Jade]
My novel is complete, Amber. As I mentioned
earlier, I'd like for you to be the first to read it.
[Amber]
Oh, great...
[Amber]
You really know how to rub it in, y'know? Fine.
Let's see how embarrassed I'm gonna be...
[Amber]
Hmm... Hmm!
[Amber]
Jade...what is this?
[Jade]
Hm.
[Amber]
Is this... Is this book still based on me?
[Jade]
Of course. Everything in that book is based on
something you've shared with me.
[Amber]
But where's the alpaca-pond incident?
[Amber]
I can't find a single embarrassing page in here.
This book makes me seem so...so cool!
[Jade]
You're not stuck in second place, Amber.
[Jade]
You were the first one to try stopping that
stray alpaca.
[Jade]
You were the first one to go looking for that
lost child's parents at the fighting tournament.
[Jade]
I may be the one who closes the book each
time, but only after you've opened it for me.
[Amber]
Whoa.
[Jade]
You're kind. You're strong. And both Prince
Diamant and I trust in you as a worthy retainer.
[Amber]
...
[Amber]
Aw, Jade! Thank you! Your kind words...
This great book... I feel so much better.
[Jade]
I'm glad. After all, you need to have confidence
if you're going to watch our backs in battle.
[Amber]
Yeah... Yeah! That settles it. I'm gonna keep
training until I match the "me" in your book.
[Jade]
Oh, I'm very excited to watch you try.
[Amber]
OK, no more coasting. It's time to train like I've
never trained before!
[Amber]
I'm gonna─ Gah! A rock?! Waaaugh!
[Jade]
...
[Jade]
Hm! Amazing. Looks like your training is off
to a "rocky start."
[Jade]
I have no doubt you'll grow stronger, Amber...
but I hope some things about you never change.
