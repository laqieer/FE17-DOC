[Merrin] 
All right. It's time for our daily singing practice.
[Merrin] 
Today we'll run through the princess's latest 
composition, "Expect a Trifecta."
[Merrin] 
We need to have it performance-ready in time 
for our next rehearsal with her.
[Panette] 
Performance-ready, you say...
[Merrin] 
Uh, yes. Something wrong? You seem down.
[Panette] 
In truth, I am. I overheard something that 
bothered me greatly.
[Merrin] 
Uh-oh. What was it?
[Panette] 
Someone called us the Racket of Solm.
[Merrin] 
Oh.
[Merrin] 
The "Racket" is our singing voices, I take it.
[Panette] 
That was my understanding as well.
[Merrin] 
Ouch.
[Merrin] 
Well, growing up, people always told me I was 
a terrible singer.
[Merrin] 
But the princess praised my singing voice as 
unique, so... Guess I thought I improved.
[Panette] 
It was the same for me, to the letter.
[Merrin] 
Ugh. Suddenly it seems like we've got our work 
cut out for us.
[Panette] 
Perchance we should sing more...quietly?
[Merrin] 
That might be a good idea.
[Panette] 
Then let us begin posthaste. A one, a two, 
a one, two, three...

[Merrin] 
Hey. What's the scuttlebutt?
[Panette] 
The what?
[Merrin] 
You know, our singing practice the other day. 
Were there any complaints?
[Panette] 
Ah, no reason to fret. I have heard nary an 
ill word.
[Merrin] 
Phew. I was worried about that.
[Merrin] 
Wait.
[Merrin] 
No. This is all wrong.
[Panette] 
What do you mean?
[Merrin] 
Singing quietly so nobody calls us names? 
Surely we can aim higher than that!
[Merrin] 
There's no escaping it. We have to get better 
at singing.
[Panette] 
Yes. Quite right.
[Panette] 
To hide our voices in shame... We sully the good 
name Timerra!
[Panette] 
If the boss learned of this, she would weep 
with embarrassment.
[Merrin] 
No, no. I couldn't live with myself if I made the 
princess cry.
[Panette] 
Nor I!
[Panette] 
The question is, how to improve? Hm...
[Merrin] 
Maybe we should ask the princess for advice.
[Panette] 
You think so?
[Merrin] 
But this time, we get serious feedback. None of 
that "unique" wolfdung.
[Panette] 
A grand idea! By all means, let us press for the 
full, unvarnished truth.

[Merrin] 
The princess's singing advice proved a bit, 
uh...challenging.
[Panette] 
Indeed.
[Merrin] 
"Merrin, take all that oomph and hold it right 
under your belly button!"
[Panette] 
Mystifying. What is "oomph," and how does one 
"hold" it?
[Merrin] 
The funny thing is, I kinda get it now.
[Merrin] 
When I focus on the spot right below my navel, 
my singing voice does get steadier.
[Panette] 
Though her counsel was nigh inscrutable, you 
followed it well! Commendable.
[Merrin] 
Haha! Thanks, Panette. And remind me, what 
was it the princess told you?
[Panette] 
She said, "You're at a WA-WA-WA. I need you at 
a dee-dee-dee!"
[Panette] 
I was dizzy with confusion. Dizzy, I say.
[Panette] 
But when I tried to put her advice into action, 
something unthinkable happened.
[Panette] 
It worked!
[Merrin] 
Perfect! Now no one will even think to call us 
the Racket of Solm.
[Panette] 
Certainly not. All across the queendom, we will 
put smiles on faces.
[Merrin] 
Instead of holes in eardrums!
[Panette] 
At this rate, we may soon be ready to put on 
a concert.
[Merrin] 
A concert, huh?
[Panette] 
Our listeners will be so mesmerized that they'll 
call us...the Sirens of Solm!
[Merrin] 
Ooo, that would be incredible! I want people to 
call me a siren.
[Panette] 
Now I'm all aquiver! Let us resume practicing 
tout suite!
[Merrin] 
I agree. We have to get "Expect a Trifecta" 
ready for showtime.
[Panette] 
Yes. We'll combine our voices into an angelic 
harmony that does the boss proud!
