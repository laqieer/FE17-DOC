[Etie] 
Another delicious-looking spread for dinner.
[Etie] 
Ooo, and they've got baked potatoes tonight. 
Lucky for me there's still one left.
[Etie] 
Gotta get my starches in, after all!
[Etie] 
Feels like everything's going my way.
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Oh! I'm going to step in here. Excuse me.
[Etie] 
Did you just... That baked potato was mine!
[Goldmary] 
Then you should have taken it instead of 
staring at it.
[Etie] 
Ugh! This is just the kind of thing I'd expect 
an Elusian to do.
[Goldmary] 
Only when there are Firenese in the way.
[Etie] 
I don't think you want to push this with me, 
lady. Hand over the baked potato.
[Goldmary] 
Respectfully, I decline.
[Etie] 
You "decline"? That's a fine thing to say for 
a potato thief!
[Goldmary] 
I can't steal what wasn't yours to begin with. 
Any authority figure would agree.
[Etie] 
That's it. No more talk. Gimme that potato!
[Goldmary] 
Mmm... No.
[Etie] 
You can't just eat it!
[Goldmary] 
Delicious. Mm.
[Goldmary] 
Sorry, I got distracted for a moment there. 
What were you saying?
[Etie] 
Urgh! Have it your way! But don't think this 
is over─you're gonna pay!

[Etie] 
Hey, you Elusian weirdo. We gotta talk.
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, I must have misheard you. Who are 
we talking about?
[Etie] 
You heard me just fine.
[Etie] 
What possessed you to spend three hours 
before battle polishing silverware?
[Goldmary] 
I don't see how that's any of your business.
[Goldmary] 
But since we're asking questions, indulge me. 
What's the point of your excessive exercise?
[Etie] 
What kind of question is that?!
[Etie] 
We're at war! Silverware doesn't keep you alive 
in battle. Muscle does.
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, what?
[Etie] 
Do you think your perfectly folded clothes are 
going to help you put a dent in the Corrupted?
[Goldmary] 
Excuse me, what? What?
[Etie] 
Quit it with the "whats"!
[Goldmary] 
Are you actually implying that I'm not in 
condition to survive a battle?
[Goldmary] 
If that's what you think, I'm going to have to 
ask you to get out of my face.
[Etie] 
What did you say?!
[Goldmary] 
You are looking at the very picture of elegance 
and grace. My condition defines pristine.
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if all your pointless sweating has 
drained away your aesthetic taste.
[Etie] 
Ugh! What's wrong with you?!
[Goldmary] 
I was about to ask you the same thing.

[Goldmary] 
Hello, Etie. Thanks for meeting with me. 
I was hoping we could talk.
[Etie] 
I don't know why you called me here, but it 
had better be good.
[Goldmary] 
This may sound a little peculiar, but would you 
mind giving me your hands?
[Etie] 
What for?
[Goldmary] 
I said some unfair things to you. Perhaps if I can 
feel your strength, I will learn to appreciate it.
[Goldmary] 
So, if you don't mind, I'd like to see how your 
hands feel. I'll put out the light so you can relax.
[Etie] 
Uhh... Sure, I guess.
[Goldmary] 
You really are strong. I can tell by the calluses 
how devoted you are to honing that strength.
[Etie] 
Well...yeah.
[Goldmary] 
Seeing how your dedication shapes who you are 
has helped me understand. Thank you.
[Goldmary] 
Here─take my hands, if you'd like. Maybe 
you'll understand who I am a little better.
[Etie] 
Does that work?
[Goldmary] 
Only one way to find out.
[Etie] 
Whoa! Is your skin seriously this smooth?
[Goldmary] 
Of course.
[Etie] 
I've never felt anything like this. You must put 
in some real effort to get it that way.
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry for asking this of you so suddenly. 
I know it's an odd way to get to know someone.
[Etie] 
Hehe, a little. But I learned more about you 
than I thought.
[Etie] 
You showed me there's more to life than being 
ready for war. I have to be ready for peace too.
[Goldmary] 
You see?
[Goldmary] 
Perhaps we can learn from one another after all.
[Goldmary] 
I'd be happy to give you advice on elegance 
in exchange for tips on my exercise routine.
[Etie] 
Sure! I love coaching people.
[Etie] 
Between you and me, a big part of this is 
protein powder. I'll set some aside for you.
[Goldmary] 
That sounds wonderful. If you'd like a lotion 
for your hands, I know several good ones.
[Etie] 
Haha, look at us. It didn't take much for us to 
start getting along, huh?
[Etie] 
Maybe I should actually thank you for swiping 
that last baked potato.
[Goldmary] 
No need to thank me for that. I was stealing, 
after all.
[Goldmary] 
I'm looking forward to learning from you, Etie. 
I hope you feel the same.
