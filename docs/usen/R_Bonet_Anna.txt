[Anna]
HIYAH!

[Bunet]
Hm. Nice chopping.
[Bunet]
The pieces of wood are perfectly equal. Really,
I respect the artistry.
[Anna]
Hehe! Glad you noticed. I am pretty good at
chopping wood, it's true.
[Anna]
I use it as raw material for woodworking or
whittling, which I then sell to folks.
[Bunet]
...
[Bunet]
Anna, I have a favor to ask.
[Anna]
Oh, please. We're friendly enough that you can
call me Lady Anna.
[Bunet]
Haha. Lady Anna, might I have some of
this timber?
[Anna]
Hmm, that's an idea. Are you also into
woodworking?
[Bunet]
Oh, no. It's not for me. It's for my stove.
[Bunet]
With such uniform pieces of firewood, it would
be easier to precisely control the temperature.
[Bunet]
In other words...my cooking would be elevated
to the next level.
[Bunet]
Give them to me...please?
[Anna]
Is that how that works? Well, if you feel that
strongly about it, we could work something out.
[Anna]
You'll have to pay, of course. I don't give
anything away for free.
[Bunet]
Heh, you are a shrewd one.
[Anna]
I've gotta be if I'm gonna make it on my own.
[Bunet]
I will pay you your due. The firewood is worth
any expense.

[Anna]
HIYAH!

[Bunet]
Nice chopping. Again.
[Anna]
Let me guess... You're here for more wood?
[Bunet]
Indeed I am.
[Bunet]
This timber of yours burns so evenly,
it's perfect for controlling stove heat.
[Bunet]
The risotto I cooked with it yesterday...
Flawless, even by my standards.
[Anna]
Great! Always nice to hear about a satisfied
customer.
[Bunet]
Lady Anna, I have to ask. How did you get so
good at chopping wood?
[Anna]
Hmm...
[Anna]
It's probably because it was one of my chores
when I lived at home with my family.
[Bunet]
I see. You've had to work hard all your life, hm?
[Anna]
Now you've got me thinking about my family.
That salmon stew we'd share was so good.
[Anna]
Ugh...
[Bunet]
Um... Is something wrong?
[Anna]
Nah, everything's peachy. Stand back and
watch the master woodcutter at work!
[Bunet]
Hmm...

[Anna]
HIYAH!
[Anna]
Hmm... That last stroke felt a little off. Weird.
[Anna]
...
[Anna]
I miss them all so much...

[Bunet]
Hello, Lady Anna. You seem to be hard at work.
[Anna]
Oh... Hey, Bunet.
[Anna]
I don't think you'll want the wood I chopped
today. My form is way off.
[Bunet]
I didn't come for firewood today.
[Bunet]
Here. I made you a salmon stew. I hope it's
like what you remember.
[Anna]
Oh, wow! Can I eat it now?!
[Bunet]
Yes, please do. While it's warm.
[Anna]
Thanks a bunch!
[Anna]
...
[Anna]
Mmm! That warms me right to my bones.
It tastes just like my family stew too.
[Bunet]
I'm glad. It took some doing.
[Bunet]
I had to research your hometown's cuisine and
then seek out all the right spices.
[Bunet]
I wasn't confident that I had nailed down
the flavor...
[Anna]
So that's why it tastes like home. Aww, you did
all that for me? I'm really touched!
[Anna]
I was getting so homesick that it was messing
up my woodcutting.
[Anna]
But that little taste of home cheered me right
up again! I'm ready to split a hundred logs!
[Bunet]
If you ever feel homesick, come talk to me.
I can at least take your taste buds back there.
[Anna]
I appreciate it. So how much do I owe you
for the stew?
[Bunet]
No need to pay. I meant it as a token of thanks.
[Anna]
Oh no! That's not going to work for me.
[Anna]
If I start taking charity, how am I supposed to
sell you any more wood?
[Bunet]
Ha... You really are shrewd.
[Bunet]
In that case, pay me in firewood. However much
you think that stew is worth.
[Anna]
Deal! I'll even throw in extra as an introductory
offer. Nice doing business with you!
