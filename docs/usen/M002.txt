[Lumera] 
Here we are. We are safe within these walls.
[Alear] 
So this is Lythos Castle. It's beautiful.
[Lumera] 
I'm glad you think so, .
Though you may not remember this place, I've 
long waited to welcome you back here.
Welcome home, .
[Alear] 
...
I'm home?
[Lumera] 
Yes, you are.
Ah, I feel overwhelmed with joy. I may cry.
[Vander] 3 
[Clanne] 4 
[Framme] 2 

[Vander] 
Queen Lumera...
[Lumera] 
Vander. Clanne. Framme. Thank you for all 
you've done. You are worthy stewards indeed.
You and your predecessors, watching over my 
child all these years... I am ever so grateful.
[Vander] 
You are too kind.
[Clanne] 
Yeah, it's awful nice of you to say that! 
I'm starting to feel woozy...
[Framme] 
Aw yeah! Go us! We just got praised by Queen 
Lumera herself!
[Vander] 
[Clanne] 
[Framme] 

[Lumera] 
The happiness of this moment aside, I am 
troubled to see the Corrupted here in Lythos.
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
The Corrupted?
[Lumera] 
Those enemies you were fighting out on 
the grasslands.
[Alear] 
Oh, I didn't like those things one bit. Just the 
sight of them made my blood run cold.
[Lumera] 
Understandably so. The Corrupted are corpses 
revived by an evil power.
The Fell Dragon used them as his soldiers in 
the war.
Before the start of that bitter conflict, Elyos had 
known peace for eons.
But then a dark presence emerged─Sombron.

Despite tireless searching, we could not 
determine where he'd come from.
But seeing the destruction he wrought, there 
was no doubt of his evil intentions.
Now the Corrupted are spreading once more. 
This may be a sign of his return.
[Alear] 
No...
[Lumera] 
I wonder if it is mere coincidence that you 
awakened as all this unfolds...
If the Fell Dragon has been released, then we 
must prepare for battle.
[Alear] 
I can't imagine fighting someone like that.
[Lumera] 
Worry not. I doubt he will attack anytime soon.
This castle is filled with the spirits of Divine 
Dragons─the Corrupted cannot enter it easily.
Let us devise a plan now, while we have 
the opportunity.
Emblem Marth.
[Marth] 4 
[Marth] 
It's been quite some time, Lumera.
[Lumera] 
That it has. Thank you for lending your aid 
against the Corrupted.
[Marth] 
You're welcome. But of course, I could help 
only because your child remembered me.
You know, it is possible the others are awake 
now, just as I am.
[Lumera] 
Perhaps you are right.
[Alear] 
Sorry, but... What do you mean? Who's awake?
[Lumera] 
There is something I should show you. 
Follow me.

[Lumera] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
What is this place?
[Lumera] 
This is the Ring Vault. It is where the Emblem 
Rings are enshrined.
Those of the Holy Knight, of the Sage Lord, 
and of the Azure Twins rest here.
As well as the Ring of the Princess Exalt and, 
finally, the Ring of the Instructor.
Each dwells within an Emblem Ring, as Marth 
resides in the Ring of the Hero-King.
[Alear] 
So, counting Marth, there are six Emblem 
Rings. Wow.
[Lumera] 
In fact, there are twelve─six here, and six 
entrusted to the other countries.
As a precautionary measure.
[Alear] 
What do you mean?
[Lumera] 
The Emblems grant world-altering power to 
whoever has all 12 rings.
For generations, the Divine Dragons used this 
power to ensure peace and prosperity in Elyos.
Indeed, that was how we locked away the 
Fell Dragon.
But many have sought to steal the rings and use 
them for their own nefarious purposes.
[Alear] 
Which is why they're scattered all over the 
continent, not just stored here.
[Lumera] 
Precisely. The rings offer their power but once 
every thousand years.
At which time the Divine Dragon travels across 
Elyos to collect them from each nation's ruler.
With a thousand years having passed since last 
time, I was planning to carry out this ritual soon.
But if the Fell Dragon is after the rings, the 
Emblems may be summoned before I arrive...
[Alear] 
"Summoned"?
[Lumera] 
It is how one calls for an Emblem from a ring. 
Just as you did earlier with Marth.
Only those with royal dragon blood are capable 
of summoning. That includes you, my child.
[Alear] 
Oh... You must be talking about the phrase that 
popped into my head.
[Lumera] 
An invocation, you mean? What was it?
[Alear] 
"Shine on, Emblem of Beginnings."
I wasn't even thinking about it. The words just... 
fell from my mouth.
[Lumera] 
That was how you summoned Marth.
...
What was your focus─your intention─when you 
spoke those words?
[Alear] 
I wanted to help Clanne and Framme.
I didn't want to lose them. I wanted to 
protect them.
[Lumera] 
Your focus was on helping others. Remember 
that intention whenever you summon Emblems.
Not to keep the power for yourself, understand? 
To borrow so you may protect others.
[Alear] 
I understand.
[Lumera] 
Now, why don't we try a practice battle? You 
must be a little rusty after all these years.

[Lumera] 2 
[Alear] 1 

[Lumera] 
How about we train here? You will be the one 
fighting. The Emblem lends you their strength.
You need to train your body and mind to 
unleash an Emblem's full power.
Vander, Clanne, Framme. You will be aiding my 
child in this battle...against me.
[Vander] 3 

[Vander] 
Queen Lumera, even in a practice battle, I could 
not turn my weapon on you.
[Lumera] 
Oh, Vander... Please do put your heart into it. 
I know I will.

[Lumera] 2 
[Alear] 1 

[Alear] 
The Corrupted?!
[Lumera] 
No, dear. Not at all. How could you think so? 
I made these opponents from plants and rocks.
Nevertheless, their abilities are the same. 
Drop your guard and you could be hurt.
[Alear] 
They're really unsettling. Can we train with 
something else? They give me the chills.
[Lumera] 
Listen. You must push through your fear and 
face whatever opponent stands against you.
Never run away. You are my child, the protector 
of all─the Divine Dragon .
[Alear] 
I understand.
[Framme] 3 
[Framme] 
Don't worry, Divine One! We'll back you up 
every step of the way.
[Framme] 
[Clanne] 3 
[Clanne] 
Yeah! What Framme said!
[Clanne] 

[Vander] 3 

[Vander] 
As loath as I am to battle against Queen 
Lumera...orders are orders.
I pledge to bring us victory.
[Alear] 
Thank you, everyone.
[Lumera] 
Now, let's begin.

[Lumera] [Lumera] Appeal 
Well fought, everyone. You bested Sigurd 
and me. That's quite the feat.
There is much to improve upon, but this is a 
wonderful start. Great work, .
[Alear] 
Thank you.
[Framme] 4 
[Framme] 
I can't believe we had to fight against 
Queen Lumera.
[Framme] 
[Clanne] 4 
[Clanne] 
Yeah, well, I can't believe we won.
[Clanne] 

[Vander] 4 

[Vander] 
Though you have only just awoken, your power 
seems to be growing already, Divine One.
[Vander] 

[Lumera] 
I'd like for you to have this, .
[Alear] 
This is the sword you were using, isn't it?
[Lumera] 
Yes─an ancient blade that can be wielded only 
by Divine Dragons.
It served me well for many years, but now it is 
yours. Consider it a prize for your victory today.
[Alear] 
Thank you. Someday I'll prove that I'm worthy 
of this sword.
[Lumera] 
I have no doubt.
Please, take this as well.
[Alear] 
Is this another Emblem Ring?
[Lumera] 
No, it is purely ornamental. You see, before 
your slumber, I made you a promise.
[Alear] 
What was it?
[Lumera] 
I said I'd give you a birthday present that suited 
you perfectly.
I was working on it in private, but I was unable 
to finish it in time...
That birthday has long since passed, but I 
would quite like to give you this gift now.
[Alear] 
I'm sorry... I can't accept.
[Lumera] 
Why not?
[Alear] 
That ring fulfills a promise you made me, right? 
But I don't remember that promise.
It'd feel wrong accepting it─like I was taking a 
present meant for someone else.
Please offer me this gift again once I've 
remembered everything.
[Lumera] 
Everything, you say.
...
Did facing me in battle stir any 
recollections, ?
[Alear] 
It didn't. I'm sorry.
[Lumera] 
You need not apologize. It doesn't matter what 
you can remember right now...
I only hope that one day, you will think of me 
as your mother.
As you did a thousand years ago.
[Alear] 
...
[Lumera] 
Forgive me. I was so thrilled to spend time with 
you again.
I suppose I got a little carried away, didn't I?
[Alear] 
Oh, no. It's all right.
[Lumera] 
Haha, I don't mean to put you on the spot. 
Perhaps we should call it a day, hm?
But let's agree to chat again in the morning.
What do you say? Pinky promise?
[Alear] 
Haha, all right.

[Lumera] 1 

[Lumera] 
Haha!
How wonderful to see my child awake at last. 
Now, we'll never have to be apart.
There is so much to catch up on. So much to 
see and do together!
We can chat for hours, take long walks, 
share meals. And then...
If my child's memories are truly lost, I wonder...
...
Emblem Sigurd.
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I am here.
[Lumera] 
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Today certainly was eventful.
Queen Lumera seems so kind and caring. 
I'm sure she was a wonderful mother.
If only I could remember those days.
I must have felt so lucky to be her child...

Be cautious, Divine One. Some of these enemies 
are carrying long-range weapons.
Therefore, they can rain arrows upon us 
from afar.

[Lumera] 
See this enemy with the axe? Axe-wielders are 
at a disadvantage against swords.
Swords are strong against axes. Axes, against 
lances. And then lances, against swords.
If you outmatch your foe, you can break their 
fighting stance─for an advantage in combat.
[Lumera] 
Relax 
Try it! Strike with your sword. After their stance 
is broken, they'll be open to further attack.

Enemies can't counterattack while recovering 
their stance. A good time to finish them off.

Each Emblem has their own abilities.
When allied with them, you can call upon their 
unique powers and skills.

Whatever Sigurd's power is, it won't be the 
same as Marth's.
We'd better keep our eyes open.
