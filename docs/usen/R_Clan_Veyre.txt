[Veyle] 
Hello, Clanne. What do you have there?
[Clanne] 
Oh, Lady Veyle. I'm pickling.
[Veyle] 
Pickling? What is that? I've never heard of it.
[Clanne] 
Pickling is preserving meats or vegetables in 
vinegar. Add spices, and they're very tasty.
[Clanne] 
I'm developing a new recipe at the moment. 
Would you care to try one?
[Veyle] 
Oh yes, I'd like that very much!
[Veyle] 
Hmm...
[Clanne] 
I think my pickles are pretty great, don't you?
[Veyle] 
Hmm. The taste is quite...plain.
[Clanne] 
What?
[Clanne] 
I mean... Um... You really think so? I think this 
batch is nicely sour, myself.
[Veyle] 
It just isn't very...potent. You should add 
a bunch of peppers.
[Clanne] 
You can't make pickles with peppers.
[Veyle] 
Are you sure about that?
[Veyle] 
I mean, is this really all a pickle can be?
[Clanne] 
Huh?
[Veyle] 
How will you ever create a new pickle recipe 
if you've already decided how pickles taste?
[Clanne] 
I... OK. Yeah. I guess you're right.
[Clanne] 
I've just been following the same old pickle 
routine without even questioning it.
[Clanne] 
I must try something new if I'm ever to grow as 
a pickle chef.
[Clanne] 
Lady Veyle, you've opened my eyes!
[Veyle] 
That's the spirit! Now, why don't you put 
some peppers in those pickles?
[Clanne] 
I think I'll do just that!

[Veyle] 
Oh, hello, Clanne. Did you get a chance to make 
those peppery pickles yet?
[Clanne] 
Well...yes? I'm sort of nervous about how bright 
red the brine is turning, though.
[Veyle] 
It'll be all right. I'm sure they're going to be 
so tasty. I can't wait to try them.
[Clanne] 
Oh...
[Veyle] 
What's wrong? You got so quiet all of a sudden.
[Clanne] 
It just sort of struck me that you remind me of 
my sister.
[Veyle] 
Your sister? Why do you say that?
[Clanne] 
You said things would work out, even though 
you've got no proof. She does that all the time.
[Veyle] 
That's a rude thing to say.
[Clanne] 
Ah! I'm sorry!
[Veyle] 
It's OK.
[Veyle] 
You and your sister are twins, right?
[Clanne] 
Mm-hmm! I'm the older one.
[Veyle] 
I wonder what having a sibling around is like...
[Clanne] 
Wh-what do you mean?
[Veyle] 
I mean, I was apart from my sibling for so long, 
I feel like I don't know what it's like. Not really.
[Veyle] 
It's hard to make up for all the lost time. I guess 
I don't know how to act like...family.
[Veyle] 
To be honest, I'm jealous of you. You get to 
spend so much time with your sister.
[Clanne] 
...
[Clanne] 
I think having a sibling is like... I guess sisters, 
and probably brothers, are like air.
[Veyle] 
What do you mean?
[Clanne] 
You take air for granted but you'd miss it a lot if 
it went away. I don't know if that makes sense.
[Veyle] 
Yes, I think I understand.
[Veyle] 
I would like to be thatâ”€a sister who's like air 
to someone.
[Clanne] 
You can totally be that.
[Clanne] 
Family is family. It doesn't matter how far apart 
you live, you're somebody's air.
[Veyle] 
Thank you, Clanne. I really needed to hear that.

[Clanne] 
Lady Veyle, the hot pepper pickles are 
finally ready!
[Veyle] 
Oooh, exciting! Can I give them a try?
[Clanne] 
Well, they look terrifyingly spicy, but, um, sure. 
Grab one and try it out!
[Veyle] 
...
[Clanne] 
Lady Veyle! Are you OK?! Should I call for help?
[Veyle] 
It's so...
[Clanne] 
Oh gosh, oh geez, oh no! I'll go get help!
[Veyle] 
I... I'm all right.
[Veyle] 
It's just so incredibly good!
[Veyle] 
I could go on eating these pickles forever!
[Clanne] 
You look like you're in so much pain. Are you 
OK? You can tell me.
[Veyle] 
Ahh... I feel better than ever!
[Veyle] 
Clanne, you've got to try your new recipe.
[Clanne] 
Huh?!
[Veyle] 
No, don't worry. They're really, really good.
[Clanne] 
Oh... OK. I mean, if you say they're good...
[Clanne] 
Mm...mmm...
[Clanne] 
Ugh... Hah... Hah-haah...hot! Hot, hot, hot! HOT!
[Clanne] 
So spicy, but...I can sort of feel my mouth 
again, and sort of taste too.
[Clanne] 
You're right. These are really, really good!
[Veyle] 
See? Aren't you glad you tried something new?
[Clanne] 
For once, I really am!
[Clanne] 
...
[Clanne] 
You challenged me to make better pickles. Now 
there's something else I'd like you to try.
[Veyle] 
Ooo! Do you have some even spicier pickles 
for me?
[Clanne] 
No, not pickles. I thought maybe you might like 
to try being my sister.
[Veyle] 
Oh!
[Clanne] 
Nothing serious, you know, just kind of acting 
like brother and, I guess, older sister.
[Clanne] 
You helped me make better pickles, so I thought 
I'd help you become comfortable as a sibling.
[Veyle] 
That would be nice...
[Veyle] 
But is it OK? Wouldn't that be asking a lot 
of you?
[Clanne] 
Let me be clear. You taught me a whole new 
way of making pickles, Lady Veyle.
[Clanne] 
It's the least I could do.
[Veyle] 
Oh, I see. Well then...yes. I'll be your sister.
[Clanne] 
All right, then. Welcome to the family.
[Veyle] 
So I'm the older sister and you're the younger 
brother.
[Clanne] 
My sister's the younger twin, so I've always 
wanted an older sibling to see what it's like.
[Veyle] 
And I don't have a younger sibling, so this is 
perfect. From now on, you are my little brother.
[Clanne] 
Thanks, big sister!
[Veyle] 
Hehe, it feels a little weird to be called "big 
sister." Weird...but good.
