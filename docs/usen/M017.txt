=== Chapter 17 Serenity in Ruin ===

(Florra Port)
Chasing Elusian warships heading
to Firene, the Divine Dragon's army
arrives at Florra Port.

--- OP ---




[Alear]
I don't see any Elusian soldiers yet.
[Alfred]
They're likely headed for the castle. We'd better
go to Florra Port.
That's the port closest to Firene Castle. You
might remember it from your first time here.
[Alear]
Right, my first time here. I was so taken in by
those beautiful, rolling hills...
Oh no.
[Alfred]
What's wrong?
[Alear]
Smoke. From the northeast.
[Alfred]
That's the direction of Florra Port. They must
have... No, no, no!
[Alear]
Let's go.




[Alear]
Florra...
[Alfred]
Why would they do this? These people aren't
soldiers. Farmers live here. Families.
[Alear]
Don't give in to despair, Alfred. For your
kingdom's sake, we have to be strong.
There are more Elusian warships off the coast.
If any more make land, Firene will crumble.
We need to fend off the incoming vessels and
then rescue as many villagers as we can.
[Alfred]
[Zephia]
Oh dear, what a mess! And the smell from that
smoke. It's really quite horrid.
[Alear]
Zephia.


[Veyle]
!
[Alear]
And Veyle, you too? I'm guessing this is
your handiwork.
[Veyle]
No, absolutely not! We only just got here.
I heard you'd be coming to Firene and I wanted
to talk.
[Alear]
Why do you think we're here? Because we saw
Elusia's army coming.
Your army. The one that's burning Florra to
the ground.
You're Sombron's daughter. How can you not
know what his forces are doing?
[Veyle]
I'm...not sure.
Griss, did you order this attack? Is that how you
knew where to go?
[Zephia]

[Griss]
[Griss]
...
[Veyle]
Griss! Tell me!
[Griss]
Sure, I knew about the attack. But I'm not the
one who gave the order.
[Veyle]
Well then, who did? What monster told our
forces to attack a town of innocent people?
[Griss]
[Zephia]
[Zephia]
Why, it was you.
[Veyle]
Wh...what?
[Zephia]
The homes up in smoke. The people burning to
death, crying for help, any help at all...
It was your design. Your command.
[Veyle]
Mine?
[Zephia]
[Marni]
Ah, we finally made it! What did I miss?
[Marni]
[Mauvier]
Forgive our lateness. There was a complication.
[Veyle]
Marni... Mauvier...
[Mauvier]
[Marni]
Hey, Lady Veyle! Hope you've had some rest
after that long trip. Guess I'm a little late.
But I'm ready and rarin' to kill everyone in
the town, like you said!
[Veyle]
What? Why would you do such a horrible thing?
Those are innocent people!
[Marni]
Innocent? It's not like you to care about that.
Oh, I get it. You switched, huh? You're the
boring one.
[Veyle]
Switched? The boring... What do you mean?!
Someone, explain this to me!
[Griss]
[Zephia]
Hahaha!
All right. It was a chore dealing with
you anyway.
I'll tell you the truth. You should hear this as
well, Divine One.
[Alear]
The truth?
[Zephia]
You want to know why you're clueless? Why
you can't remember ordering the attack?
Because it was the other Lady Veyle's doing.
Along with every other move we've made.
[Alear]
The other Veyle?
[Zephia]
Lord Sombron desired a Fell Child suitable to
carry on his legacy.
You disobeyed him. Failed to use your Fell
Dragon powers. Wished for peace. Hmph.
You were a defect, unworthy of your parentage.
Thus Lord Sombron gave me the power to
make a few...adjustments.
[Veyle]
Wh...what adjustments?
[Alear]
What did you do to her?
[Zephia]
It was simple, really. I strengthened your
draconic impulses the teensiest bit.
Then, you thought nothing of killing humans.
You embodied Lord Sombron's will.
Killing Lumera, stealing the rings, unleashing
the Corrupted across Elyos...all your doing.
[Veyle]
That's... That's why I kept waking up in places
I didn't recognize...
[Zephia]
Yes. As your consciousness slept, the other
was awake, carrying out her work.
Think of it. You, fighting the Corrupted...that
you had created!
But it gets better. The Fell Dragon's daughter,
and the Divine Dragon...became friends!
Hah! Hilarious, isn't it? And pathetic.
[Veyle]
No... No!
I'm sorry. You were right... I've done
horrible things!
[Alear]
The person who killed my mother and stole
our rings...
It was Veyle, but...not?
[Zephia]
There you have it, Lady Veyle! I'd say the
misunderstanding has been resolved.
[Veyle]
Zephia, Griss, Marni, Mauvier... You weren't
my friends!
I'm alone! I've always been alone! I... I...
[Alear]
Veyle, it's all right! Please...let me help you.
[Veyle]


[Griss]
How 'bout no?
[Alear]
...

TS

[Zephia]
From this point on, I no longer have any need of you.
TS

[Zephia]
Sleep now. Go on─drift off into a dream.
[Veyle]
N-no...
[Zephia]
Time to wake up, Lady Veyle. We do need you. I know how
disappointed you would be if you were to miss the bloodshed.
[Veyle]
You're a liar... I'm nothing like...that...
...
Thank you for waking me, Zephia. I've been so
looking forward to having some fun.
Fetch me the Ring of the Hero-King.
[Zephia]
Yes, as you wish.


[Alear]
Marth!
[Veyle]
And my Hounds, prepare yourselves as well.
[Zephia]
Whatever you desire, my lady.
[Veyle]
Ah, how exciting this is.
I hope they have the endurance to at least resist
a little─it's no fun if they just die.
Right? Don't you agree, ?
You know, seeing as how I don't share memories with
that pathetic little girl...I simply had no idea you and I
were friends now.
I hope that you can forgive my rudeness.
[Alear]
Your apology means nothing to me. You're not
Veyle. Give her back!
[Veyle]
Rest assured that I am Veyle. Yes, in fact, I am Veyle
in her truest form.
Only one of us deserves the honor of calling the great Fell Dragon
her father. That honor belongs to me─and me alone!
[Alear]
My friends, it's time to fight!


--- ED ---



[Griss]
Damn! The ring we gave Hyacinth─they
snatched it!
[Marni]
We gotta protect the other ones. Let's get 'em
onto the ship!
[Griss]
[Mauvier]
I will take the Ring of the Hero-King.
[Zephia]
Come, my lady. We must hurry.


[Veyle]
...
[Zephia]
Is something the matter?
[Veyle]
Zephia. Give me your ring.
[Zephia]
What are you planning?
[Veyle]
Just do it!
[Zephia]
Very well.

[Veyle]
Please, take this!
[Alear]
But why?!
[Veyle]
I know you can't forgive me...for all the things
I've done. But still...
You must know... I need you to know that even
though our friendship was brief...
it meant everything!



[Griss]
What the hell?!
[Zephia]
You filthy defect.
[Veyle]
AAH!
[Veyle]
[Zephia]
[Griss]


[Alear]
Veyle!
[Alear]

[Zephia]
When we return, I'll see that you never wake
up again!
[Marni]
Mauvier, keep an eye on those other rings!
[Mauvier]
Understood.
[Zephia]
[Marni]
[Mauvier]


[Alear]
The Ring of the Holy Knight.
Thank you, Veyle.




[Alear]
Emblem Sigurd. Emblem Leif. I'm glad you two
are back.
[Sigurd]
As am I. Allow me to apologize for failing to
protect you at the cathedral.
All this time, within my dimmed consciousness,
I feared you and I would never again meet.
[Alear]
Sigurd... That was my fault, not yours.
[Leif]
As you saw, they have been twisting Veyle's
mind and using her as a pawn.
With Sombron's movement limited, it is she
who carries out his will.
[Alear]
I see...
[Sigurd]
[Leif]

[Diamant]
Should we try to rescue her?
[Alear]
First, we have to help the people of Florra.
We can go to Elusia after we've put out the
remaining fires and rescued the survivors.
With this fight, we have eight rings. We're at
an advantage to take the other four.
[Diamant]
Yes. Victory is in sight.
[Diamant]


[Alear]
Alfred, why don't you go to the castle?
Tell Queen Ève what has happened here.

[Timerra]
Yeah. Leave the village to us.
[Alfred]
Thanks, everyone. I appreciate it.
[Timerra]
[Alfred]

[Alear]
...
Be safe, Veyle.

[Veyle]
Oh, that's right. I have an exciting surprise
for you.
[Veyle]
$ [Corrupted] , [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
Ivy. And you, Divine Dragon. It's been some
time, has it not?

[Alear]
King Hyacinth?
[Alear]

[Ivy]
Father! You're alive?
[Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
[Veyle]
He's not. This is Corrupted Hyacinth.
[Ivy]

[Alear]
You mean...
[Veyle]
Looks good as new, hm? Not like Father's
"King Morion." I can do much better than that.
When I create the Corrupted, they are just
like themselves.
But at times, that can be a hindrance, so I made
some modifications.

[Alear]
This is unimaginable.
[Veyle]
Princess Ivy earned this.
[Alear]

[Ivy]
Why me?
[Veyle]
For stealing the rings from Destinea Cathedral.
Ever since then, I have longed for vengeance.

[Ivy]

Hyacinth, I intended to give you the Ring of the
Lady of the Plains. But your daughter stole it.
Take this instead─the Ring of the Sage Lord.

[Veyle]
$ [Corrupted] , [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
Yes, Lady Veyle.

[Ivy]
You would have me fight my own father?
[Ivy]

[Alear]
No! You can't treat people like this!
Don't you understand how cruel this is?
[Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
[Veyle]
Cruel? This is easily the most fun I've ever had.
Speaking of fun... All of the Emblem Rings
are here.
" Six on your side, six on mine. There's no telling
who might win.

[Alear]
Veyle...
[Veyle]
Now then, , let the killing begin.

" [Veyle]
Hero-King! Let's make it hurt, shall we?

[Veyle]
Impressed by Father's power? Fell Dragons
are far beyond Divine Dragons.

[Zephia]
No need for restraint, Sigurd. Run wild!

" [Zephia]
Hahaha! Look upon the might of Lord Sombron!

$ [Corrupted] , [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
Give in to your impulses, Emblem Leif.

$ [Corrupted] , [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
Lord Sombron is limitless. I was right in
my actions.


[Alear]
The Emblem is going wild. This is just like what
happened at Solm Palace.
This poses a real challenge.

[Mauvier]
I will stop at nothing to protect Lady Veyle.

[Mauvier]
What more could I have done?

$ [Corrupted] , [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
Ivy.

[Ivy]
Father. I've not seen you since we were at the
Brodian border.
That was our farewell. In this life, at least.
[Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
It need not be. I can appeal to Lord Sombron─
ask him to welcome you back as our ally.

[Ivy]
No. You are...not you. I will not cling tearfully
to my father's shadow.
[Ivy] Die
But I am grateful for this.
Grateful for the chance to thank you, say
goodbye, and tell you that as Elusia's queen...
I will surpass you.

$ [Corrupted] , [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
Hortensia.
[Hortensia]
Father! I've missed you. I wanted to see you
so badly.
I've been so sad since you died...
[Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
Then, dear daughter, follow me. Kill your friends
and bring me their rings.
[Hortensia]
No, I won't. I want to live up to my father,
the wise king of Elusia...
My real father. Before the Fell Dragon
ruined him.
. [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
Rrgh...
[Hortensia]
Goodbye, Father. I'm sad we didn't have more
time together. I love you.
Soon this will all be over, OK? Soon you'll be
able to rest.

$ [Corrupted] * [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
I remember nothing... That look on your face─is
it fear or hatred?

$ [Corrupted] * [Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Hyacinth]
The moment I slipped into the Fell Dragon's
thrall, my fate was sealed.
( [Corrupted] Ivy, Hortensia... I'm sorry. Know that I love
you both.
* [Corrupted] Elusia is yours to lead...and yours to save.

[Veyle]
Hehehe, I'm so glad you came.
Quite a backdrop, isn't it? Florra looks much
prettier up in flames.
I knew you'd come if I set it ablaze.
And the Corrupted that frightened you so
much... They're not so scary this way, are they?

[Alear]
Are you talking about King Hyacinth?
[Veyle]
Yes. I thought seeing him would make you
smile. We are friends, after all!
Oh, but we had a falling out, didn't we? The
other Veyle must be simply heartbroken.

[Alear]
...

[Veyle]
Ah, a new toy! I'm going to enjoy this.
" Can you defeat your old friend Marth?

[Veyle]
How could this happen? I promise, you will not
survive our next encounter.

[Zephia]
You think you can defeat me and my knight?
Then by all means, try.

[Zephia]
Ngh. Armed like this, and yet I did not win...

[Griss]
Haha! You hit me, I hit you! Let's get this pain
party started!

[Griss]
Mmm, delicious pain. Let's do that
again sometime.

[Marni]
With him at my side, I'm invincible! You're going
down for sure!

[Marni]
No fair, no fair, no fair!
