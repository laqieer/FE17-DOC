=== Louis & Ivy ===
--- C ---



[Ivy]
Louis.
[Louis]
Yes, Princess Ivy?
[Ivy]
You always seem so cheerful. Is there some
particular reason for it?
[Louis]
No, this is simply my default expression.
[Ivy]
How curious.
[Ivy]
It may be due to my own reservedness that your
demeanor leaves such an impression on me.
[Louis]
It's true, now that you mention it, that I haven't
seen much cheer in you.
[Louis]
And what a sight that would be to see!
[Ivy]
What are you suggesting?
[Louis]
I have a keen eye for observing the way people
socialize, you see.
[Ivy]
This is not reassuring.
[Louis]
Which is why I was so powerfully struck by the
idea of seeing you in such a context.
[Louis]
The princess Ivy, among dear friends, wearing
a wide grin...what a captivating thought!
[Ivy]
I will thank you not to cast me for any role in
your imaginary theater.
[Louis]
The first step is to figure out what you might
have cause to celebrate.
[Louis]
I think it may help if you accompany me
for a time.
[Ivy]
...
[Ivy]
Your dedication to your goals, off-putting as
they may be, is impressive.
[Ivy]
Very well, Louis of Firene. If your ambition is to
make me smile, I invite you to do your best.
[Louis]
My best is all I can do, Princess Ivy.

[Louis]
What do you think, Princess Ivy? Does the sight
of a pleasant gathering prompt any feelings?
[Ivy]
No. Nothing.
[Louis]
How strange. I, for my part, find great comfort
in their mundane joys and idle chatter.
[Ivy]
It would seem that phenomenon is unique
to you.
[Louis]
Oh? What a pity.
[Ivy]
Was that the full extent of your plan?
[Ivy]
Did you actually pin all your hopes on this sight
inspiring me to...chat?
[Louis]
No. I haven't quite given up.
[Louis]
Though I don't as yet have any other ideas.
[Louis]
Until I do, would you like a cup of tea? I'll put
on a pot of the black tea blend I've been saving.
[Ivy]
Tea does sound lovely, actually. Thank you.
[Louis]
Aha!
[Ivy]
What? What is it?
[Louis]
I thought I detected the faintest hint of a smile
just now.
[Ivy]
Did you?
[Louis]
Can I take it, then, that you like black tea?
[Ivy]
Yes. But if I happened to seem pleased, that was
not the reason.
[Ivy]
I simply find your dedication to these efforts
rather amusing.
[Louis]
There's nothing so amusing about it.
A princess's joy is a radiant thing.
[Ivy]
Hm.
[Louis]
Ah! Was that another smile?
[Ivy]
Oh, enough. You promised me tea. Let's have it!
[Louis]
Haha, as you wish, Princess Ivy.

[Ivy]
Louis, would you indulge me with another cup
of that wonderful tea?
[Louis]
You've put me in an awkward position,
Princess Ivy.
[Ivy]
If you are busy, it can certainly wait...
[Louis]
It isn't that. The problem for me is your
recent mood.
[Ivy]
Still disappointed that I don't smile as easily as
you'd like?
[Louis]
Not at all. You were incandescent with joy when
you entered the room, in fact.
[Ivy]
Was I?
[Louis]
It is the very incandescence of that joy which
poses such a problem for me, you see.
[Louis]
Did you not realize how brightly you shone?
[Ivy]
No... I did not.
[Louis]
Such unadulterated joy isn't meant for my like.
It should be reserved for others like yourself.
[Louis]
My role is merely to facilitate these bright
moments and then recede until I am needed.
[Ivy]
Haha, I...have no idea how to respond to that.
[Louis]
And now a laugh?! All of this is wasted on me,
Princess Ivy.
[Louis]
It is peculiar, though...
[Louis]
I still haven't the faintest idea of what causes
you to beam this way.
[Ivy]
How dare you?
[Ivy]
I am not a monster, you know. I am capable
of smiling around friends and allies.
[Louis]
Is that what I am in your eyes? An ally? Even...
a friend?
[Ivy]
Don't be ridiculous. Hurry up and make the tea,
would you?
[Louis]
As you wish, Princess Ivy. I'll brew the most
exceptional pot of tea you've ever tasted.
[Ivy]
I expect only the best from you, Louis.
