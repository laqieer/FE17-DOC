[Céline] 
Greetings, Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia] 
Princess Céline!
[Hortensia] 
Hmm...yeah. Yep.
[Hortensia] 
You're gonna be tough, but I won't lose.
[Céline] 
Pardon, but...what are you talking about?
[Hortensia] 
Oh, you're good.
[Hortensia] 
We might even be evenly matched, but you 
won't catch me admitting that in competition.
[Hortensia] 
I mean, you won't catch me surrendering the 
field of battle!
[Céline] 
We are...battling, then?
[Hortensia] 
Yes! And I will ignore whatever I need to...to 
proclaim...
[Hortensia] 
Princess Céline! You are no match for me!
[Hortensia] 
I will defeat you in cuteness! And while I'm at it, 
everything else!
[Céline] 
Hmm...
[Céline] 
Hahaha! So that's what you were raving about. 
How rambunctious you are.
[Hortensia] 
"Rambunctious"?
[Hortensia] 
Hmph! Be all calm and superior while you can!
[Hortensia] 
I'm gonna fantabulize you into the ground!
[Hortensia] 
Might as well get it over with and surrender! 
Bwahahaha!
[Hortensia] 

[Céline] 
Is she leaving so soon? I had hoped to invite 
her to tea.
[Céline] 
What a darling girl, though. I wish I had a 
younger sister as adorable.

[Céline] 
We meet again, Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia] 
We do indeed meet, Princess Céline!
[Hortensia] 
Let the competition commence! The first event 
will be...the softness contest!
[Hortensia] 
Who will be softer─you or me?! Let's try you 
first. Poke!
[Céline] 
Hahaha! That tickles!
[Hortensia] 
...
[Hortensia] 
The softness contest is hereby canceled.
[Céline] 
So soon?
[Hortensia] 
Strategic adjustments need to be made.
[Céline] 
That's unfortunate. I wanted to have a turn to 
poke at you.
[Hortensia] 
Wait, really? Hey, no! Your mind games won't 
distract me─we're competitors!
[Céline] 
Heh heh, of course we are.
[Hortensia] 
Ugh... What is wrong with me?
[Hortensia] 
This girl's so adorable she's messing with my 
mind. Ugh... Insidious!
[Céline] 
My turn! Let's see how soft you are! Poke!
[Hortensia] 
I told you, that contest is canceled!
[Céline] 
Forgive me. I was overcome with curiosity and 
couldn't help myself.
[Hortensia] 
Why is she smiling like that?! Agh... Why do 
I LIKE it?!
[Hortensia] 
Enough of your tricks! I'm the cutest there is! 
I'll never be outdone!
[Hortensia] 
Aaagh!
[Hortensia] 

[Céline] 
There she goes again. Drat! It seems I once 
more missed my chance to invite her to tea.

[Céline] 
You don't seem your usual rambunctious self 
today, Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia] 
OK, Princess Céline. Fine.
[Hortensia] 
I admit it.
[Céline] 
Admit what?
[Hortensia] 
You're cuter than me. I admit defeat.
[Hortensia] 
I was doomed from the start, really. Who can 
even take their eyes off you?
[Céline] 
That is high praise indeed.
[Céline] 
And yet...
[Céline] 
I'm not through poking you. Poke, poke, poke!
[Hortensia] 
Ah! Ahahaha, why?!
[Céline] 
Shall we call the contest an amicable draw?
[Céline] 
You do not lack for cuteness. And you wear 
your mood plainly on your face.
[Céline] 
Little do you realize what a comfort those two 
things are to those around you.
[Hortensia] 
You...really think so?
[Céline] 
I do. And never mind my charms. You have 
unique charms all your own.
[Céline] 
I daresay a smile suits you better than a pout.
[Hortensia] 
When you say things like that, I...
[Hortensia] 
Aaah, it only makes me like you more!
[Céline] 
Good. I was already quite fond of you.
[Hortensia] 
How can you just stand there being all calm 
and perfect?
[Céline] 
Come, Princess Hortensia. Won't you join me 
for a cup of tea?
[Céline] 
I've wanted to extend the invitation for some 
time now.
[Hortensia] 
Tea? With you?
[Céline] 
Hahaha, indeed. I think that we two younger 
sisters will have a great deal in common.
[Céline] 
As a sign of our friendship, I've imported a 
special blend from Elusia.
[Hortensia] 
That's so sweet of you! Yeah, let's go 
right now!
[Céline] 
Excellent! Let this tea party, the first of 
many, commence!
