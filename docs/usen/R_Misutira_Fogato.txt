=== Timerra & Fogado ===
--- C ---




[Timerra]
Well, well! If it isn't Fogado, my one and only
sibby, hehehe!
[Fogado]
Hahaha, yes! In the flesh. Care to tell me why
you're in such a good mood?
[Timerra]
Oh, no reason in particular.
[Fogado]
Really? I would have guessed there was a song
or a slab of meat involved.
[Fogado]
Mind, I'm glad to see you looking so cheery.
Always puts a smile on my face.
[Timerra]
Well, good! Because I'm happy as can be.
[Fogado]
But I'm going to have to insist you tell me why.
Come on─sibby to sibby.
[Timerra]
If you really wanna know...
[Timerra]
It's because you're here! Duh!
[Fogado]
Is that all? Pfft, I'm always here.
[Timerra]
Oh ho! Hate to break it to you, but no.
[Timerra]
I'll admit, back in Solm, I didn't spend all that
much time in the castle. But you?
[Timerra]
You were never around! I hardly spent time
with you at all.
[Fogado]
Ah, yeah. You make a good point.
[Timerra]
These aren't what you'd call the best
circumstances, but I'm glad I see you every day.
[Fogado]
Wow. You really put a positive spin on things.
[Fogado]
We're in the middle of a war, and you make it
sound like a family vacation.
[Timerra]
Got a problem with that?
[Fogado]
Not one bit. As I said, I'm just happy that
you're happy.

[Fogado]
Hey, listen. I want to talk about something.
[Timerra]
What's up, Fogado? You look kinda down.
[Fogado]
Yeah, well... I think I owe you an apology.
[Timerra]
I knew it! You're the one who stole my rib tips!
I was saving those for a late-night snack.
[Fogado]
What?! No, I would never do that! I know how
much you love your midnight meats!
[Fogado]
Wait a second. What's this "I knew it" business?
You don't trust your own brother?
[Timerra]
Hehe! Hehe, sorry, sorry. I get cranky when
I wake up on an empty stomach.
[Timerra]
Anyway, what was that about an apology?
[Fogado]
I was thinking about what you said. How I
wasn't around much in the castle.
[Fogado]
I've always felt that because our people are free
spirits, they deserve a free-spirited prince.
[Fogado]
But now I realize that it got in the way of our
sibby time. I'll try to do better from now on.
[Timerra]
Listen, Fogado.
[Timerra]
I know that "free spirit" stuff doesn't tell the
whole story.
[Timerra]
You leave the castle to get a lay of the land.
Make it easier to plan for a crisis. Right?
[Timerra]
So that if the worst happens, you'll be ready to
advise me.
[Fogado]
Hahaha, of course you knew.
[Timerra]
Well, yeah. We are sibbies, aren't we?
[Timerra]
I know everything that's going on in that cute,
little head of yours!
[Timerra]
I do appreciate all you do for me. As far as little
brothers go, I'd say I lucked out.
[Fogado]
We're family. We watch out for each other.
[Timerra]
If I'm honest, though...sometimes I don't want
you to watch out for me.
[Timerra]
I just want you to hang out with me. You know?
[Timerra]
Like right now. This is perfect.

[Fogado]
Timerra! I've solved it!
[Timerra]
Huh? Did something need solving? First I'm
hearing of it.
[Fogado]
Here, take this. I stayed up all night making it.
[Timerra]
A doll? Why did you... Wait.
[Timerra]
No way─it's YOU! This is a YOU doll!
[Fogado]
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!
[Fogado]
Now we'll always be together. You don't have
to feel lonely anymore.
[Fogado]
Even when I'm away from the castle, it'll be like
I'm right there with you.
[Fogado]
And he'll keep you safe.
[Timerra]
Ugh, you ruined it.
[Timerra]
I'm not a little kid. What's a doll gonna protect
me from? Doll bandits?
[Fogado]
Ah...
[Timerra]
Besides, this thing hardly even looks like you!
[Timerra]
I'd have to squint something fierce to pretend
that Faux-gado here is the real article.
[Fogado]
I worked so hard on him, though. You don't
think he has his dad's signature swagger?
[Timerra]
Yeah, no, not even a little bit. Guess you have
no choice.
[Timerra]
You'll just have to hang out with me more.
[Timerra]
We're the princess and prince, but first and
foremost, we're sibbies.
[Fogado]
Yeah, you're right.
[Fogado]
You win. I'll spend less time wandering Solm
and more time with you.
[Timerra]
Good! Was that so hard?
[Fogado]
I guess you won't be needing that doll.
[Timerra]
I didn't say that! I'm going to give my
wonky-looking nephew here a loving home.
[Fogado]
Hahaha, perfect. Though just so you know,
he doesn't eat meat.
