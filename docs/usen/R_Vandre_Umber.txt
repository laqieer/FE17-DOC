=== Vander & Amber ===
--- C ---



[Amber]
Hey, Vander. Where do you keep the legendary
weapons around here?
[Vander]
Legendary weapons? What in the world are you
talking about, Amber?
[Amber]
I've always wanted a legendary weapon.
[Amber]
The Somniel seems to have lots of sacred spots.
One of them must have a sword or something...
[Vander]
I do not waste my time on folklore and fluff.
[Amber]
Oh. So that's a no? Gotcha. I guess I'll just poke
around and see if I find anything.
[Vander]
Actually...I suppose there is one surefire way
to obtain a legendary weapon.
[Amber]
Really?! What is it? How can I get my hands
on one? Please, Vander! You've gotta tell me.
[Vander]
Think. What is a legendary weapon, essentially?
[Amber]
Huh?
[Vander]
For a weapon to become a legend, a legendary
hero must wield it first. Right?
[Amber]
Huh... Yeah, I guess that makes sense.
[Vander]
Well then, Sir Amber, all you must do is attain
the moniker of legendary hero.
[Amber]
A legendary hero? Me?
[Amber]
Yeah. Yeah! If I pull that off, my trusty lance...
[Vander]
It would become a legendary weapon. Correct.
[Amber]
WHOA-HO-HO-HOOO!
[Amber]
Vander! You just blew my mind! I'm gonna do
exactly that. My legend starts right now!

[Amber]
Hnh... Hah...
[Amber]
Not done yet... Have to...train more.
[Vander]
Well, well. How nice to see you working up a
sweat at such an early hour, Sir Amber.
[Amber]
You bet. I've got to grow as strong as I can.
[Amber]
I have to become a legend, just like you said.
Then my lance will be a legendary weapon.
[Vander]
He took my brush-off seriously? He is either
truly devoted...or a fool.
[Amber]
Hm? You say something?
[Vander]
I was, um, just wondering why you desire a
legendary weapon so badly.
[Amber]
I grew up in a dull country town. Nothing to do,
nothing to see. Stories were my only escape.
[Amber]
My favorite was about this one hero who used a
legendary weapon to defeat a giant monster.
[Vander]
Hmm...
[Amber]
I think about that story all the time. I want to be
a hero like that...so I need a legendary weapon.
[Vander]
I see. If you are so dedicated, then...why not
train with me?
[Amber]
Really?! You mean it? I would love that!
[Amber]
You're so strong and cool-looking. I bet you do
all kinds of crazy training.
[Vander]
Hmph. Just try to keep up. I will not hold back
for your sake, "hero."

[Amber]
Urgh...
[Vander]
Struggling already, hero? These are but core
exercises. We have not even begun the sprints.
[Amber]
Ugh... I'm dyin' here, Vander. Do you always
train this hard?
[Vander]
I do.
[Amber]
This is unbelievable. I'm barely able to keep up!
[Vander]
Is this it? What happened to your enthusiasm?
I thought you wished to become a legend!
[Amber]
Oh... I'm too tired to defend myself. Ugh...
[Amber]
If this is your routine, I'm pretty sure you're
already a legend. Can I just have your weapon?
[Vander]
No! I told you, I have no interest in legendary
weapons or being a legend myself. However...
[Vander]
I see how hard your generation is working to
better the world. THAT is the stuff of legends.
[Vander]
You are dedicated, driven, and show incredible
potential. Your own story has just begun.
[Vander]
Keep reaching for that dream. If you do, your
weapon will soon belong to a true legend.
[Amber]
Aw, Vander. I will!
[Amber]
My weapon will be legendary, and so will I!
Just like the stories I used to read as a kid.
[Vander]
An admirable goal...and one you will achieve
sooner if you stop complaining. Understand?
[Amber]
Yes, sir. I'll keep training as hard as I can!
