=== Framme & Goldmary ===

[Goldmary]
Here we are, Framme. This is the perfect spot
for apple picking.
[Framme]
Oooh, it's pretty!
[Framme]
Kind of a long hike just to get some fruit to cook
with, don't you think? Phew!
[Goldmary]
The best food requires the best ingredients.
Gathering them takes effort.
[Framme]
Just getting here was a serious workout.
Cooking is no joke!
[Framme]
I can't wait to relax in a nice warm bath after
I get home.
[Framme]
Uh, Goldmary? What are you doing?!
[Goldmary]
What's the matter?
[Framme]
Why are you taking your clothes off?!
[Framme]
Put them back on this instant!
[Goldmary]
There's a lovely spring right here. I thought
I would take a quick dip.
[Framme]
A little warning would've been nice!
[Goldmary]
Warning? For what? I was only going to
rinse off.
[Goldmary]
You said yourself you were looking forward
to a bath after that long hike.
[Framme]
Um, sure...but I was planning on doing that
when I got home.
[Framme]
You're really comfortable enough to just take a
bath out in the open?
[Goldmary]
Yes, it seems normal to me. But that's probably
because I grew up in a village with hot springs.
[Framme]
I always thought you seemed pretty shy, but it
looks like I was totally wrong.
[Framme]
I guess that's what I get for judging by
appearances, huh...

[Goldmary]
Aw...
[Framme]
Hey, Goldmary! How'd it turn out with the
apples we gathered the other day?
[Goldmary]
Better than I could have possibly imagined,
unfortunately...
[Goldmary]
They also ruined my life.
[Framme]
Um, what? How?
[Goldmary]
I was so delighted eating the dish I made that
my face bore a terribly inelegant expression.
[Framme]
Um, I don't get it. Your face looks fine to me.
[Goldmary]
It's fine now, but there's nothing I can do about
those who saw it. They'll remember forever.
[Framme]
I still don't think I see the problem, but OK...
[Goldmary]
How can you not see? Whenever those people
look at me, they'll see nothing but a silly face.
[Framme]
I really don't think they will, if they even noticed
the, um, expression to begin with.
[Framme]
You sound like you could use a break though.
Hey, how about taking a soak in a hot spring?
[Framme]
That'd be nice and relaxing, right? Get you
feeling back to your elegant self again?
[Goldmary]
No! I can't do that!
[Framme]
What? Why not?!
[Goldmary]
What if someone who saw my silly face is
there? What if they tell everyone?!
[Goldmary]
I'd never live it down...
[Framme]
I'm sure that won't happen, Goldmary. Look,
this isn't the end of the world, OK?
[Goldmary]
If everyone there knew how ridiculous I looked,
I could never go to the hot springs again.
[Goldmary]
There's no way to know if anyone who saw me
would be there...until I went there.
[Goldmary]
It's like wanting to go shopping for clothes...
without having an outfit to wear to the store...
[Framme]
OK, I...don't really get it, but I'm sure it's
nothing to worry about. Please don't cry.
[Goldmary]
Will you...help me rehearse my demeanor until
it's graceful and refined again?
[Framme]
Um...
[Framme]
Sure, yeah. Whatever makes you feel better...
[Goldmary]
Thank you, Framme.

[Goldmary]
Hello, Framme. Notice anything different
about me?
[Goldmary]
That's right. My place in the world has been
restored. I'm once again the picture of elegance.
[Framme]
Hey, that's great! I'm glad our efforts paid off.
[Framme]
I mean...you don't seem any different to me.
But I'm glad you're feeling better.
[Goldmary]
You can't tell? I'm tilting my head 10 degrees
instead of that unseemly 15.
[Framme]
Umm... OK!
[Goldmary]
I really must thank you, Framme.
[Goldmary]
You stood by me even when my head was tilted
much too far to be taken seriously.
[Goldmary]
You were even there to help me practice
my expression until I got it exactly right.
[Goldmary]
Thanks to you, I understand that one graceless
moment isn't going to ruin a friendship.
[Framme]
Exactly. Friends aren't superficial with each
other like that.
[Goldmary]
Would you let me give my thanks in the form
of a delicious home-cooked meal?
[Framme]
Yeah! I'd love that!
[Goldmary]
I will make something with those apples we
gathered. It will be both tasty and nutritious.
[Framme]
Ooh, I can't wait! This is gonna be amazing!
[Goldmary]
Try to temper your expectations. It will only be
about as good as the top restaurants.
[Framme]
Only that good, huh? Hehe, you're really
confident in your cooking.
[Goldmary]
I'm sorry in advance if the delights I prepare
ruin your taste buds to all other cuisine...
[Framme]
Hehehe! I'm glad to see you're fully back to
your old self, Goldmary.
[Framme]
And I can't wait to try what you cook up!
