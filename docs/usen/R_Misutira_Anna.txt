[Anna]
Hey! Princess Timerra!
[Timerra]
Hey, Lady Anna! What's up?
[Anna]
Quick question─what don't they have enough
of in the queendom of Solm?
[Timerra]
Haha! Is this a riddle? I love riddles! OK, let's
think this through...
[Anna]
It's not a riddle, or any other kind of game.
[Timerra]
Oh, it's not? Then why are you asking?
[Anna]
Knowing what's lacking in Solm will help me
decide what to stock and sell, right?
[Anna]
I thought if anyone knows all there is to know
about Solm, it'd be you.
[Timerra]
So you came to me for advice on what to
sell there. Makes sense.
[Anna]
Now that I've been separated from my family,
I've gotta make a living somehow.
[Anna]
Business is my only real hope.
[Timerra]
You know...Solm already has a lot of merchants.
It's not the easiest market to break into.
[Anna]
So you're saying that distribution channels for
standard goods are already well established?
[Anna]
In that case, I'll focus on selling my own unique
products. That should be enough to compete!
[Timerra]
Ooo, not a bad idea, Lady Anna!
[Timerra]
I'm happy to help you bring a new product to
the people of Solm. Just lemme know.
[Anna]
Thanks, Princess Timerra. Well, no time to
waste! I'd better start doing some research.

[Anna]
Hey, Princess Timerra! Guess what!
[Anna]
My new product is finally ready to hit the
market. Wait until you see this.
[Timerra]
Yes! I cannot tell you how much I've looked
forward to this. Come on, let's see it!
[Anna]
First, I asked myself, "What kind of problems do
the people of Solm face every day?"
[Timerra]
Hm. High levels of sun exposure, water scarcity,
bugs─you would not believe the bugs I've seen.
[Anna]
Good guesses, but no.
[Anna]
How many times have you dropped something
in the sand and never found it again?
[Timerra]
Huh. Well, uh...a few, I guess.
[Anna]
That's where this comes in!
[Timerra]
Oh! A rake. Don't people use that to
gather leaves?
[Anna]
You must be thinking of some other rake. This
one's for finding stuff lost in the sands!
[Timerra]
I'm...not following.
[Anna]
Say you drop something and the sand swallows
it up. Not a problem with your new sand rake!
[Anna]
Well? Pretty handy, right?
[Timerra]
Ye─ No, not really, no.
[Anna]
I knew it was a reach even while I was saying it.
[Timerra]
But hey, it's definitely innovative! I doubt
anyone else would have come up with that.
[Anna]
Thanks for saying so, Princess Timerra.
[Anna]
I haven't given up yet. The next product I
develop will be the talk of Solm!
[Timerra]
Attagirl! You show 'em, Lady Anna!

[Anna]
Hmm... What's my angle here?


[Timerra]
Hey, Lady Anna. You're really stressing about
this new product, huh?
[Anna]
Oh, hey, Princess Timerra.
[Anna]
I just know whatever I come up with won't sell
well in Solm unless it stands out as truly unique.
[Timerra]
Yeah, it's pretty competitive...
[Anna]
What's got you so down?
[Timerra]
Aw, y'know. I just hate to see a friend struggle.
[Anna]
That's so sweet.
[Anna]
But I'm not really struggling. Well, I am, but it's
not so bad.
[Timerra]
It's not?
[Anna]
Figuring out the details when I'm working on
a new product is my favorite part.
[Anna]
"What does this new market need?" "How can
what I'm offering make everyone the happiest?"
[Anna]
It's not easy, but the thrill I get when I crack the
problem is worth it.
[Anna]
It's the best part of being a merchant!
[Timerra]
Huh, OK! That makes sense!
[Anna]
So don't worry about me.
[Anna]
I'll figure this out. And when I do, everyone in
Solm will love it.
[Timerra]
Yeah! That's the spirit!
[Timerra]
You know what? I just thought of something.
[Anna]
What's that?
[Timerra]
Something you should do after designing this
fancy new product of yours.
[Timerra]
Be sure to add your name in the title. You know,
like, "Lady Anna's Amazing Doodad."
[Anna]
Personal branding?! I don't know, that seems
a little embarrassing.
[Timerra]
Maybe. But if it turns out to be a hit...
[Timerra]
Your family might notice and get in touch
with you. Right?
[Anna]
Whoa. Princess Timerra...
[Anna]
You might have something there! If it works,
all the credit is yours.
