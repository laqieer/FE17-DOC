=== Alcryst & Seadall ===

[Alcryst]
Seadall? May I ask you about something?
[Seadall]
What would you like to know, Prince Alcryst?
[Alcryst]
I've heard that you were once part of a
traveling caravan.
[Alcryst]
Is that true?
[Seadall]
Yes. That's right.
[Seadall]
Merchants, performers, dancers... I've traveled
with them all and many more.
[Alcryst]
Really?! That must have been incredible!
[Seadall]
"Incredible"? That's a flattering description.
I'm surprised you think so.
[Alcryst]
Well, I've rarely traveled outside of Brodia.
My duties as a prince keep me so busy.
[Seadall]
I see.
[Alcryst]
I'm also a bit of an introvert... I envy those who
can navigate foreign cultures with ease.
[Seadall]
The world is full of wonders. The things I've
seen...some of it would take your breath away.
[Seadall]
In fact, if you're truly interested in that life,
I could tell you a story or three.
[Alcryst]
Really? I would enjoy that very much!
[Seadall]
Of course, if I tell you these tales, I will be
obliged to leave out some of the best bits.
[Seadall]
I can't be responsible for inspiring a prince to
go adventuring beyond his kingdom's walls.
[Alcryst]
Oh, no need to worry. I'm not that brave. I was
anxious just asking you a simple question.

[Alcryst]
That's amazing! Wolf jousting sounds like a
thrilling sport to witness.
[Seadall]
That it is.
[Seadall]
But it's the fights out in the crowd...hm, that's
where you'll find the real action.
[Seadall]
There are plenty of ways to amuse oneself in
Solm, but nothing is quite like the Wolf Arena.
[Alcryst]
So many stories... What a fascinating life you've
led, Seadall.
[Alcryst]
Your descriptions are so vivid. I feel as if I've
witnessed it all with my own eyes!
[Alcryst]
The caravan lifestyle sounds like so much fun.
[Alcryst]
Coming and going as you please, following your
own whims and curiosities all over the world.
[Alcryst]
No restrictions, no cares...and if you ever grow
bored, you can just set off on another journey.
[Alcryst]
I wish I could have that life...
[Seadall]
Yes, well...
[Alcryst]
There's one story you haven't told yet. When
did you first join the caravan?
[Alcryst]
I bet you were born into it. Am I close?
[Seadall]
No. I was born in a town by the sea.
It was...beautiful.
[Seadall]
I was so young when my father died, I have no
memories of him. My mother raised me.
[Seadall]
She was a fortune-teller, but...an ill-fated one.
She got sick and died when I was young.
[Seadall]
One thing led to another... Before long, I was
living on the streets.
[Alcryst]
On the streets? But why?
[Seadall]
I was a child without a family. Where else
would I live?
[Alcryst]
Oh...
[Seadall]
But one day a caravan was passing by. The
travelers called to me...invited me to join them.
[Seadall]
And I did. I traveled with them from that day on.
[Seadall]
Speaking was difficult for me then. Words were
hard. So my teacher taught me to dance.
[Seadall]
I learned that I didn't need words to
communicate. That saved me.
[Alcryst]
I see...
[Seadall]
Ah, my apologies. That story is not so amusing
as the others...
[Alcryst]
Please, I'm the one who should apologize.
I didn't think before broaching the subject.
[Seadall]
No, I've darkened the mood.
[Seadall]
I'm sorry. I think this is a good place to stop
for now. Another time, Prince Alcryst.

[Alcryst]
Seadall? I'd like to apologize once more for our
conversation the other day.
[Alcryst]
I really should have considered your feelings
before asking about your past...
[Seadall]
It didn't bother me, and you didn't do
anything wrong.
[Alcryst]
I've been thinking about your stories since then.
[Alcryst]
I had assumed the caravan lifestyle was all fun
and games...but that's not true, is it?
[Seadall]
No. Fun isn't the right word.
[Seadall]
That life can be brutal beyond compare.
I watched friends die during raids...and worse.
[Alcryst]
...
[Alcryst]
There must have been so many hardships...and
yet, I assumed it was a life of leisure.
[Alcryst]
If I had looked past my own desires for even a
moment before speaking... I really am sorry.
[Seadall]
Oh, Prince Alcryst...
[Seadall]
Like I said, you've done nothing wrong.
[Seadall]
Yes, bad things happened when I was traveling
with the caravan.
[Seadall]
But good things happened too. Many more
good things.
[Seadall]
The caravan was my family and my home.
I count myself lucky to have lived that life.
[Alcryst]
I'm very glad to hear that.
[Seadall]
So please, do not hesitate. Ask as many
questions as you like.
[Seadall]
Ask me about the strange and wonderful foods
I tasted for the first time at the border village.
[Seadall]
Or about the morning sun I watched set the sky
on fire as it rose over the desert oasis.
[Seadall]
There are so many questions I hope you ask.
And so many stories I hope to tell you.
[Alcryst]
Your tales mesmerize me, Seadall. I can't wait
to get lost in them again.
[Alcryst]
Please, tell me a new oneâ”€and another after
that! Tell me stories until the break of dawn.
[Seadall]
Haha... With pleasure, Prince Alcryst.
