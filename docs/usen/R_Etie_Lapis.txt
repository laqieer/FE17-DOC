=== Etie & Lapis ===

[Etie]
Hey, Lapis. Got a minute?
[Lapis]
Sure, Etie. What do you need?
[Etie]
They tell me you can build whatever you want.
Is that true?
[Lapis]
What? How did you hear that?
[Lapis]
I mean, I guess it's true. With the right materials,
I can make all kinds of stuff. Furniture, toys...
[Lapis]
I even made some instruments for a local
concert once. That was really fun.
[Etie]
That's amazing. Listen, I need a favor.
[Etie]
Would you build me a...muscle-training device?
[Lapis]
Like workout equipment? Wow. I've definitely
never built anything like that before.
[Etie]
For me, bodybuilding is life.
[Etie]
I've tried lots of training methods, but it's
getting harder to achieve my goals on my own.
[Lapis]
Oh, sure. I hate hitting that plateau where you
feel like you're not making any progress.
[Etie]
Exactly what I'm saying! I knew you'd get it.
[Lapis]
Which muscles do you want to focus on?
[Etie]
Hmm. My arms, chest, core, and my back.
That's all I'm looking for.
[Etie]
I'd repay you of course. Anything you want.
Think you could do this for me?
[Lapis]
Yeah! It'll be a challenge, but a fun one. I'll see
what I can put together.
[Etie]
Great. Oh, this is going to be incredible!

[Etie]
Lapis! How's that muscle-training device
coming along?
[Lapis]
Oh! Hey, Etie! Good timing. I was just making
some final adjustments.
[Lapis]
Introducing...the Muscle Maximizer Mark III!
[Etie]
Mark III?
[Lapis]
Yeah... It took a couple of tries to figure
things out.
[Lapis]
This one definitely holds up though. It'll work
your arms, chest, core, and back.
[Etie]
Wow, it's as good as I dreamed! So what's it
gonna cost me?
[Lapis]
Don't worry about that. I built this out of sticks
and spare parts, so there was no material cost.
[Etie]
Sticks and spare parts?! Unbelievable.
[Etie]
Well, I owe you for the labor at least. You've
gotta let me pay you back somehow.
[Etie]
But first...you mind if I try it out?
[Lapis]
Go for it!
[Etie]
Ugh... Ugh... Yesss!
[Etie]
The resistance settings are perfect! I can tell
you worked hard to get it just right.
[Etie]
This is exactly what I was hoping for!
[Lapis]
Yay! I'm so glad!
[Etie]
It's so good that I have to wonder if you're into
bodybuilding yourself.
[Lapis]
Kinda, but nothing fancy. I just lift rocks...like
that one. Or that big guy over there.
[Etie]
Those rocks? With your noodly arms?
[Etie]
How do you manage that? I can't picture it.
[Etie]
You'll have to tell me more about it sometime.
I have a feeling we're gonna be good friends.
[Lapis]
Really? I mean, OK! I'd like that a lot.

[Etie]
I meant to thank you for that thing you made.
It's been great for my weight training.
[Lapis]
That's great, Etie. I'm glad you're enjoying it.
[Lapis]
I actually feel a little guilty. You gave me all of
those Firenese tea leaves to pay me back.
[Etie]
Don't worry about it. Your Muscle Maximizer
Mark III was worth the entire crateload.
[Etie]
By the way, what's that you're eating?
Some kind of...potato?
[Lapis]
Ah! Th-these? Well, uh...
[Lapis]
OK. I'm actually from a small, country town in
Brodia. We grow tatersâ”€er, potatoes there.
[Lapis]
Sometimes my parents send me dried sweet-
potato slices from the farm. They're so good.
[Etie]
Dried potatoes? From a remote part of Brodia?
Is that what I think it is?
[Etie]
The high-calorie, low-fat starch that's every
musclehead's dream?!
[Lapis]
What? You've heard of these?
[Etie]
I had no idea where to find these things.
I never thought they'd fall into my lap.
[Lapis]
Would you like to try one?
[Etie]
Are you kidding me? Yes!
[Etie]
Yum!
[Etie]
Just one delicious bite completely eased my
muscle fatigue!
[Etie]
I might seriously cry, Lapis.
[Lapis]
Me too! I've never seen anyone else so in love
with our homegrown potatoes! I had no idea.
[Lapis]
Here, take some more! I have so many.
[Etie]
Are you sure you don't mind?!
[Lapis]
I don't mind at all!
[Etie]
You're too nice. I owe you so much for all this.
[Lapis]
Well, in that case, may I train with you?
[Lapis]
I'm pretty strong, but I start to droop if a battle
drags on and on.
[Lapis]
I'd love to build up my endurance. Maybe we
could go for runs together?
[Etie]
We can do that, no problem. For you, I'd jog
until my legs gave out.
[Etie]
We should try it with and without the potatoes
to see if they make a difference!
[Etie]
Who knows what kind of heights we can reach
together!
