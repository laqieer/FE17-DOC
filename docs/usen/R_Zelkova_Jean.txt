[Zelkov] 
Hello, Jean. You are an aspiring *doctor,* yes? 
Would you come here a moment?
[Jean] 
Huh? Yes, I'm studying to be a doctor. Why?
[Zelkov] 
You seem uneasy. Have I *startled* you?
[Zelkov] 
If so, please accept my apology. The last thing 
I would ever wish to do is *impart* fear.
[Zelkov] 
Shall I try starting over and greeting you again? 
Would it *help* if I sat down?
[Jean] 
Um, no. That's OK.
[Zelkov] 
Very well. Then please come *here* a moment. 
I would like to get your opinion.
[Jean] 
My opinion on what?
[Zelkov] 
These *medicines* I've made.
[Zelkov] 
Look here. I call this one the *azure elixir.*
[Jean] 
Azure elixir? What does it do?
[Zelkov] 
It settles painful pounding within the skull. 
Provides the *tranquility* of an azure sky.
[Jean] 
Oh... So it's a headache remedy.
[Zelkov] 
Indeed. And this is the *crimson tincture.* 
Apply it to end the red fury of damaged skin.
[Jean] 
In other words, an ointment.
[Jean] 
Azure elixir and crimson tincture, huh? That all 
sounds kind of...pretentious.
[Zelkov] 
What was that? I did not *hear* you.
[Jean] 
Nothing. Just talking to myself.
[Jean] 
These are amazing, though. You did good work 
here. You must be a skilled doctor.
[Zelkov] 
I *learned* the techniques from my mother, 
who was a trained physician.
[Zelkov] 
In any case, if these are *satisfactory,* then 
I would like to leave them with you.
[Jean] 
Thank you very much for the medicine, Zelkov. 
You're an unexpectedly good person.

[Jean] 
Thanks again for the medicine. It's helped a lot 
of people! They were all really grateful.
[Zelkov] 
I am pleased to hear that. My mother *deserves* 
the gratitude, since these were her recipes.
[Jean] 
Where is your mother? I'd like to thank 
her personally.
[Zelkov] 
That is not possible, I'm afraid. She has been 
*deceased* for more than a decade.
[Jean] 
Oh, I didn't realize. I'm sorry to bring it up.
[Zelkov] 
Do not trouble yourself.
[Zelkov] 
To care for a wretch like me took kindness 
above and beyond the usual standard.
[Zelkov] 
The light of her love had the power to cut 
through my darkest day.
[Jean] 
Mm...
[Zelkov] 
What is it?
[Jean] 
What you said reminds me of my own mother.
[Jean] 
She's a lot like yours. She always doted on me 
and made sure I knew I was loved.
[Zelkov] 
Have you *lost* a mother as well?
[Jean] 
Oh, no, she's still alive. Her hips are troubling 
her these days, though.
[Jean] 
I haven't been able to see her lately...
[Zelkov] 
It must be difficult to be *away* from her.
[Jean] 
Uh-huh. It's her birthday soon, and I don't know 
what I'll do this year.
[Jean] 
We always celebrate birthdays together, but this 
time it looks like we'll be apart.
[Zelkov] 
Perhaps you could write her a *letter*?
[Jean] 
Huh...
[Jean] 
Wonderful idea! Why didn't it occur to me? 
Thank you, Zelkov.
[Zelkov] 
No thanks needed. To see a child happy is 
sufficient *recompense* for me.

[Jean] 
So...I wrote a letter to my mother after we 
last spoke.
[Jean] 
I was thinking of sending it today, but I was 
hoping to run it by you first.
[Zelkov] 
Certainly. No *trouble* at all.
[Jean] 
Thank you. OK, here goes...
[Jean] 
"Dear Mother. Happy birthday! I hope the day 
finds you well.
[Jean] 
"Things are fine here. I did meet quite a... 
mysterious fellow recently."
[Zelkov] 
What? Who is this *mysterious* person?
[Jean] 
"The first time he talked to me, my knees began 
to shake as soon as he said, 'Come here.'
[Jean] 
"He smiled thinly as he approached, talking 
about how he didn't want to scare me.
[Jean] 
"'Well,' I thought, 'it's been a good life.'"
[Zelkov] 
Oh. You are talking about *me.*
[Jean] 
"But then I found out he's actually a very 
kind man."
[Zelkov] 
Ah...
[Jean] 
"He's the whole reason I'm writing this letter 
to you.
[Jean] 
"You always said, 'Don't judge a person before 
getting to know them,' and you were right.
[Jean] 
"Now that I'm living far from you, I realize how 
right you were about a lot of things.
[Jean] 
"I'm glad you're my mother. I hope you stay 
healthy for a long, long time.
[Jean] 
"I'll be home for your birthday next year. 
I promise. Give my love to Father.
[Jean] 
"Your son, Jean."
[Jean] 
And that's all. Not too weird for a birthday 
letter, is it?
[Zelkov] 
Of course not. I think it is absolutely *fitting.*
[Zelkov] 
I am surprised to be a *subject* in it, but I 
cannot say that I mind leaving an impression.
[Zelkov] 
Please, send this along to her as well. I call it 
the...*obsidian oil.*
[Jean] 
Obsidian this time?
[Zelkov] 
It is absorbed through the skin. It should 
soothe your mother's *ailing* hips.
[Jean] 
Thank you, Zelkov. For this, and for everything 
else you gave me.
[Zelkov] 
You can thank me by taking good care of her.
[Zelkov] 
I never had the opportunity to show my parents 
gratitude. I regret that every single day.
[Zelkov] 
Do not make the same mistake I did. Let them 
see how much you care while they are still here.
[Jean] 
I will, Zelkov. I'll be a good son for both of us.
[Zelkov] 
I appreciate it.
[Jean] 
And more than that, I'll be a good friend for 
you too.
[Jean] 
I hope you'll come find me the next time you're 
making medicine!
[Zelkov] 
That...means a great deal to me.
[Zelkov] 
I mean to say, I will *gladly* accept your offer.
[Zelkov] 
Thank you, Jean.
