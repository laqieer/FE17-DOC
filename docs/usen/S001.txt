(Tea-Field Village)
Can the Divine's Dragon army save
the residents of a peaceful village
when the Corrupted attack?

--- OP ---


[Jean's Father]
These pills ought to clear up the problem.
Let me know if the pain persists, OK?
[Jean's Father]
And you're looking chipper today! I told you
that cold would be gone before you know it.
[Jean]
Father, isn't it time you took a break? Look,
I made you some tea.
[Jean's Father]
Thank you, Jean. You didn't burn yourself or
anything preparing it, I hope.
[Jean]
You worry too much. I'm old enough to manage
a simple pot of tea, I assure you.
[Jean's Father]
Hm-hm, it makes me happy to see you growing
up so fine.
[Jean's Father]
Hm? What's going on out there?
[Villager young man] 3
[Villager young man]
Doctor! You have to help us! Monsters are on
the attack and people are getting hurt!
[Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Boss]
Raaargh! RAAARGH!
[Jean]
What the devil are those beasts?!
[Jean's Father]
This will get ugly. Jean, go and hide! I'll take
care of bringing people to the clinic.
[Jean's Father]
This way, everyone! If you're unhurt, then assist
someone who's injured! We must pull together!
[Jean]
I know Father told me to hide, but how can I?
I have to do my part too!


[Alear]
Oh no...
[Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Boss]
Rrraaaagh!
[Alear]
" [Villager young man]
Get moving! There's shelter at the clinic!
[Corrupted] [Boss]
$ [Jean's Father]
Keep your wits about you, everyone! I'll patch
you up once the crisis has passed.
[Jean's Father]
[Villager young man]

[Alear]
We can't stand idle with the Corrupted on the
loose. Let's save those villagers!


[Alear]
Are you all right?! Get to safety and leave the
Corrupted to us!
[Villager young woman]
You don't have to tell me twice! But there's still
a few left who didn't make it out in time.
[Alear]
We'll do everything in our power to save as
many of them as we can.
[Villager young woman]
They'll love you for it if you do. You're their
last hope at this point!

* [Villager young woman]
Unbelievable! All the monsters are gone!
$ [Villager young man]
Smile
[Villager young man]
We're saved! And it's thanks to the lot of you.
[Villager young woman]

[Alear]
I'm glad no one got hurt. I was a little
worried there.
[Villager young man]
$ [Villager young woman]
Smile
[Villager young woman]
You can't know what this means to us. We
decided to give you this to show our thanks.

* [Villager young woman]
Are all the monsters really gone?
$ [Villager young man]
Smile
[Villager young man]
There were a few casualties, but at least we're
safe now. We owe you for that.
[Villager young woman]

[Alear]
I don't know if you should be thanking me. If I'd
acted faster, I could have saved more lives.
[Villager young man]
$ [Villager young woman]
Smile
[Villager young woman]
We're grateful for your help! This isn't much,
but we hope you'll accept it.

" [Villager young woman]
Aah... My husband! Where is my husband?!
[Villager girl]
Aww, Daddy!
[Villager young woman]

[Alear]
I let this village down today. I wasn't fast
enough, and now so many are gone...
[Villager girl]
[Jean's Father]
You still tried, even though you're a stranger
here. That's...something, I suppose.


[Jean's Father] 3
[Jean's Mother] 4
[Jean]
Hmm...
[Jean's Father]
Come now, Jean. Give the nice people a proper
thank-you.
[Jean]
Oh, right. Thank you for saving our village.


[Alear]
We saved it together. You did well today, Jean.
[Jean]
Oh! I introduced myself to you, but I never
asked your name, did I?
[Alear]
Well, there was a lot going on. I'm the
Divine Dragon .
[Jean]
The Divine Dragon?! From the land of Lythos?!
Oh, please forgive my rudeness!
[Alear]
Don't mention it. Like I said, there was a lot
going on at the time.
[Jean's Father]
What brings such a splendid personage to
our humble village?
[Alear]
I've been on a journey to defeat the Fell Dragon
and bring peace to the world.
[Jean]
The whole world? Wow. If it's all right with
you, Divine One, can I come along and help?!
[Jean's Father]
Jean! What's gotten into you?!
[Jean]
My dream has always been to become a doctor
so I can save people. And that hasn't changed.
[Jean]
But with monsters running rampant, I might die
before I can do that. Look what just happened!
[Jean]
At the Divine Dragon's side, I think I can learn
to fight and to heal people at the same time.
[Jean's Father]
That's all very well for you, but what about
the Divine Dragon? You'd just be a burden.
[Alear]
Oh, I wouldn't say that. Not if what he did
during that battle is anything to go by.
[Alear]
If Jean wants to come, I don't mind. Though I
understand why you'd be worried.
[Jean's Mother]
Well, if he has your permission, then... I can only
ask that you take good care of my boy.
[Jean's Father]
What? You're actually allowing him to go?
[Jean]
Father, I told you, you don't need to worry
about me. It's not like I'm never coming home.
In fact, when I do return, I'll be a first-rate
doctor. You'll see!
[Jean's Father]
How quickly they grow up...
[Jean's Father]
Of course, Jean. Be a good boy, a hard worker,
and an attentive student. And come home safe.
[Jean]
I will! Thank you, both of you. I can't wait to
start working alongside the Divine Dragon!
[Alear]
The feeling is mutual, Jean. I have a hunch that
I'll be leaning on you a lot in the days to come.

" [Jean's Father]
There are so many wounded we couldn't get to
the clinic... Is it up to me to treat them all?!

[Jean]
Father, I'm here to help! If we split up, we can
treat everyone!
* [Jean's Father]
Jean?! I thought I told you to run and hide!
[Jean]
I can't stay hidden away when there are so
many who need my help!
[Jean]
After all, Father, am I not your son? You taught
me that a doctor does whatever is needed!
$ [Jean's Father]
Relax
[Jean's Father]
My lessons have sunk in, I see. Very well, then!
Come and give me a hand!

[Villager visitor]
Don't know how much use you'll get out of
this, but every little bit helps, right?

[Jean's Mother]
Thank you for checking in on me. Do you think
you could use this?
[Jean's Mother]
There's not much I can do with it, at any rate.
Better it should go to a soldier like yourself.

* [Jean's Mother]
Jean, get inside this instant! It's too dangerous
to─ What? You're helping out the village?
[Jean's Mother]
Well, if I can't change your mind, then you
should have this. And Jean...come home safe.


[Alear]
It's not safe here! You should be running!
[Jean]
I can't. I'm the local doctor's son. I won't leave
until I've helped the injured!

[Alear]
Huh... You've got a lot of heart for a kid
your age.

[Alear]
All right. Let's join forces and save
those villagers!
[Jean]
I really appreciate the help. My name's Jean.
Now come on─there's work to do!

[Jean]
You're going to have to do more than that to
scare me off!

$ [Jean's Father]
You monster! I'll show you that the people of
this village won't be pushed around!

[Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Boss]
Raaargh...

[Corrupted] [Corrupted] [Boss]
AAAGH!

" [Jean's Father]
I know when I'm too injured to fight anymore.
Time to go and treat my own wounds...


--- DIE ---

[Jean]
This is a deep wound... I'd better retreat while
I still can.

[Jean]
Father... I'm sorry... I couldn't live up to
your example...
