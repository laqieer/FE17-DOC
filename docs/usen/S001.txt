These pills ought to clear up the problem. 
Let me know if the pain persists, OK?
[Jean] 父親 
And you're looking chipper today! I told you 
that cold would be gone before you know it.
[Jean] 
Father, isn't it time you took a break? Look, 
I made you some tea.
[Jean] 父親 
Thank you, Jean. You didn't burn yourself or 
anything preparing it, I hope.
[Jean] 
You worry too much. I'm old enough to manage 
a simple pot of tea, I assure you.
[Jean] 父親 
Hm-hm, it makes me happy to see you growing 
up so fine.
[Jean] 父親 
Hm? What's going on out there?

Doctor! You have to help us! Monsters are on 
the attack and people are getting hurt!

Raaargh! RAAARGH!
[Jean] 
What the devil are those beasts?!
[Jean] 父親 
This will get ugly. Jean, go and hide! I'll take 
care of bringing people to the clinic.
[Jean] 父親 
This way, everyone! If you're unhurt, then assist 
someone who's injured! We must pull together!
[Jean] 
I know Father told me to hide, but how can I? 
I have to do my part too!

You don't have to tell me twice! But there's still 
a few left who didn't make it out in time.
[Alear] 
We'll do everything in our power to save as 
many of them as we can.
[Villager] 青年女 
They'll love you for it if you do. You're their 
last hope at this point!

[Jean] 父親 
Come now, Jean. Give the nice people a proper 
thank-you.
[Jean] 
Oh, right. Thank you for saving our village.
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
We saved it together. You did well today, Jean.
[Jean] 
Oh! I introduced myself to you, but I never 
asked your name, did I?
[Alear] 
Well, there was a lot going on. I'm the 
Divine Dragon .
[Jean] 
The Divine Dragon?! From the land of Lythos?! 
Oh, please forgive my rudeness!
[Alear] 
Don't mention it. Like I said, there was a lot 
going on at the time.
[Jean] 父親 
What brings such a splendid personage to 
our humble village?
[Alear] 
I've been on a journey to defeat the Fell Dragon 
and bring peace to the world.
[Jean] 
The whole world? Wow. If it's all right with 
you, Divine One, can I come along and help?!
[Jean] 父親 
Jean! What's gotten into you?!
[Jean] 
My dream has always been to become a doctor 
so I can save people. And that hasn't changed.
[Jean] 
But with monsters running rampant, I might die 
before I can do that. Look what just happened!
[Jean] 
At the Divine Dragon's side, I think I can learn 
to fight and to heal people at the same time.
[Jean] 父親 
That's all very well for you, but what about 
the Divine Dragon? You'd just be a burden.
[Alear] 
Oh, I wouldn't say that. Not if what he did 
during that battle is anything to go by.
[Alear] 
If Jean wants to come, I don't mind. Though I 
understand why you'd be worried.
[Jean] 母親 
Well, if he has your permission, then... I can only 
ask that you take good care of my boy.
[Jean] 父親 
What? You're actually allowing him to go?
[Jean] 
Father, I told you, you don't need to worry 
about me. It's not like I'm never coming home.
In fact, when I do return, I'll be a first-rate 
doctor. You'll see!
[Jean] 父親 
How quickly they grow up...
[Jean] 父親 
Of course, Jean. Be a good boy, a hard worker, 
and an attentive student. And come home safe.
[Jean] 
I will! Thank you, both of you. I can't wait to 
start working alongside the Divine Dragon!
[Alear] 
The feeling is mutual, Jean. I have a hunch that 
I'll be leaning on you a lot in the days to come.
