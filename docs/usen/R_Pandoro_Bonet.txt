=== Pandreo & Bunet ===

[Bunet]
Ah, what a delicious aroma. It smells so fresh
and so...green.
[Pandreo]
Yeah, I love the smell of fresh-cut grass!
[Pandreo]
Phew! Looks like that's the last of the weeds
in the Somniel.
[Pandreo]
Which means we're done with our Sentinel
duties for the day.
[Bunet]
Does weeding really count as Sentinel duty?
[Pandreo]
Sure, why not? If we do it, that's what it is!
[Pandreo]
Bandits may not come around here, but the
Somniel still needs protecting.
[Bunet]
Hm, yes. We have to defend it from the
merciless onslaught of...weeds.
[Pandreo]
Oh! Bunet, old pal. Don't forget I'm counting on
you to make food for the party.
[Bunet]
Leave it to me. As always, I will prepare a
flawless banquet.
[Pandreo]
That's what I like to hear. You're a man among
men, you know that?
[Bunet]
Think nothing of it. I am glad for any chance to
hone my culinary skills.
[Pandreo]
Oh, that reminds me. I heard there's gonna be
a famous food critic there.
[Bunet]
Really?!
[Pandreo]
Yeah! It might be a good chance to show her
what you can do.
[Bunet]
Interesting... In that case, I will prepare an
innovative new dish for the occasion.
[Bunet]
Something that is sure to set the food critic's
eyes alight. Be sure to watch for her reaction.
[Pandreo]
Why don't you come see it for yourself?
[Bunet]
I dislike parties. Too noisy, I find. Like a dish
with many strong flavors all at once.
[Pandreo]
Ah, too bad. I guess that's the price you pay for
those acute senses of yours.
[Bunet]
Just report back to me afterward. That is all
I ask.
[Pandreo]
You got it, good buddy! Can't wait to taste the
grub you whip up!

[Bunet]
Pandreo, how was the party?
[Bunet]
Did the critic appreciate my cooking?
[Pandreo]
Oh, uh, yeah. She was very impressed, but...
[Bunet]
But?
[Pandreo]
Well, to be honest, it wasn't that popular with
anyone else.
[Bunet]
What? But I sampled it myself. The flavor
was heavenly.
[Pandreo]
Oh, don't get me wrong. It tasted great.
[Pandreo]
It was just a little too...gourmet. Party food's
gotta be easy to pick up and walk around with.
[Bunet]
What?! Why?!
[Pandreo]
You know, people like to mingle while they eat.
This felt like a stuffy dinner at the royal court.
[Pandreo]
I should have said something. I-I know you
haven't been to many parties, after all.
[Bunet]
...
[Pandreo]
Don't beat yourself up, though. It's not like
people didn't eat it.
[Bunet]
A chef's sacred duty is to make the right food
for the occasion...and I failed.
[Bunet]
I made something far worse than a bad dish.
I made...the wrong dish.
[Pandreo]
Bunet, it's not like that.
[Bunet]
I am your friend and I let you down. A mere
apology will not suffice. Please, strike me.
[Pandreo]
What?! No! You went to so much trouble
making that food. I'm not gonna hit you!
[Bunet]
I ruined your party, and still you find it in your
heart to forgive me... You are a true friend.
[Bunet]
Pandreo, when is your next get-together?
[Pandreo]
Looking to redeem yourself, huh?
[Bunet]
No. At least, not yet. Before redeeming myself,
there is something I must do.
[Bunet]
I must attend...a party.
[Pandreo]
Whaaat?!

[Pandreo]
Hey, Bunet! What did you think of the party?
Pretty fun, right?
[Bunet]
Ugh...
[Pandreo]
Oof. That bad, huh?
[Bunet]
Forgive me... The noise was overwhelming.
My head is still spinning.
[Pandreo]
Oh, I see. That's probably my fault.
[Bunet]
I will say, everyone was in high spirits. Even in
times like these, good cheer abounded.
[Pandreo]
That's the magic of a good shindig! But how
about you? Learn anything?
[Bunet]
Certainly. I came away with many insights.
[Bunet]
I noticed that you spent most of the time simply
listening to people share their troubles.
[Pandreo]
Well, sure! My parties aren't all about me.
I want to help people feel better, you know?
[Pandreo]
After all, though I may look like a run-of-the-mill
scoundrel, I am a man of the cloth!
[Bunet]
Yes... Now I see the error I made. I wanted my
cooking to steal the show.
[Bunet]
But good party food lets the conversation take
center stage.
[Bunet]
Headache aside, I'm glad I went. Next time I will
cook the perfect dish for you and your guests.
[Pandreo]
That would be great! Thanks, Bunet.
[Pandreo]
And hey, let me know if there's anything I can
do to help. Anything at all.
[Bunet]
Well, there is one thing you can do.
[Bunet]
Let me give you one little lick.
[Pandreo]
One little WHAT?!
[Pandreo]
Um. Uh, you're kidding, right?
[Bunet]
No. I'm quite serious.
[Bunet]
I must understand your festive spirit in order to
capture it in my cooking.
[Bunet]
Now, roll up your sleeve. It'll be quick. No need
to be nervous.
[Pandreo]
Uh... Hehe...
[Bunet]
Pandreo? Is something the matter?
[Pandreo]
I've been to some wild parties in my day, but...
[Pandreo]
That's a bit too far, even for me!
