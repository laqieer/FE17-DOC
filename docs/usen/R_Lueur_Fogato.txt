[Alear] 
Fogado, I want to thank you and the Sentinels 
for your hard work today.
[Fogado] 
Haha, hard? That was nothin'.
[Fogado] 
We didn't have to resolve a single quarrel, and 
there were barely any Corrupted around.
[Fogado] 
I only wish every day was like this.
[Alear] 
You're so easy-going...all the time. That must be 
why your people love you so much.
[Alear] 
As your ally, I certainly enjoy working with 
someone so unflappable.
[Fogado] 
Unflappable, eh? Ooo, I think I feel a blush 
coming on.
[Fogado] 
But thanks for the compliment. How about we 
grab dinner together sometime?
[Alear] 
Dinner?
[Fogado] 
Yeah! You, me, and some hard-hitting questions. 
Like...who is your very best friend and why?
[Alear] 
Um, that's pretty personal.
[Fogado] 
You could tell me a super-secret wish─you 
know, one you're too embarrassed to reveal.
[Alear] 
No! That's even worse.
[Alear] 
Look, as much as I enjoy your devil-may-care 
attitude, the banter is a bit much.
[Fogado] 
You'd rather I be all boring and serious? Nah. 
I wouldn't be me if I wasn't a rascal.
[Alear] 
I suppose you're right. It is hard to imagine you 
without that carefree personality of yours.
[Alear] 
It may be your most likable trait.

[Fogado] 
Whew. Guess I should call it a day.
[Alear] 
You know, for a self-proclaimed rascal, you sure 
seem devoted to working out.
[Fogado] 
Huh?! How long have you been standing there?!
[Alear] 
Long enough. I bet the Sentinels would be 
inspired if they knew how hard you trained.
[Fogado] 
No, they wouldn't. And you're going to keep 
your trap shut about what you saw here today.
[Alear] 
Why? Training isn't something to be 
embarrassed about.
[Fogado] 
It's not that. I just have a reputation to 
maintain, OK?
[Fogado] 
Everyone thinks I'm so easy-going. I gotta make 
sure it stays that way so people stay happy.
[Alear] 
I'm...not following.
[Fogado] 
If the Sentinels saw how hard I work to get in 
fighting shape, they'd stress over keeping up.
[Fogado] 
Worry, fear, exhaustion─that stuff is 
contagious, you know.
[Fogado] 
Hence the unfailing good cheer. It's on me to 
stay positive and upbeat for everyone.
[Alear] 
Wow. I guess I had you all wrong. I'm sorry.
[Alear] 
As you said, I'll keep my trap shut.
[Fogado] 
Thanks, Divine One. I appreciate that.
[Alear] 
You are certainly full of surprises, Fogado.

[Alear] 
Well, well. Training hard again, I see.
[Fogado] 
Divine One, what are you doing here?!
[Fogado] 
I thought you agreed to forget what you saw. 
So, why did you come back?
[Alear] 
I'm sorry.
[Alear] 
It's just, you've been training so hard and in 
secret... I thought you could use some company.
[Fogado] 
Hahaha! The Divine One worrying about me? 
How'd I get so lucky?
[Alear] 
Fogado, I'd like to do something nice for you.
[Fogado] 
Eh, I appreciate the gesture, but I'm kind of 
a prince, so there's really not much I need.
[Alear] 
How about that dinner you wanted? Let's have 
a meal and get to know each other better.
[Fogado] 
You want to have dinner? And, uh, eat it 
together?
[Alear] 
I do.
[Fogado] 
I can't say I'm not tempted. I mean, dinner with 
a dragon! But...
[Fogado] 
I can't right now. Sorry.
[Alear] 
You're turning me down? Ouch.
[Fogado] 
No, no! It's just...dinner with you is like the 
ultimate reward, and I haven't earned it yet.
[Fogado] 
I want to keep that carrot dangling for a while─ 
give myself something to strive for.
[Alear] 
I see. I just hope it lives up to your expectations. 
I'll be ready when you are.
[Fogado] 
Thanks. Well then, it's back to work for me.
[Fogado] 
Bringing the best banter in Solm to the 
Sentinels─and to my people!

[Alear] 
The food was incredible, Fogado. And the 
restaurant was superb as well.
[Fogado] 
Yep, dinner with a dragon was everything I 
hoped it would be. Well worth the wait, for sure.
[Alear] 
There's so much going on, I'm just glad we 
could make this meal together happen.
[Fogado] 
...
[Fogado] 
There is something else I wish we could 
make happen.
[Alear] 
There is? Hmm, is it a super-secret wish you're 
too embarrassed to reveal, perhaps?
[Fogado] 
No, no, nothing like that.
[Fogado] 
Actually, maybe it kind of is. My wish is...well...
[Fogado] 
Divine One, I wish we could be allies from 
here on out, you know? I mean, forever.
[Alear] 
You do?! Well, huh...
[Fogado] 
This isn't rascal talk. This is serious talk. I've 
never worked so hard to earn a dinner!
[Alear] 
I didn't know you felt like this. I really didn't.
[Fogado] 
I wasn't planning to tell you. I figured I'd just 
keep it a secret forever.
[Alear] 
You do seem to like your secrets.
[Alear] 
How many secrets do you have? For all I know, 
you've asked everyone to be your ally forever.
[Fogado] 
No! No way! I'm careful about who I keep close. 
You're the only one I've ever asked.
[Alear] 
Haha, I'm kidding. I just wanted to give you 
a hard time.
[Alear] 
I know the easy-going rascal isn't all there is to 
you. I see how solid and genuine you really are.
[Alear] 
That's why I want you to have this.
[Fogado] 
The Pact Ring? But, Divine One, this means...
[Alear] 
It means I can grant your super-secret wish. If 
you want to be allies for all time, I do too.
[Alear] 
I guess I like my secrets too, because I've been 
thinking about this for quite a while, Fogado.
[Fogado] 
Really? I'm so honored and just plain...happy!
[Alear] 
Good. And so you know, I think the real Fogado 
is amazing. You can always be you with me.
[Fogado] 
Thank you, .
[Fogado] 
I promise, this easy-going rascal will be your 
solid and genuine ally for all time.
