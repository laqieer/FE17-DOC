=== Alear & Ivy ===

[Ivy]
...
[Alear]
Oh, Ivy. Did you need something from me?
[Ivy]
No, Divine One.
[Ivy]
Must I require something to remain near you?
[Alear]
No, it's not that...
[Ivy]
I see. Then please feel free to ignore me.
[Alear]
I would, but...it's difficult to ignore the anger
on your face.
[Ivy]
...
[Alear]
The kingdom of Elusia worships the Fell
Dragon, doesn't it?
[Alear]
If that's the case, I can certainly see why you
would feel uncomfortable around me.
[Ivy]
You can't imagine how I feel.
[Alear]
If you can explain it, I'd love to understand.
[Alear]
It might reduce this...distance between us.
[Ivy]
True.
[Ivy]
But we should...get used to each other first.
We'll talk when we're...more comfortable.
[Ivy]
For now, I will leave you be...
[Ivy]
and worship from afar.
[Alear]
Worship?

[Ivy]
...
[Alear]
Ivy, do you think maybe it's time we talked?
[Alear]
Whatever you're feeling toward me, I'm
prepared to listen.
[Alear]
As allies, I'd like there not to be walls
between us.
[Ivy]
Very well.
[Ivy]
I am rather more comfortable around you now,
so...I suppose it's time.
[Alear]
I'm glad to hear that.
[Alear]
Can we start with why you seem to have such
anger toward me?
[Ivy]
I love you.
[Alear]
Huh?
[Ivy]
I love you, Divine One. My feelings began long
before I met you.
[Ivy]
Understand, I...do not mean romantically.
I adore you as a worshipper adores a deity.
[Alear]
But...you looked so upset when you were
staring at me before.
[Ivy]
My deity was standing before me, in the flesh.
I was nervous.
[Alear]
Oh...
[Ivy]
Do you understand now?
[Alear]
Yes, um... Thank you for sharing that.
[Alear]
I, um, like you as well, Ivy.
[Ivy]
Yes...
[Ivy]
May I be excused?
[Alear]
Oh. Yes. Yes, of course. And...
[Alear]
And...I'm sorry.
[Ivy]
We'll speak again later, Divine One.

[Alear]
Ivy, can I ask why you call me your deity?
[Ivy]
During all the hardest moments of my life, the
one thing I could turn to was the Divine Dragon.
[Ivy]
My faith in you gave me strength to survive.
[Alear]
Survive what, exactly?
[Ivy]
My whole world─the place where I was born.
[Ivy]
Elusia Castle is a den of treachery and
double-dealing. No one is safe there.
[Ivy]
And the worst part is...I had no escape.
[Ivy]
My mother was at the center of every scheme.
I was forced to be near every foul conspiracy.
[Alear]
Your own mother...
[Ivy]
In her world, every smile is a dagger looking for
a back to stab.
[Ivy]
I hated that place. I hated what it did to
everyone who set foot there.
[Ivy]
The one thing that kept me from despair was
my faith─my faith in the Divine Dragon.
[Alear]
But why me?
[Ivy]
At first I worshipped merely to be contrary.
They chose the Fell Dragon, so I chose Divine.
[Ivy]
It was a small, invisible act of rebellion. But it
was what I needed.
[Ivy]
The more I thought about you and your life,
the more I knew I didn't belong in the castle.
[Alear]
I'm glad to have been some help, if only
indirectly.
[Ivy]
Ah, forgive me─to experience your kindness in
such a familiar way is an intense thing for me.
[Ivy]
Could you please act a little more like a deity?
[Alear]
Heh, understood. I'll try to be more considerate.
[Ivy]
In all seriousness, Divine One...
[Ivy]
You are my strength, even now. Thank you.

[Ivy]
This is where you wanted to meet, Divine One?
[Ivy]
Why all the way out here? What could you
possibly be planning?
[Alear]
I have something important to talk to you about.
[Ivy]
That doesn't explain why you picked this place.
I would happily speak with you anywhere.
[Alear]
I wanted to be alone with you.
[Ivy]
I see.
[Ivy]
Well, here we are.
[Alear]
Are you OK? You're blushing.
[Ivy]
I am? Of course I am.
[Ivy]
It's all right. Whatever you have to say to me,
I am prepared to hear it.
[Ivy]
Proceed.
[Alear]
Very well.
[Alear]
Princess Ivy, please accept this ring as a token
of my favor.
[Ivy]
That's the Pact Ring.
[Ivy]
The Divine Dragon bestows this gift only to
deepen the most meaningful bond.
[Alear]
Knowledgeable as ever.
[Ivy]
You're really giving this to me?
[Alear]
There is no one I would rather have by my side.
[Alear]
You are the one I feel closest to.
[Ivy]
I am, as ever, in awe of how forthright you are
with your feelings.
[Alear]
I wouldn't be a very good deity if I hid my
thoughts from someone so devoted to me.
[Alear]
You opened your heart to me, Ivy. It's only fair
I return the favor.
[Ivy]
That's true.
[Ivy]
Very well. In that case, I accept.
[Alear]
Good.
[Ivy]
I already feel so much closer to you.
[Ivy]
A bond with the Divine Dragon is more than I
ever dared hope for. Thank you, .
[Ivy]
Now and forever, you have my endless
devotion and adoration.
