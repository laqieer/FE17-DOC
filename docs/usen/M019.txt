[Zephia] 
I have returned.
[Marni] 
Heya, Zephia! How'd the report to Lord 
Sombron go?
[Griss] 
Bet he was mad we lost the rings, huh?
[Zephia] 
Very.
[Griss] 
Ahaha, knew it! So, he's gonna punish us, 
right? Finally, yes!
[Zephia] 
In fact, no. It was a scolding, nothing more. 
He impressed upon me the gravity of our role.
[Marni] 
That's all? Hah! He must really love us.
Feels good to be appreciated!
[Zephia] 
Has Lady Veyle woken up yet?
[Mauvier] 
No. That spell you keep casting on her... 
This is getting reckless.
We should dispense with the magic for now. 
Allow her to return to normal.
[Zephia] 
The spell will soon have a more stable effect. 
Lord Sombron gave me an enchanted helmet.
[Mauvier] 
What?
[Zephia] 
For her to wear. A helmet imbued with his 
power that will amplify the spell I cast on her.
Finally, I can erase the defect from existence. 
I intend to use it shortly.
I would like to have some good news for my 
next meeting with Lord Sombron.
[Griss] 
Speaking of news, our warships ran into the 
Divine Dragon's forces.
No luck stopping 'em. Sounds like they're 
sailing to Elusia as we speak.
[Zephia] 
Huh... Moving faster than I expected.
[Griss] 
Yeah. Only a matter of time before they're 
knocking at our door.
[Marni] 
Ooo! Want me to buy us some time? I can do it!
[Zephia] 
Of course, dear. So good of you to volunteer. 
But I can't have you going all alone.
Mauvier. You'll accompany her, won't you?
[Mauvier] 4 
[Mauvier] 
Very well.
[Marni] 
What? Why? I'd be fine on my own!
[Zephia] 
You are good, of course. But you'd achieve 
even greater success with Mauvier at your side.
[Marni] 
Well, OK! All the more praise for me then, right?
[Mauvier] 
Zephia, I ask one thing. Wait to cast your spell 
on Veyle again until we return.
[Zephia] 
All right, Mauvier.
[Mauvier] 
Then we depart.
[Marni] 
We'll be back before you know it!
[Mauvier] 
[Marni] 
[Zephia] 
Hmm...
[Griss] 
Ugh, Mauvier. He's way too attached to that 
other Veyle.
[Zephia] 
Truly. But it doesn't matter at the moment. 
And won't, as long as he stays in his place.
The Four Hounds are my family. I will always 
love Mauvier. Always. As long as he obeys.
Now, we have a serious matter to discuss─what 
Lady Veyle said about having a sibling...
[Griss] 
Right, right... That dragonstone of hers─ 
something about it being whole, not broken.
[Zephia] 
Yes, exactly. We need to look into that. 
The situation bears...examination.

[Alear] 
Here we are, Givre Port. I expected it to be 
better defended. We just sailed right in.
[Ivy] 
Hmm...
[Alear] 
What's wrong?
[Ivy] 
This is a port town. It's typically bustling with 
people. Why is it so quiet?
[Alear] 
I see someone over there. Maybe they can 
tell us.
[Ivy] 
Divine One, wait, that's...

[Alear] 
One of the Corrupted!
[Ivy] 
Yes, and surely not the only one here.
[Alear] 
You're right. They must have spread through 
the whole town, which means...
[Ivy] 
I'm afraid so.
[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
Does the Fell Dragon mean to destroy Elusia 
too? But that makes no sense.
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
All I know is we can't turn a blind eye. We've 
got to get rid of them.
[Alear] 
No, we move on.
[Diamant] 

[Timerra] 3 

[Timerra] 
What? And abandon the people here? Princess 
Ivy, tell us what you want to do.
[Ivy] 
We leave this place.
[Alfred] 
But there are people in danger. We have a 
responsibility to help them.
That's what we did at Florra, isn't it?
[Alear] 
We got there right after the attack. There were 
people to save.
Look around. We're too late... Far too late.
There aren't any survivors.
[Alfred] 
...
[Ivy] 
I would have wished nothing more than to help 
the people here.
But with every passing moment, more lives may 
be lost elsewhere.
We cannot waste our time on the dead. 
We must protect the living.
[Timerra] 
This is terrible...
[Alfred] 
I don't think I could abandon a town like this, 
but...it's not my decision.
[Timerra] 
[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
You'd already recognized the choice Princess 
Ivy would make, Divine One? Impressive.
[Alear] 
Hm? No, that was...
[Ivy] 
Thank you for your support, Divine One. 
Now, to the castle.
[Ivy] 

[Alear] 
[Marni] 1 
[Marni] 
Aww! You're gonna cut and run, just like that?
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Who's there?!
[Marni] 
Hello! It's me, your old pal Marni! Oh, and 
Mauvier's here too.
[Mauvier] 3 
[Mauvier] 
We meet again.
[Marni] 
I really wish you'd decided to stay and fight 
the Corrupted. Woulda been so much easier!
But the Divine Chicken's afraid of them. Bawk, 
bawk, bawk! Isn't that right?
[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
The Divine Dragon was thinking only of what's 
best for everyone.
[Marni] 
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just shut up, will ya? 
You're annoying me.
You guessed right─the port fell a long time ago. 
But I won't let you just walk away.
Wait, how's this for a deal? Drop your Emblem 
Rings and you can go.
[Alear] 
I don't think so.
[Marni] 
I figured. Worth a shot though, right? Well, time 
to fight, then!
And don't worry. We brought lots and lots of 
the Corrupted, just for you!
[Alear] 
Tell me one thing first. Please, I need to know.
[Marni] 
What?
[Alear] 
Veyle... Is she all right?
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle... She─
[Marni] 
Shush, Mauvier. We didn't come here to 
blab secrets.
'Fraid we can't answer that, Divine One. 
Our lips are sealed.
Tell you what. When this is over, I'll whisper 
it into your dead, little ears. How's that?
[Alear] 
We'd hoped to learn whatever we could from 
the people of this town.
But with no one left alive, we're glad to get the 
truth out of you, one way or another.

[Marni] 
Rings... They took the rings...
[Mauvier] 
Marni, we must retreat! Now!
[Marni] 
I can't go back! I'm just gonna get an earful 
from Lord Sombron. Or worse...Zephia!
[Mauvier] 
And after all your nonsense about being exempt 
from scolding. Now, let's hurry to Lady Veyle.
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Wait, tell me! Is Veyle all right?
[Mauvier] 
Lord Sombron has given Zephia a new kind of 
magic to use on Lady Veyle. If she does...
the true Lady Veyle will never awaken again.
[Alear] 
...
[Mauvier] 
The others think this is a happy outcome. But 
I... I have always worried for her safety.
[Alear] 
You really do want to protect her, don't you?
[Mauvier] 
I have said too much. Marni, I am returning now, 
with or without you.
[Mauvier] 
[Marni] 
You can't just leave m─ Hey, wait up!
[Marni] 

[Alear]

[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
Is it a good idea to just let them go?
[Alear] 
We took back the rings. Besides...
I have a feeling that Veyle is going to need 
him right at her side.

[Alear] 
Emblem Micaiah, Emblem Roy... Glad to finally 
have you back with us.
[Micaiah] 
I never lost faith that we would return to you. 
Thank you, .
On the Shadowy Moor, and at Florra Port, it 
pained me to fight against you.
[Alear] 
I'm sorry for putting you through that. I promise 
to never let that happen again.
I can't believe there are so many of the 
Corrupted in Elusia...
[Roy] 
The Fell Dragon is behind the rise of the 
Corrupted in this kingdom.
Sovereign blood is no longer enough for him. 
He's abducting the people of Elusia.
When Sombron drains them, they turn into the 
Corrupted. That's why they're everywhere.
[Alear] 
You mean the Corrupted we killed were...
[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
...
Solm, Brodia, Firene─they'll all suffer if the 
Corrupted leave my kingdom. We must act now.
If any of my people still remain, I must do all 
I can to save them.
[Alear] 
Those two came all the way here to stop us 
from reaching Elusia Castle.
The Four Hounds must be desperate to keep 
us at bay. Let's find out why.

Why'd the Divine Dragon dock here? The place
