[Chloé] 
Oh, hello, Merrin!
[Merrin] 
Well hello, Chloé. You're looking beautiful, 
as always.
[Merrin] 
You know, I saw these blossoms and 
immediately thought of you.
[Merrin] 
One beauty deserves another. I hope you 
like them.
[Chloé] 
Wow... That's really sweet of you, Merrin.
[Chloé] 
You're so charming and cool...like a knight out 
of a fairy tale.
[Merrin] 
Me? Charming and cool?
[Merrin] 
Haha, you're much too kind.
[Merrin] 
Hey, I happen to have some sweets. They're 
delicious. Care to share them with me?
[Chloé] 
Aww, what a nice surprise! I would love to.
[Merrin] 
Today is shaping up to be a fine day, indeed.
[Chloé] 
Let's sit over there, with the nice view. We can 
share your sweets and my pickled fish guts.
[Merrin] 
Sorry, did you say pickled...guts?
[Chloé] 
I bet you they'll go perfectly with the sweets.
[Merrin] 
Eh, I'm not so sure about that. Honestly, the 
combination sounds fairly wretched.
[Chloé] 
You never know until you try, though.
[Merrin] 
Perhaps just one bite, if you insist. But if I get 
an upset stomach, you have to take care of me.
[Chloé] 
I'd be happy to. Shall we brave the unknown 
together, Merrin?

[Merrin] 
HA!
[Merrin] 
Hahaha, well, well. I landed that finishing blow 
beautifully, if I do say so myself.
[Merrin] 
Still, more practice is in order. Perfection is the 
only option on the battlefield.
[Merrin] 
Ha-AH!
[Merrin] 
Whoa! What the─
[Merrin] 
AHH!
[Chloé] 1 
[Chloé] 
Oh no, Merrin! Are you OK?!
[Merrin] 
Chloé? How long have you been watching me?
[Chloé] 
Quite a while now.
[Chloé] 
I would've said something sooner, but I didn't 
want to interrupt your training.
[Merrin] 
Ugh... I wish you hadn't seen me looking so... 
so uncool!
[Merrin] 
Knights never make such sloppy mistakes in 
fairy tales. I'm sure you're disenchanted now.
[Chloé] 
Aw, it's OK, Merrin. Uh-oh, you scraped your 
forehead. Let's get that taken care of.
[Merrin] 
I feel so pathetic.
[Chloé] 
It was just one silly mistake. Don't beat yourself 
up over it.
[Chloé] 
When I think about you, I think about how hard 
you work, not about how you messed up once.
[Chloé] 
You're still a gallant knight from a fairy tale 
in my eyes.
[Merrin] 
Chloé... Thank you.
[Chloé] 
Besides, I said I'd take care of you, didn't I?
[Merrin] 
Haha, you did. Though, this isn't quite the same 
as an upset stomach.
[Merrin] 
But perhaps messing up isn't so bad. Especially 
if someone like you ends up taking care of me.

[Merrin] 
Ha!
[Chloé] 
You can do it, Merrin!
[Merrin] 
Yes, I can!
[Merrin] 
HA!
[Merrin] 
Hahaha, I did it! I pulled off the finishing 
move perfectly.
[Chloé] 
Beautifully done, Merrin!
[Merrin] 
And I have you to thank for it, Chloé.
[Merrin] 
You've been helping me with my training since 
this morning, and the long hours are paying off.
[Merrin] 
I am grateful.
[Chloé] 
But are you sure you want to train with me? 
Aren't there others who are more qualified?
[Merrin] 
No. I wouldn't have anyone else.
[Chloé] 
How come?
[Merrin] 
Honestly, you're one of the few friends I feel 
I can be...uncool...around.
[Merrin] 
I don't have to worry you'll be disenchanted 
if your fairy-tale knight isn't quite flawless.
[Merrin] 
I am so grateful for that.
[Chloé] 
Hah, so that's it.
[Chloé] 
You know, I'm not the only one who feels 
that way.
[Chloé] 
Who could be disenchanted with you? It doesn't 
matter if you stumble sometimes.
[Chloé] 
Everyone knows how cool you are, and a few 
mistakes won't change that.
[Chloé] 
We know you have the true spirit of a knight 
inside.
[Merrin] 
Chloé, I have to say...
[Merrin] 
I feel so lucky to have met you, and I'd be 
honored if you'd go on fighting by my side.
[Chloé] 
It would be a dream come true, Merrin.
