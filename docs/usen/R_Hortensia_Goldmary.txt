=== Hortensia & Goldmary ===
--- C ---


[Hortensia]
Goldmary! I heard a rumor that some gentleman
callers were asking after you in town.
[Goldmary]
I'm sorry that you didn't hear it from me, but it
happens too often for me to tell you every time.
[Hortensia]
Oh, I'm not mad. So, uh, what did you...do?
What'd you tell them?
[Goldmary]
I declined as politely as I could.
[Hortensia]
That makes sense. I guess you're pretty used to
this kind of thing, huh?
[Hortensia]
I mean, this has been happening to you for a
while, right?
[Goldmary]
Hm, I'm afraid so.
[Goldmary]
I seem to attract that sort of attention
wherever I go.
[Goldmary]
I'm sorry if my natural charisma is in any way
an inconvenience to you...
[Hortensia]
No, that's...not what I mean. That kind of stuff
just doesn't happen to me, is all.
[Goldmary]
It will when you're older.
[Hortensia]
What, like I'm a little kid or something?!
[Goldmary]
Of course not.
[Hortensia]
Well, I guess I should look on the bright side.
You set the standard of charming.
[Hortensia]
I only expect the best from my retainers.
I'm proud to see you excel.
[Goldmary]
Thank you.
[Hortensia]
Speaking of excellence, maybe you can teach
me some of your skills. Cooking, for instance.
[Goldmary]
It would be my pleasure.

[Hortensia]
Wow. I'm a terrible cook.
[Goldmary]
You're doing great. Follow my lead and this will
turn out fine.
[Goldmary]
You can do this.
[Hortensia]
Get ready to flip it. One swift motion... Now!
[Hortensia]
Ah! I did it!
[Goldmary]
You did. It's a little...lopsided, but the flavor
is what's most important.
[Hortensia]
I hope it tastes good, then. Try it for me?
[Goldmary]
Mmm! Delicious. It's wonderful.
[Hortensia]
Yes! Soon I'll be every bit as charming and
talented as you, Goldmary.
[Goldmary]
Of course.
[Hortensia]
Hehe, with a retainer like you, though, I can't
let my guard down.
[Goldmary]
A retainer, you say...
[Hortensia]
Something wrong with that?
[Goldmary]
Nothing at all, except that Rosado and I are not
officially your retainers.
[Hortensia]
Oh, I don't care about what's official or not.
[Hortensia]
When the Fell Dragon awakened and the war
started, we were all just classmates.
[Hortensia]
But Father asked me to return to the castle,
and one thing led to another.
[Goldmary]
It was Rosado and I who insisted on
accompanying you home.
[Hortensia]
Yeah, but I wouldn't have had it any other way.
[Hortensia]
I didn't even want to leave the academy, much
less get separated from my friends.
[Hortensia]
But I guess I did rope you into this mess,
didn't I? I'm sorry.
[Goldmary]
I'm the one who should apologize.
[Goldmary]
Retainers to Elusian royalty are supposed to be
hand-picked by the king.
[Goldmary]
We ran roughshod over that process. And now
we'll never be able to get his approval.
[Goldmary]
All because I failed to protect your father.
[Hortensia]
There was nothing any of us could do.
[Hortensia]
Besides, he'd have given you both his blessing.
No doubt in my mind.
[Hortensia]
So I don't want to hear another word about it,
OK? You have nothing to apologize for.
[Goldmary]
I'm relieved to hear you say that.
[Hortensia]
And I'm relieved you're here with me.
[Hortensia]
I hope you'll stay on, even after the war's over.
Will you accompany me back to the academy?
[Goldmary]
I'd consider it a privilege.

[Goldmary]
Do you remember the first time we met?
[Hortensia]
The very first time?
[Hortensia]
Well, I'd skipped some grades, which got me
into the advanced class...
[Goldmary]
It was well before that.
[Hortensia]
Wait, it was?
[Goldmary]
Yes. Before the advanced class.
[Goldmary]
I'd accidentally wandered into a skirmish
between Brodian and Elusian forces.
[Goldmary]
The whole town quickly became a battlefield,
with me caught in the middle. I was terrified.
[Goldmary]
It was you who got me out of there.
You saved me.
[Hortensia]
Oh! I remember that day!
[Hortensia]
We'd gotten reports of Brodia's surprise attack.
I went to check on the troops.
[Hortensia]
There was a lone girl who'd gotten left behind...
That was you?
[Goldmary]
It was. I was about to be cut down by a Brodian
soldier, but you protected me with magic.
[Goldmary]
You pulled me onto your pegasus, flew me to
safety, and left. Didn't even give me your name.
[Goldmary]
Imagine my surprise when we met for the
second time in the academy's advanced class.
[Hortensia]
Why have you never mentioned this before?
[Goldmary]
I was embarrassed.
[Goldmary]
I bring it up now because...I want you to know
how deeply I respect you.
[Hortensia]
Thank you. That really means a lot.
[Hortensia]
I'm glad you told me. And for what it's worth,
I really respect you too.
[Hortensia]
You put your life on the line to keep me safe.
I couldn't ask for a better friend.
[Hortensia]
It doesn't hurt that you're adorable either!
Just being near you makes me look good.
[Goldmary]
Haha, you're absolutely right.
[Hortensia]
Should I take that to mean you won't be
leaving my side anytime soon?
[Goldmary]
Of course.
[Goldmary]
I'm your retainer, after all, aren't I?
[Goldmary]
More than that, Hortensia...I'm your friend.
I will do anything I can to support you.
