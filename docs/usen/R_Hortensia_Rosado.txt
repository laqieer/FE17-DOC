[Rosado] 
Haha! Picture-perfect, Hortensia!
[Hortensia] 
Huh? What did you say?
[Rosado] 
Look! I drew your picture! I can draw real fast─ 
it's my not-so-hidden talent.
[Rosado] 
See? It's practically a mirror. And look at how 
beautiful you are!
[Hortensia] 
Seriously? I'm staring off into the distance. 
I look boring.
[Hortensia] 
Here, do it again. I'll pose for it properly 
this time.
[Rosado] 
I like this one, though.
[Hortensia] 
Are you joking? It's awful. The expression 
doesn't...express me at all!
[Hortensia] 
Here, this is my good side. Draw me again.
[Rosado] 
Nah. Your first expression's better.
[Hortensia] 
This is an order from your princess.
[Rosado] 
Fine, fine. Make the face again... Done. Is this 
what you wanted?
[Hortensia] 
Perfect! Be sure to throw that other one away.
[Hortensia] 
We can't let future generations think I was some 
boring girl always staring off at nothing.
[Rosado] 
There's nothing boring about you...

[Rosado] 
Yeah, she's just wrong. This expression is 
way better.

[Hortensia] 
Hey! That's the portrait you drew of me 
staring at nothing!
[Hortensia] 
I told you to throw it away. Why is it still here?
[Rosado] 
I'm sorry...but also kinda not?
[Rosado] 
I really like what I see in this picture.
[Hortensia] 
Well I don't. And it's my face. Get rid of it!
[Rosado] 
If you really hate it that much... OK.
[Hortensia] 
Why is this at all difficult?
[Rosado] 
Because it's a picture of the real you. Not the 
fake smile you put on.
[Rosado] 
You used to be so expressive!
[Rosado] 
Like back at the academy! Remember?
[Hortensia] 
I can't, Rosado.
[Hortensia] 
I can't dwell on the academy. I don't get to do 
that anymore.
[Hortensia] 
I'm a princess, and that means I keep smiling, 
all the time, forever.
[Rosado] 
Well, that's a load of royal duty.
[Hortensia] 
Heh. Yeah, but it's what we get. And that's why 
that picture has to get tossed. Understand?
[Rosado] 
Yeah. Farewell then, honest Hortensia...

[Rosado] 
This is too many Corrupted to take on! 
Hortensia, we have to retreat!
[Hortensia] 
No, I've got this! I can...handle it!
[Rosado] 
Look out!
[Hortensia] 
Rosado, no!
[Rosado] 
Ah!
[Hortensia] 
Rosado... I was trying to protect you.
[Hortensia] 
Let's get out of here─no one's dying today!

[Hortensia] 
Rosado! Come back to me! Don't be dead...
[Rosado] 
Ugh...
[Hortensia] 
You're awake! Are you all right? Do you 
recognize me?!
[Rosado] 
Yeah... Sure, sure. Just nodded off for a sec.
[Hortensia] 
Nodded off?! I thought you were dead!
[Hortensia] 
Wait, what's the paper fo─ Are you DRAWING?!
[Rosado] 
Hahaha! Picture-perfect, Hortensia!
[Hortensia] 
WHAT?
[Hortensia] 
You're not even hurt!
[Rosado] 
Nope! But take a look─you really are beautiful 
this time.
[Hortensia] 
It's right when you woke up. I look so...relieved.
[Hortensia] 
That is a pretty good one.
[Hortensia] 
You're right... I used to make faces like this 
more when we were in school.
[Rosado] 
Usually when the history teacher called on 
someone else instead of you!
[Hortensia] 
Hey!
[Rosado] 
So, can I keep this one?
[Hortensia] 
Fine. But you can't show it to anyone.
[Rosado] 
Of course I won't.
[Hortensia] 
...
[Hortensia] 
Thanks for looking out for me.
[Hortensia] 
I feel like you're always saving me from 
something.
[Rosado] 
If you wanna pay me back, just show me the 
real you once in a while. That's all I want.
[Hortensia] 
Hehe, deal.
[Hortensia] 
You're much more than just a retainer to me, 
you know. You're my friend.
[Hortensia] 
And as long as we're friends, I don't think I'll 
have any trouble being myself.
