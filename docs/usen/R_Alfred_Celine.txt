[Alfred] 
Hup! Eh... Hup! Eh... Hup! Eh...
[Céline] 
Good morning, Alfred.
[Alfred] 
Morning, Céline!
[Céline] 
Training hard again, I see. Though, normally I 
don't find you using a shovel.
[Céline] 
That's a deep hole you've dug too. Won't this 
be hazardous for the others?
[Alfred] 
Heh heh! Oh, Céline, this isn't training.
[Alfred] 
And if anything, I need to dig deeper!
[Alfred] 
Hup! Eh...
[Céline] 
What in the world is the purpose of this?
[Alfred] 
I overheard the kitchen staff this morning 
complaining that there wasn't enough water.
[Alfred] 
So I'm digging a well for them.
[Céline] 
Pardon?!
[Céline] 
Alfred. If the water supply is low, there's a river 
nearby we can fetch more from.
[Céline] 
What possessed you to decide that the solution 
to the problem was to dig a well?!
[Alfred] 
Hey, you're right. That's using your noggin!
[Alfred] 
I'd better find a jug and leg it to the river. 
Thanks for the tip, Céline!
[Céline] 
You haven't changed one bit, it seems.
[Céline] 
Better that you should dress in pelts and furs to 
warn people of your barbaric mindset!

[Céline] 
Do you know what you are, Alfred? 
A barbarian in prince's clothing.
[Alfred] 
Huh! What a nice thing to say. Thanks, Céline!
[Céline] 
How did that strike you as a compliment?!
[Alfred] 
You meant that I've got muscles all over like 
a barbarian, right?
[Alfred] 
That's real praise, even if you're just saying it 
'cause I'm your brother.
[Céline] 
That is not at all how I meant it!
[Alfred] 
Hey, hey... It's OK, Céline.
[Alfred] 
If that wasn't the idea, then what did you 
mean by it?
[Céline] 
Your first impulse on hearing we were low on 
water was to dig a well!
[Alfred] 
Oh, right! Some mix-up, huh? Boy, was my 
face red!
[Céline] 
Would that it were the only example.
[Céline] 
What about the time you heard some soldiers 
wishing they could cleanse themselves?
[Céline] 
You immediately leapt to dig them a hot spring!
[Alfred] 
Oh. Do we not like hot springs?
[Céline] 
That isn't my point. Why is your first instinct 
always to go digging?!
[Alfred] 
'Cause it's good training!
[Céline] 
Save your breath!
[Céline] 
It's instincts like that that mark you as barbaric.
[Céline] 
Which would be fine for most men, but you are 
a prince. Try to act the part.
[Alfred] 
All right, Céline. I get your point.
[Alfred] 
From now on, I'm gonna train even harder. 
No more skip days!
[Alfred] 
Pretty soon, I'll be so beefy that everyone can 
tell right off what a barbarian I am.
[Alfred] 
No...more...confusion!
[Céline] 
Ugh! Once again, you have completely missed 
the point.

[Alfred] 
Ugh...
[Céline] 
What are you doing there, Alfred? Digging 
another well? Or is this more training?
[Alfred] 
Something like that. Trying to keep up my 
health, you know.
[Alfred] 
Yeah. If I train hard enough, then... 
I won't suffer like I used to...
[Céline] 
...Alfred?
[Alfred] 
Ugh...
[Céline] 
What's wrong?!
[Alfred] 
Don't worry, Céline... It's...just an attack. 
It'll pass soon...
[Céline] 
An attack?! Is it your old illness?
[Alfred] 
I was doing so well... That part of my life was 
supposed to be long gone...
[Céline] 
Wait here. I'll fetch someone at once.
[Alfred] 
No. Stop!
[Céline] 
What? Why should I?!
[Alfred] 
I don't want anyone to see me like this. Not our 
allies, the Emblems, or the Divine Dragon!
[Alfred] 
I can't let them see this...a weak prince, unfit to 
fight, who could collapse any day...
[Céline] 
None of them would see you that way. They're 
far too gracious for that.
[Alfred] 
But I would still know! And besides, I don't 
want them to worry about me.
[Alfred] 
As far as they're concerned, I want to be the 
spirited prince who loves working out.
[Alfred] 
Just let me rest for a while. I'll be fine. 
Please, Céline.
[Céline] 
Very well. But know that if your condition ever 
worsens, I will seek help.
[Alfred] 
Thanks.
[Alfred] 
Having a sister like you is true happiness, 
if you ask me.
[Céline] 
That's your idea of true happiness? Don't 
be absurd.
[Alfred] 
Well, what about you, then? What brings you 
true happiness?
[Céline] 
Nothing.
[Alfred] 
Really? You've got good friends, you got your 
health─none of that does it?
[Céline] 
I take joy in those things, to be sure. But I don't 
value happiness as a life goal.
[Céline] 
After all, what if I found it?
[Céline] 
Then my whole life afterward would be spent 
looking fondly back.
[Alfred] 
Haha, really? Even if something better 
comes along?
[Céline] 
The possibility that it never will is terrifying. 
I couldn't bear it.
[Céline] 
I've always yearned for happiness and saw only 
misery. Like the day I fled from the castle.
[Céline] 
If Firene had fallen or Mother died or you were 
lost to us...I wondered, "How would I respond?"
[Céline] 
And now this? If things get worse, and you 
have to leave... What will I... How can I...
[Céline] 
...
[Alfred] 
Hey... I'm not gonna die, OK? I'll be fine if I 
stick with my training.
[Céline] 
You really do have the mind of a barbarian. 
If only you had the body to match.
[Alfred] 
Haha, I'll get there! That's why I work out.
[Alfred] 
Oh, Céline, look! You see that four-leaf clover?
[Céline] 
Hmm? Where?
[Alfred] 
Right by your foot. There you go. A small joy.
[Céline] 
A small joy... That takes me back. We often 
sought such things when we were younger.
[Céline] 
At that age, I was better at it than you. 
I wonder when you surpassed me.
[Alfred] 
Talking to you makes me feel better. 
Chalk up another small joy for me.
[Céline] 
I'm not certain that counts, but I'm relieved to 
hear that the worst has passed.
[Alfred] 
Let me make it up to you, Céline. I'll find lots 
of little joys and bring them to you.
[Alfred] 
I can't promise everything will be fine with me, 
but we can prop each other up...for Firene.
[Céline] 
Yes, Alfred. I will support you in anything.
[Céline] 
Whatever else happens, we can make sure 
we return to Firene. Together.
