[Alear] 
What is this place, Lucina? I feel a magical 
power here.
[Lucina] 
This appears very similar to Arena Ferox. 
Most curious.
[Alear] 
Ferox? That's a place from your world, right?
[Lucina] 
Yes. Ferox is a kingdom divided by east and 
west, with a militaristic khan overseeing each.
[Lucina] 
Every so many years, a fighting tournament is 
held to determine which khan will rule them all.
[Lucina] 
Arena Ferox is where I crossed swords with 
my father.
[Alear] 
He taught you swordsmanship, yes? It must 
have been an interesting, if fierce, bout.
[Lucina] 
Yes. It was a hard fight. He had no idea who 
I was and held nothing back.
[Lucina] 
He'd trained me well, but that fight was when I 
first saw just how strong my father really was.
[Lucina] 
That must be precisely why this familiar place 
was chosen as a trial ground.
[Alear] 
Trial ground? What does that mean?
[Lucina] 
We each feel the extraordinary power here. 
Tell me what it feels like, deep down.
[Alear] 
It's almost like I'm sensing your power...but also 
like you're far away.
[Lucina] 
Well then, draw your weapon. Fight me. If you 
pass the trial, our bond will grow stronger.
[Lucina] 
With a stronger bond, you will be able to draw 
upon more of my power as an Emblem.
[Alear] 
I hope I can learn as much in this arena as 
you did.
[Lucina] 
That's good to hear. However...
[Lucina] 
It's going to require more than hope for you to 
win this battle.
[Alear] 
You're going to be surprised if you think I'm 
only bringing hope to this fight.
[Lucina] 
That's the spirit, !

[Lucina] 
I lost... Your combat skills have grown 
admirably, .
[Lucina] 
Compared to when we first met, you've grown 
strong and become a formidable opponent.
[Alear] 
Thank you. It is in no small part because of your 
guidance, Lucina.
[Lucina] 
Such kind words. If I helped you at all, then 
I couldn't be happier.
[Lucina] 
There's a lesson there, you know. What one 
person can achieve on their own is limited.
[Alear] 
I agree. I couldn't have come this far by myself.
[Alear] 
Everything I've accomplished has been thanks 
to those who have fought beside me.
[Lucina] 
I'm relieved to hear that. I feel my friends close 
by, even now. Their spirits live on in me.
[Alear] 
Their spirits live on...
[Lucina] 
The power of my bonds with them helped us to 
change a hopeless future.
[Lucina] 
The same as you are now, with your own allies.
[Alear] 
You're one of those allies, Lucina. Aren't you?
[Lucina] 
Of course! I'll fight with you until the very last.
[Alear] 
Then we can't lose. No matter what the world 
sends our way.
[Lucina] 
You're right! Our bonds are far stronger 
than destiny!

[Lucina] 
What's wrong, ? You won't win 
just by standing there.

Angry 

[Alear] 
Your stance has no openings. I don't see how 
I could hit you, no matter where I strike.
[Lucina] 
Doubt will only dull your attacks. Trust in 
yourself, and come at me with everything!
[Alear] Strike 

[Alear] 
Understood! Here I come!

[Alfred] 
Relax 
[Alfred] 
Wow, the khans fought in the arena for the right 
to rule? It's almost like fate brought us here.
[Lucina] b 
[Lucina] 
The khans didn't battle. They picked champions 
to fight on their behalf.
[Alfred] Status 
[Alfred] 
Phew! If that is the case, I think it fortunate that 
this place is not the true arena.
[Lucina] 
[Lucina] Status 
Haha, indeed. Now, come at me!
