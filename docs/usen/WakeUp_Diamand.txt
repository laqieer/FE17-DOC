Pardon the intrusion, Divine One.


Sound asleep.
Watching you sleep...
is making me sleepy...
No! I mustn't doze off before the holy altar.


Morning.
I almost nodded off myself...
Close call.


You're awake?
My apologies. I intruded for nothing.


--- C2 ---

It's Diamant. I've come to wake you.


How should I do this?
My voice booms...
so even a gentle whisper might startle you.
Hmm... Hmm...


Oh!
Sorry, I didn't know how to wake you...
so I waited for you to wake yourself. 
Good morning!


Did you sense me...
and wake up?
Impressive.


--- B1 ---

Divine One, I have to speak to you about...
Ah, asleep.


Hmm. The first time I saw you here...
I was just a child.
You still look exactly the same...
serene in your slumber.


You woke!
Even right out of bed, you look as good as ever.
Flattery? No.
I really mean it.


No, no─you should rest.
I'll let everyone know they should handle their 
own affairs today.


--- B2 ---

I've come to greet you, Divine One. Am I early?


Strange.
I feel like I can talk about anything with you.
My medal, my father...
Things no one else knows.


Good morning, and thank you. I was thinking 
about our chat.
I'm glad I can be myself around you.


Ah. As I thought.
No rush then. Take your time.


--- A1 ---

Divine One? I want to check on our supplies 
before─ Oh. Fast asleep.


It is peaceful up here.
Just open sky and clouds.
I can see how easily one might... 
fall asleep... Aah...


Ah, Divine One! You're awake!
Looks like I nodded off.
Thanks for waking me.


Hey! Were you just pretending to sleep?
Hah. You really got me.


--- A2 ---

Coming in.
Hm. Your sleep seems a bit restless today.


You said vulnerability isn't always bad.
It felt so reassuring then, but now...I worry.
Wake up, Divine One.


How are you feeling?
Anything wrong? You can tell me.
It's just the two of us. We can talk...right?


Oh good, you woke.
Looked like a bad dream. I was worried.


--- S1 ---

It's me. I've come to greet you, Divine One.


Fast asleep.
I'm honored that you trust me, but...
I fear what the others may think of our 
vulnerabilities.
I also fear that, one morning, you may 
not wake at all.
Unfounded fears like that...
reveal how close I've grown to you, and how 
I've grown to need you.


Phew. I'm glad you're awake.
I almost let you sleep in, you know.
If you had...I could've taken you in for a few 
moments more.


Hey.
Looks like we can talk now.
This time we share, just you and I...
I truly treasure these moments.


--- S2 ---

Still asleep?
You do seem to enjoy your rest.


Oh, look at that. The ring I gave you...
You wear it even while sleeping.
I sleep with the Pact Ring on. If I could...
I'd even wear it during battle.
It makes me think of peace.
Heh. Do you hear how you've softened this 
prince of a kingdom of warriors?


Hello.
There's no rush, so please...
Until you have to leave...
would you...keep my ring on?


You got up!
I'm impressed, but...
Whether you wake up early or sleep in all day...
I'll always be happy just to see you.
