[Alear] 
Jade! Are you OK?!
[Jade] 
Oh. Divine One.
[Alear] 
I heard you were attacked by bandits! I rushed 
here to check on you.
[Jade] 
Thank you, but I'm fine. I drove them all away.
[Alear] 
Why did they attack you like that?
[Jade] 
I've run into that group before.
[Jade] 
I used to be the guard for the mine near my 
hometown. I stopped them from looting it once.
[Jade] 
They must have tracked me down for revenge.
[Alear] 
Now? After all this time?
[Jade] 
I was pretty infamous among the bandits in our 
area. They used to call me the "Iron Wall."
[Jade] 
Looks like I'm the target of a few deep, long- 
standing grudges.
[Jade] 
But it's fine. I can handle anything they throw 
at me. They're not much of a threat.
[Alear] 
I know you're strong, Jade, but I'm still worried.
[Alear] 
If you ever need backup, you can always count 
on me. I'll do whatever I can.
[Jade] 
Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you like that, 
Divine One...but thank you.

[Alear] 
Hello, Jade. Nice weather today.
[Jade] 
Yes, Divine One. It is.
[Alear] 
Did you see that sunset yesterday? Gorgeous.
[Jade] 
Yes, it was.
[Alear] 
...
[Jade] 
...
[Jade] 
Divine One... We've been running into each 
other a lot lately, haven't we?
[Alear] 
I suppose we have. I'm not bothering you, am I?
[Jade] 
I think I know what's going on.
[Jade] 
You want to be nearby in case those bandits 
try to attack me again. Is that right?
[Alear] 
Ah. I guess I didn't hide it very well.
[Jade] 
I appreciate your concern, but I can handle 
them myself.
[Jade] 
You don't have to watch over me. I'm sure you 
have better things to do.
[Alear] 
Well...I do have some free time that I could be 
enjoying right now.
[Alear] 
You wouldn't mind if I just relaxed around here 
for a while, would you?
[Jade] 
...
[Alear] 
I know how strong you are, Jade.
[Alear] 
I'm not doing this because I think you can't 
handle it. I'm here because I want to help.
[Jade] 
As you wish, Divine One.

[Jade] 
...
[Alear] 
Jade! Are you OK?
[Jade] 
Yes, Divine One. I just made it back.
[Alear] 
Thank goodness. You don't look hurt...but I 
can't believe you did something so reckless.
[Alear] 
Sneaking out to ambush those bandits at their 
hideout all by yourself... Unbelievable!
[Jade] 
I knew the risk I was taking. I had to settle 
things once and for all.
[Jade] 
If I didn't, their revenge plots might have 
dragged on forever.
[Alear] 
...
[Jade] 
Everything is fine now. The bandits have been 
defeated and placed in military custody.
[Jade] 
I made sure to leave a lasting impression...and 
plenty of bruises. They won't be back.
[Jade] 
Thank you for being so concerned. You won't 
have to worry about my safety anymore.
[Alear] 
Amazing. You took care of it all on your own, 
just like you said you would.
[Alear] 
I admit...I'm a bit disappointed. I really hoped 
that I would be able to help you with this.
[Jade] 
Oh, I would never drag you into my unresolved 
business like that, Divine One.
[Alear] 
Why not? We're friends, Jade.
[Jade] 
Friends...
[Jade] 
Hm.
[Alear] 
What's wrong?
[Jade] 
I'm just happy.
[Jade] 
I know I can be hard to read sometimes. I'm not 
very good at expressing my emotions.
[Jade] 
But I am sorry for making you worry. Thank you 
for caring about me, Divine One.
[Alear] 
You're very welcome, Jade.

[Alear] 
Say, Jade... Your father studies gems, and your 
mother is a jeweler. Is that right?
[Jade] 
That's right, Divine One.
[Jade] 
I used to live in a mining town. Everyone there 
had jobs related to minerals and gems.
[Jade] 
I would try to help my mother with her jewelry 
from time to time, but I was all thumbs.
[Jade] 
So, in the end, I settled on being a guard for our 
town's mine.
[Alear] 
You've probably been dealing with gems and 
jewelry since you were a child.
[Jade] 
Sure. I guess I'm more knowledgeable 
than most.
[Alear] 
In that case, I'd like you to tell me what you 
make of this...
[Jade] 
The Pact Ring?
[Jade] 
Hmm.
[Jade] 
There's a mysterious power inside. No other 
ring has ever felt like this...
[Alear] 
That's just how it felt for me.
[Alear] 
Well, that ring and its power are both yours 
now, Jade.
[Jade] 
Huh? Wh-what do you mean?
[Alear] 
I mean they're yoursâ”€if you'll have them. 
Let them be a symbol of our growing bond.
[Alear] 
I want to stay by your side, Jade. Then you'll 
never have to fight alone again.
[Alear] 
So...will you take the ring? Please?
[Jade] 
...
[Alear] 
You really aren't kidding about being hard to 
read, are you?
[Alear] 
But I think I understand. I know what you're 
feeling right now.
[Jade] 
Yes. I know you do.
[Jade] 
I'm happy. I'm very, very happy.
[Jade] 
It really is the Pact Ring... Thank you. So much.
[Alear] 
Will you continue to walk the road ahead 
by my side?
[Jade] 
Of course, Divine Dragon .
[Jade] 
The bond we share is now stronger than iron... 
and nothing will break it.
