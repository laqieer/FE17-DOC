I heard you have some trouble waking up! 
I'm here to help.


Haha, I guess I heard right. You're obviously a 
deep sleeper.
Now, what to do... Well, let's not overthink it.
WAKE UP, DIVINE ONE!


Morning!
Was I too harsh?
I'm glad it worked, at least.
And a hearty shout from the diaphragm is good 
training, so you helped me out too!


Looks like I heard wrong. You're already up.
Oh well! In that case...
Good morning, Divine One! I hope you have a 
great day.


--- C2 ---

I was asked to come in and wake you. Hope you 
don't mind!


Now, how do I make your morning extra nice?
Oh! I've got candy!
Maybe I just...feed you one of these? Would that 
be nice?


Hey, good morning! You probably heard me 
talking to myself.
Don't worry, I wasn't actually gonna feed you 
candy in your sleep.
Probably.


You did it! Great job.
Next we can work on getting you up early 
enough to train with me.


--- B1 ---

Here to brighten your morning, Divine One!


Don't worry. I've got nothing extra planned.
You asked me not to go out of my way, so I'm 
not going to.
I don't want to cause you any trouble.


Did I do a good job?
I'm glad. But if you do want a big breakfast...
or a soothing lullaby at night...
just let me know, OK?


Let's be grateful for every day we get to spend 
with our friends.
Danger's all around us. We can't take anything 
for granted.


--- B2 ---

I like coming here.
It brings back lots of memories.


My mother took me to your altar...
all the time when I was a kid.
Now look at us...
casually having a friendly chat. Isn't that odd?


You're up!
Haha, it's still weird for me to see that.
You never woke up before, no matter how many 
visitors you had.
I'm glad that's changed.


You're awake? But I didn't even do anything!
Hahaha! I guess I can't complain having such an 
easy job.
Anyway, good morning.


--- A1 ---

I'm here to make sure you wake up. That means 
no going back to sleep!


I'm really glad we got to bond over a run. I had 
a great time!
You complained a lot, but you kept up very well.
It made me happy.


Hey! It's me, your first friend!
Glad to see you're awake.
Along with being the first...
I hope I'm also one of the best.


Good, you're up. You weren't thinking about 
dozing back off, were you?
Haha, that's too bad. Sorry.
As your first friend, I just can't allow it.


--- A2 ---

It's morning! Wanna go for a run?


If you're not awake yet...
I'll train while I wait.
Hya! Hya! Hya! Aah...
Right. Now to work these arms...


Oh, good morning.
If you're too tired to get up, I could always 
carry you.
It'd help my workout, so you'd actually be 
doing me a favor.


You're up! Great.
That's what I like to see.
OK, let's get going! We'll start with five laps 
around the Somniel!


--- S1 ---

Sound asleep, huh?
We'll see about that.


Hmm, how do I handle this?
How's that story go?
Something like...
A deep sleep, a true love's kiss...
Nah, that's not me.
I'm not going to copy some storybook. I'll do 
this my own way.
Hey there. Wake up, wake up...
Hate to disturb your peaceful sleep, but how 
about you open those eyes?


Oh, good. If that didn't work, I was going to 
lift weights by your bed.
Haha, kidding, kidding. I wouldn't be so tough 
on you.
I love you too much for that.


You jump right out of bed these days, huh?
My morning routine's rubbing off on you.
That's what you get for being my partner.


--- S2 ---

I was so excited to see you...
that I rushed through my training.


My embroidery.
The gift I gave you...
You put it on display.
When this war is over, I'll add a new pattern 
to it.
One that represents the close bond we share.
That way, even when I'm long gone...
you'll have proof that I was always thinking 
of you.


You're up! Great. Let's get to training.
What is it? Not ready to go just yet?
You want to spend some quiet time 
together first?
I'm so happy to hear you say that. I'd love to.


Morning! How are you?
Glad to see me, I hope?
Knowing you're happy to be with me...
is what makes me the happiest of all.
