So sorry to bother you, Divine One. 
May I come in?


I enjoy taking care of people...
but I didn't have many chances at my 
family manor.
That's why I've been looking forward to 
today, heh.


Rise and shine!
I'll handle your morning arrangements.
I've always admired the work of servants.
In this moment, I'm at your service.


Oh! Good morning!
I'll go alert today's chef...
and have them get your breakfast started.


--- C2 ---

I'm running late! How awful of me.


I was trying to plan your breakfast...
and lost track of time.
Bread with vegetables? With a roast as the main 
course? Or perhaps...


Sorry to bother you first thing...
but could you tell me what sort of breakfast 
you prefer?
I'll make sure the kitchen prepares it in 
advance next time.


I must apologize, Divine One.
I was trying to select a breakfast for you...
and I ran late.
What sort of menu would you like today?


--- B1 ---

I'm honored to have been entrusted with such 
an important task...


I've brought a gift of jewels to coax you out 
of bed!
Diamond, topaz, emerald...
There's even a ruby and a sapphire to match 
your eyes.


Morning! Aren't these gemstones beautiful?
They're from Brodia.
I even had them refined!
I hope they brighten your day, Divine One.


You wake so elegantly, Divine One, as befits 
your station.
I find it hard to get out of bed.
I troubled my family's servants to no end.

So many stray objects up here...


A milk bottle today, tea leaves yesterday...
And some metal the day prior.
I leave most items alone...
I won't bring all of them to you like I did with 
that roadside pebble.


Good morning.
I might track down the owners of some stray 
items today...
Would you be willing to accompany me, 
Divine One?


Good morning, Divine One.
I found a full bottle of milk outside!
After that pebble...
things left on the ground have been catching 
my eye...


--- A1 ---

Oh! There's dirt on my clothes...
I should have stopped...
for a change of dress.


Still, I can't neglect my training.
I have to work hard to make up for my lack 
of ability.
We're all capable of growth...
but focused effort is the only way to attain it.


I see you're awake!
Some rise slowly...
Others spring right up!
Which do you prefer, Divine One?


Morning! I squeezed in a bit of training before 
coming here...
I apologize if I seem unkempt.
I do hope you'll forgive me.

I brought a bouquet of herbs, Divine One! 
I picked them this morning.


You seemed to enjoy the bouquet I brought the 
other day...
so I thought I'd bring you another!
They'll last longer when dried...
so you can enjoy them for a long time.


Oh! I thought I might leave them by your pillow.
But I'm glad you're awake.
I might have missed this chance to see your 
face light up.


Aah.
These herbs are said to rouse one from sleep 
with a refreshed feeling.
So? Have they worked their magic on you?


--- S1 ---

I've come to wake you, Divine One.


I picked some wild flowers for you.
You like gifts like these...
isn't that right?
You know, I think I might do anything...
to see friends smile.
Your smile is particularly infectious...
so you might need to make room for even more 
gifts from me.


Rise and shine, hehe!
Mornings with you...
are my favorite kind.
I hope you agree, Divine One.
That would make me happy.


Morning!
Showing me gems first thing?
A rare gift...
I'm talking about your eyes, of course.
They're so dazzling in the morning. They shine 
like the sun!


--- S2 ---

Ah, my bouquetâ”€and the pebble!
Hah, it's nice to see a bit of my influence 
in this room.


Ah, fast asleep.
I should buy you a beach somewhere so you 
can get more rest.
No, no. That won't do. You prefer gifts from 
the heart.
I didn't bring anything like that.
I have nothing to offer...
Oh, wait. Of course. I know the perfect gift.
I'll give you my undivided attention. I won't 
leave your side until you wake up.


Ah! You woke up!
I was just, uh...
Well, I was trying to give you a gift.
It didn't last very long, but it's the thought 
that counts.
Isn't that right?


Good morning. I'm so glad...
that you accepted all of my gifts.
I'm also caring for the ring you gave me.
It's undoubtedly my most prized possession.
