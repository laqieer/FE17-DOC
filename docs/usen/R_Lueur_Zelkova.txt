[Alear] 
What's that you're doing, Zelkov?
[Zelkov] 
Hello, Divine One. I am melting wax, with 
which I will *produce* candles.
[Alear] 
Oh, wow! Is candle-making a hobby of yours?
[Zelkov] 
You could call it that. I *prefer* to think of it as 
a pursuit through which to kill time.
[Alear] 
Kill time?
[Zelkov] 
Some say you kill time until time kills you. 
That is my *philosophy.*
[Alear] 
I had no idea you were such a profound 
thinker, Zelkov.
[Zelkov] 
Heh. Not at all.
[Zelkov] 
I may speak in a way that *suggests* a deeper 
meaning, but rarely is that actually the case.
[Zelkov] 
It is simply another way of "killing time." 
Idle *amusement,* nothing more.
[Alear] 
Wow...
[Zelkov] 
What is it? Your eyes are possessed of a most 
*curious* twinkle.
[Alear] 
I guess I just find your outlook fascinating. It's a 
whole new perspective to me.
[Alear] 
Somehow it feels like you know a lot of things 
that I don't.
[Zelkov] 
Heh. You are *interesting.* Perhaps, next time 
we chat, I will show you an interesting place.
[Alear] 
Now I'm curious.
[Zelkov] 
I will keep the nature of it a *surprise* for 
the time being.
[Alear] 
All right. I look forward to it!

[Zelkov] 
Welcome. This is the *interesting* place that I 
mentioned to you before. My secret sanctum.
[Alear] 
Whoa! I've never seen so many shelves full 
of...stuff!
[Zelkov] 
Yes. I *collect* odds and ends for my pursuits 
here in this place.
[Zelkov] 
Instructions for a *culinary* technique of my 
own devising. A map for a hike only I know.
[Zelkov] 
There is a manual of training techniques I wrote, 
next to a rock that I polished to a *sparkle.*
[Zelkov] 
And here are some balls of *lint* I've gathered 
for reasons even I don't quite understand.
[Zelkov] 
That should suffice for a summary. A detailed 
accounting would take *hours.*
[Zelkov] 
Just know *every* object here has helped me 
kill time. Feel free to handle whatever you like.
[Alear] 
Thank you! What a treasure trove...
[Zelkov] 
Once my work is done each day, I fill my 
evenings with these varied *pursuits.*
[Zelkov] 
As I *enjoy* them, I am always mindful to leave 
something unfinished for the next day.
[Zelkov] 
That ensures I always have a project. 
A reason to *continue* living.
[Alear] 
Wow... So philosophical...
[Zelkov] 
You... You truly think so?
[Zelkov] 
Well... Thank you for enduring this frivolity. 
I hope I did not *bore* you.
[Alear] 
What a thing to say! I'm not even done 
exploring in here yet!
[Zelkov] 
Heh-heh. You honor me. Take as much *time* 
as you like.

[Zelkov] 
Today's work is complete. Now I am free to 
*kill time* until sleep arrives.
[Alear] 
Ah, Zelkov! I've been *waiting* for you!
[Zelkov] 
Divine One?
[Alear] 
I finished my tasks *early* today, so I came 
*here.* I hope you *don't mind!*
[Zelkov] 
I don't mind, but...the way you are speaking... 
Do you mean to suggest...a *deeper meaning*?
[Alear] 
Perhaps I do. Perhaps some of your *influence* 
has rubbed off on me, Zelkov.
[Zelkov] 
You should not want to walk the path I walk. 
People will *look* at you strangely.
[Alear] 
Let them. I don't *care* what they think.
[Alear] 
I'm just *amusing myself* and *killing time* by 
*speaking in a profound way.*
[Zelkov] 
Oh, no no no! Please, Divine One, do not allow 
yourself to be *influenced* by someone like me.
[Alear] 
Why *not*?
[Zelkov] 
We lead very different lives, Divine One. 
You have an important *purpose* to fulfill.
[Zelkov] 
I am a terrible influence. Please, you must 
follow a path more *fitting* to your station.
[Alear] 
I don't think I *will.* Not in this room, anyway.
[Zelkov] 
What do you mean?
[Alear] 
It's true that there are *differences* between 
you and me, *Zelkov.*
[Alear] 
But here, in *this* room, what do those 
*differences* *matter*?
[Alear] 
All we're doing is *killing time.*
[Zelkov] 
I deeply regret filling your head with *rubbish.*
[Alear] 
Please, don't apologize. *Go on,* tell me more 
about your *collection*.
[Zelkov] 
Very well, what should I talk about next? 
Ah, this here is *perfect.*
[Zelkov] 
A list of the most mysterious words to 
*emphasize* to *suggest* a deeper meaning.
[Alear] 
Ooo! That sounds *interesting!*

[Zelkov] 
I have been *waiting* for you, Divine One. 
Please, take a seat.
[Alear] 
What do you have for me today, Zelkov?
[Zelkov] 
I thought I might tell you a *story.*
[Alear] 
About what?
[Zelkov] 
How I came to be as I am. Why I require these 
*pursuits* in order to have a reason to live.
[Zelkov] 
I am afraid it is a rather *dark* tale. But it is 
the only way for you to understand.
[Zelkov] 
When I was young, my family was attacked 
and *murdered* by bandits.
[Alear] 
That's horrible.
[Zelkov] 
I swore *revenge.* It was my first pursuitâ”€and it 
led me to take up the life of an assassin.
[Zelkov] 
A decade ago, my *efforts* bore their last fruit. 
All my family's killers were vanquished.
[Zelkov] 
Once I had achieved my end, I suddenly became 
aware that I had *nothing* left. No purpose.
[Zelkov] 
It was King Hyacinth who rescued me, quite by 
chance. I was *selected* to join the royal guard.
[Zelkov] 
Then I was *promoted* to retainer, and that 
*purpose* has sustained me in large part since.
[Zelkov] 
Thus I *stand* before you today.
[Alear] 
I appreciate you telling me this, but I'm still 
not sure I understand why you felt the need.
[Zelkov] 
I would like you to join me in my continued 
pursuit of purpose, Divine One.
[Alear] 
You what?
[Zelkov] 
Forgive my foolishness. I should have *known* 
you would never want such a thing.
[Alear] 
The complete opposite, as a matter of fact. 
There's nothing I want more.
[Alear] 
I've actually been planning to give this to you 
for a while. Now seems like the right time.
[Zelkov] 
The *Pact* Ring...
[Alear] 
Whether it's to find a greater purpose or just 
to kill time, I want to be there to support you.
[Zelkov] 
You are actually *serious,* aren't you?
[Alear] 
Of course I am. Would I joke about something 
so important?
[Zelkov] 
You would not. Therefore I accept, and gladly.
[Zelkov] 
In return, , please accept a gift 
from me.
[Alear] 
A necklace? It's lovely.
[Zelkov] 
Each component was selected to represent a 
facet of my respect and affection for you.
[Alear] 
This is amazing, Zelkov. Thank you.
[Alear] 
You know, I just noticed...
[Zelkov] 
What is it?
[Alear] 
The way you're speaking has changed 
somehow. I can't put my finger on it.
[Zelkov] 
Heh-heh. You're right. I've felt no need to 
sound as if my words have a deeper meaning.
[Zelkov] 
I suppose that's because this conversation is 
already meaningful to me.
[Alear] 
Haha, I'm flattered.
[Alear] 
Now, if you don't mind, I'd love to hear about 
how you chose the materials for this necklace.
[Zelkov] 
Of course. I will tell you the whole process, 
from start to finish.
[Zelkov] 
And I will share how each choice along the way 
was governed by my sentiments.
