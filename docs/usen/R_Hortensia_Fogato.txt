=== Hortensia & Fogado ===
--- C ---




[Fogado]
Princess Hortensia! You're not busy, are you?
Let's grab a cup of tea.
[Hortensia]
Prince Fogado.
[Hortensia]
I know I'm irresistible, but I'm also a princess.
You shouldn't be hitting on me.
[Fogado]
I'm not up to anything, I promise. Was hoping
to have a nice, chaste exchange of ideas.
[Hortensia]
Hmm.
[Hortensia]
Act innocent if you want, but even in Elusia,
we've heard what a flirt you are.
[Fogado]
People talk about me all the way in Elusia?
I'm flattered.
[Hortensia]
You wouldn't be if you heard what they said.
[Fogado]
Why put stock in gossip? I want to have tea and
learn of each other's countries. That's all.
[Hortensia]
No thanks. Besides, my sister needs help today.
[Hortensia]
Hey, you're a prince! Shouldn't you have a
ton of work too?
[Fogado]
Solm is a queendom, so my sister is first in line
to the throne, not me.
[Hortensia]
So you just waste the day away, wandering
around and flirting?
[Fogado]
Not flirting. Patrolling.
[Hortensia]
Oh, OK then. You definitely got me there.
[Hortensia]
Hey! Why aren't you helping Princess Timerra?!
Lighten her workload!
[Fogado]
Heh, ouch! That's harsh.
[Fogado]
Oh well. If you happen to change your mind and
decide you'd like tea─just tea─I'm around.

[Fogado]
Hey, Miss! Are you out here by yourself?
[Hortensia]
There's Prince Fogado...talking to some lady.
[Hortensia]
Hitting on her, too, by the look of it.
[Hortensia]
Some prince. I'm gonna put a stop to this!

[Hortensia]
You were helping her carry stuff? That's it?!
[Fogado]
Yeah, of course. Why did you get so angry?
[Hortensia]
I'm sorry. I didn't think you were actually
helping people out here...
[Fogado]
I told you that I patrol around town. That's what
I do on patrol─help people.
[Hortensia]
I guess I'm sorry for doubting you.
[Fogado]
Nah, that's all right. I'm used to it.
[Hortensia]
...
[Hortensia]
If that's the case, I suppose I'll join you.
[Fogado]
Really? Great! What time will you join me for
tea, then?
[Hortensia]
Join you in helping people, doofus.
[Fogado]
Haha! Oh, that's what you meant.
[Fogado]
All right, then. I look forward to it.

[Hortensia]
Wow.
[Hortensia]
I gotta admit, you're actually kind of amazing.
[Fogado]
Oh, you're in love with me? Well, I'll have to
let your young heart down gently, then...
[Hortensia]
Gross. No. Not what I meant.
[Fogado]
Haha, sorry, sorry. It's involuntary. What were
you saying?
[Hortensia]
You really listen to your people's problems.
Princess Timerra is lucky to have you.
[Hortensia]
I help my sister, too, but only with the stuff that
happens inside the palace.
[Hortensia]
Going around town with you has shown me
what the rest of the world is like.
[Hortensia]
It makes me wonder if I've actually been helping
Ivy...or if I've been kidding myself.
[Fogado]
Oh, I know that feeling─the bucket feeling.
[Hortensia]
Buckets? What?
[Fogado]
My sister has a huge amount of responsibility...
And I can only help out in the smallest ways.
[Fogado]
It's like I'm trying to move a sand dune for her...
And all I've got is a bucket, you know?
[Hortensia]
Hmm... You're right.
[Hortensia]
Hm-hm.
[Hortensia]
Y'know, you're actually being pretty cool.
[Fogado]
I'm glad you noticed. Does that mean we're on
for tea?
[Hortensia]
Hehe, separate issue.
[Hortensia]
But I'll help you patrol the town all you want.
[Fogado]
Eh, I'll take it. Come on, then!
[Hortensia]
Let's go, bucket brigade.
