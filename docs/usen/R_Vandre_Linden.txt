=== Vander & Lindon ===

[Lindon]
Ugh...
[Vander]
Sir Lindon? Is something troubling you?
[Lindon]
I'm loath to admit it, but my lower back has
been giving me terrible pain lately.
[Lindon]
For all my training as a royal knight of Elusia,
I suppose there's no defeating old age.
[Vander]
What nonsense. You are a sage of no small
talent. I would say you haven't lost a step.
[Lindon]
You're right that my mind is as sharp as ever,
but physically, my decline has been just dismal.
[Lindon]
You're no spring chicken yourself, you know.
Can you really say you're as fit as ever?
[Vander]
...
[Vander]
I will not pretend that I still have the stamina
nor the reflexes of my prime.
[Vander]
But what I have lost in that regard, I have been
rewarded in experience.
[Vander]
Nothing is gained moaning about your age.
Do what you can with the body you have.
[Lindon]
Haha, very astute! I should take a page from
your book.
[Lindon]
I may be getting on in years, but damned if I'll
let the youth run rings around me!
[Vander]
There you go, Sir Lindon. Well said.
[Lindon]
Part of me wants to rest and relax in my
twilight years.
[Lindon]
But you've convinced me to squeeze just a little
more blood from this aging stone.

[Lindon]
Hmm...
[Vander]
Problems, Sir Lindon?
[Lindon]
I've found a very intriguing tome.
[Lindon]
With what's in here, I may be able to develop
a whole new type of magic.
[Vander]
That does sound interesting. What sort
of magic?
[Lindon]
You won't believe this, but it's a spell to restore
one's youth.
[Vander]
Surely such a spell could not actually exist.
Could it?
[Lindon]
It's still theoretical for now. I can't promise I'll
get results even if I work out the particulars.
[Lindon]
But if I succeed, we could fight just as ably as
our young comrades.
[Lindon]
I'm no slouch even as I am, but if I had my
youth back, I'd be a terror on the battlefield.
[Lindon]
And never mind the warâ”€magic like this would
change society as we know it.
[Lindon]
If I make any headway here, I promise that
you'll be first in line for the spell.
[Vander]
...
[Vander]
What you describe is a dream come true.
Yet I believe I shall decline.
[Lindon]
Why's that? Don't you want your lost
youth back?
[Vander]
I said before, I am satisfied to do what I can
with the body I have.
[Vander]
I pass on what I have learned to younger folk.
The world needs mentors as much as warriors.
[Lindon]
Huh...
[Lindon]
All right, all right. I commend you for sticking
by your principles.
[Lindon]
But if my work pans out, I wager you'll be
singing a different tune.
[Lindon]
Hm-hm, I suppose we'll see, won't we?

[Vander]
Sir Lindon. How has your work on rejuvenation
magic gone since last we spoke?
[Lindon]
Haha, the experiment failed dismally.
[Lindon]
I chalk it up to an error in the tome that first
piqued my interest.
[Lindon]
A spell to restore lost youth sounded too good
to be true, and so it was.
[Vander]
I see. How unfortunate.
[Lindon]
Honestly, I found myself a little relieved.
[Vander]
Why is that?
[Lindon]
"I have been rewarded in experience."
"The world needs mentors."
[Lindon]
As I set up my experiments, I recalled many
times what you'd said to me.
[Lindon]
In my younger days, I learned so much of what
I knew from the guidance of my elders.
[Lindon]
The idea of a world without such mentors in
it began to frighten me a bit.
[Lindon]
Then, too, growing older and losing my skills as
a knight taught me a few things.
[Lindon]
Perhaps it's only at our age that we become
capable of filling those roles.
[Vander]
Ah, you have finally seen the light.
[Vander]
A shame there was no one to drill such sense
into the scribe of that failed spell tome.
[Lindon]
The error was quite shocking when I realized.
Still, I reaped a bit of an unintended benefit.
[Vander]
Oh? Do tell.
[Lindon]
Do you notice anything, looking at me?
[Vander]
Hmm. You do seem a tad more sprightly than
when we last crossed paths.
[Lindon]
Very perceptive!
[Lindon]
In the course of my work, I did discover a minor
ritual that helped ease my back pain.
[Lindon]
Thanks to that, I feel fit as a fiddle!
[Vander]
Is this true?!
[Lindon]
Do I detect a hint of interest? Has a certain
someone's back been bothering him?
[Vander]
I was reluctant to admit it, but yes. You have
the right of it.
[Lindon]
Well then! Stay very still, Vander, and I'll
prepare the ritual for you as well.
[Lindon]
After all, mentoring the younger generations
will be easier if you're in shape for it.
[Vander]
Leave it to an Elusian sage to find success
even in failure.
[Lindon]
You flatter me, sir. Now, let's show those fresh-
faced soldiers what a few old fogies can do!
