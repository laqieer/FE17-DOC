[Alear]
Something about this place is really off...
[Leif]
It appears to be the River Thracia. Quite similar,
at least.
[Alear]
Is this someplace in your world?
[Leif]
In looks, it is quite close enough to a stretch of
ground where I once stood.
[Leif]
The River Thracia was a beautiful, broad river.
And it was the site of much bloodshed.
[Alear]
I can't imagine someplace as serene as this
turning into a battlefield.
[Leif]
This is where I faced the genius tactician Saias.
Some thought him a hero.
[Leif]
Reinhardt, a powerful man said to be the
crusader Thrud reborn, was there as well.
[Leif]
It was a difficult battle. Many were the moments
when I thought defeat was at hand.
[Alear]
So why does this place look like that?
[Leif]
I do not know for certain.
[Leif]
I sense a mighty force emanating from here.
This must be the trial appointed to you.
[Alear]
A...trial?
[Leif]
. I want you to fight me here.
[Leif]
If you overcome that trial, our bond will
grow stronger.
[Leif]
That bond will bring with it power we cannot do
without if we are to survive the battles ahead.
[Alear]
Winning a battle against you is my trial?
Understood.
[Leif]
Good. Victory is your only way forward.

[Leif]
You have become stronger since first we met,
my friend .
[Alear]
I feel like I still got a long way to go.
I appreciate your guidance.
[Leif]
Guidance? An interesting word choice.
[Leif]
I believe I understand now why the trial was
located here.
[Alear]
Oh? Why?
[Leif]
I was a young prince, inexperienced in leading
an army. My errors were many. Some fatal.
[Leif]
On the day of this battle, I was told something
I have kept in my thoughts ever since...
[Leif]
Once blood is spilled, it cannot return to its
source. Make that sacrifice worth something.
[Leif]
. Life is a series of choices.
[Leif]
There is no way for one to know if their past
choices were correct or a mistake.
[Leif]
All we can do is make the future into something
good and righteous. We must strive for that.
[Leif]
Such is the responsibility of a guide. And it is
what I learned in the place so like this one.
[Alear]
Thank you, Leif, for sharing your story with me.
I feel like I understand more than before.
[Alear]
I will work to build a good future. And you'll be
beside me until the end of this war?
[Leif]
Here, on the shores of this beautiful river,
I swear my service to you, .

[Leif]
I will stand my ground. No running. No hiding.
Now, come at me!

[Leif]
Now! Destroy the bridge!

[Leif]
Relax
[Leif]
I have been waiting, .
Are you prepared?

[Alear]
Of course, Leif! I will face you anywhere,
at any time.
[Leif]
Then let us begin. A fair battle between equals.

[Leif]
Be honest with yourself. What do you want?
What do you hope for, deep in your heart?

[Ivy]
But I... What if I fail again?
[Leif]
Life is not a simple path, and mistakes are only
mistakes. Set them right by making amends.
[Leif]
You have faced your own weaknesses before.
Do so again and you will only grow stronger.
