=== Alear & Vander ===

[Alear]
Phew, I've hit my limit for training today.
[Vander]
Excellent work, Divine One.
[Vander]
I brought a hot towel for your face. I think you
will find it most refreshing.
[Alear]
Thank you, Vander. That's very kind of you.
[Vander]
I have also prepared a fresh change of clothes
for you.
[Vander]
When you change, deposit your dirty clothes
into the basket, and I will wash them for you.
[Alear]
I appreciate your generosity, Vander, but I'd
prefer to take care of my own laundry.
[Alear]
Certainly you have other tasks to keep
you busy.
[Vander]
My only obligation is to you, Divine One. Feel
no hesitation in asking me for anything.
[Alear]
But...
[Vander]
It has been my duty to wait on you since long
before you awakened.
[Vander]
Were you to assume my duties for yourself, my
position would cease to exist.
[Vander]
So please, leave these trivialities to me─where
they belong─and trouble yourself no further.
[Alear]
Again, I appreciate your willingness to help me,
but I do feel a bit bad about all this.
[Vander]
There is nothing in all of Elyos to feel bad
about, Divine One.
[Vander]
Now I must insist you change out of your damp
clothes before you catch yourself a cold.

[Vander]
Divine One, I have finished repairing and
polishing your weapons.
[Alear]
Thank you, Vander.
[Vander]
I have also prepared all of the materials you will
require for the war council tomorrow.
[Vander]
Please do take a moment to review them
sometime today.
[Alear]
...
[Alear]
I'm sorry, but I can't do this.
[Vander]
Do what, precisely?
[Alear]
Vander, do you think I'm unreliable?
[Vander]
What? Goodness, no!
[Vander]
We are mortals, and you are the Divine One─
our magnificent leader, if you take my meaning.
[Vander]
For you to perform lowly tasks that are mine
to execute is most gracious, but uncalled for.
[Alear]
I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable having a
servant. That's not who I am.
[Vander]
Ah. Before I was your attendant, I was similarly
engaged in caring for Queen Lumera.
[Vander]
Your mother, perfect in mind and beauty, never
lodged a complaint regarding my services.
[Vander]
In time, Divine One, I hope that you will grow
accustomed to my work as your caretaker.
[Alear]
I respect my mother, and thank you for your
service to her. But...I'm not my mother.
[Alear]
I'm my own person. I'm capable. I can take care
of myself.
[Vander]
I see...
[Vander]
My apologies, Divine One. I have pushed myself
on you. An old servant's habit, I suppose.
[Vander]
I will honor your request and take more care
in considering your needs, moving forward.
[Alear]
Thank you, Vander. And, please, let me know
before you do anything on my behalf?
[Alear]
There are many times I will need your help.
But I'd like to ask for that help.

[Vander]
Shall I attend to your weapons and armor,
Divine One?
[Alear]
No need. I've got time, so I'll take care of
it myself.
[Vander]
Understood. Then I shall turn my attention to
other tasks, by your leave.
[Alear]
Thank you for being so diligent.
[Vander]
Of course, Divine One. It is nothing. Nothing
at all...
[Alear]
Is something troubling you?
[Vander]
May I have but a moment of your time?
[Alear]
You may. What is it?
[Vander]
Some time back, Divine One, you spoke of how
you and Queen Lumera are different people.
[Vander]
Having served humbly beneath you both, I have
observed quite a few similarities.
[Vander]
In fact, I observed some of your similarities
just now.
[Alear]
How so?
[Vander]
You are thoughtful and kind to everyone─in
turn you are well loved by all you meet.
[Vander]
If there is any difference between you, I think it
is only that you are still growing.
[Vander]
You have a bright, limitless future ahead. It is
my desire to support you in that future.
[Alear]
Vander, I...
[Vander]
I hope that I have not offended you. I wanted
only to speak from the heart.
[Alear]
No, I'm happy you opened up to me like this.
It's as you say, I've still got a lot to learn.
[Alear]
If I grow enough, hopefully I'll become more
like my mother─someone people can count on.
[Vander]
I am certain that you can and you will, Divine
One. That is why I am here, serving you.
[Alear]
As long as you're with me─guiding me─I can
also feel certain that things will work out.
[Alear]
Please continue to lend me your strength.
Someday, when I'm stronger, I'll lend you mine.
[Vander]
Of course, Divine One.

[Vander]
Divine One. I must admit to you a
grave confession.
[Alear]
Oh? Go on...
[Vander]
As I wish to continue serving you, I feel it is
prudent to tell you everything.
[Vander]
When first I was dispatched to the Somniel to
serve you, I was unhappy at the prospect.
[Alear]
You were?
[Vander]
Indeed. Prior to serving you, all I wanted was to
serve Queen Lumera until the very end.
[Vander]
Despite my many protestations, Queen Lumera
insisted I watch over you in your slumber.
[Vander]
I felt I was cast aside─useless as her servant.
I arrived at the Somniel under a dark cloud...
[Alear]
I see... So what caused such a change of heart?
[Vander]
Initially, I was simply carrying out Queen
Lumera's orders.
[Vander]
But now I serve you because I believe in who
you are─your heart and your will, Divine One.
[Alear]
Vander...
[Vander]
It wasn't until Queen Lumera passed that I
realized she knew her time was short.
[Vander]
That is why she appointed me as your caretaker
and directed me to assist you.
[Vander]
To be entrusted with Queen Lumera's child is
the highest honor for any steward.
[Vander]
In my own foolishness, I failed to see it then.
But I see it now. For this, I must apologize.
[Alear]
There is nothing to apologize for. Thank you for
speaking so honestly with me, Vander.
[Vander]
Divine One, would you grant me the honor to
swear my allegiance to you once more?
[Alear]
Of course.
[Vander]
Divine One, I hereby pledge to you my
undying loyalty.
[Alear]
Vander, I recognize you as my steadfast knight.
[Alear]
To honor that, I would like to give you this.
[Vander]
The Pact Ring? Such a precious thing cannot
possibly be given to me!
[Alear]
Of course it can. I want you to have it.
[Alear]
This ring is handed down among Divine
Dragons, representing a special bond with them.
[Alear]
So there is no one more fitting than you, who
has served both me and my mother tirelessly.
[Vander]
To think...that I might one day be granted
such an honor.
[Alear]
Hah, I recall you saying something similar when
I first awoke. You've been with me ever since.
[Alear]
Now I ask that you stand with me until the
very end.
[Vander]
It is my honor! Divine One, I will follow you,
even unto the ends of the world.
[Vander]
To be truly worthy of this ring, I will never again
allow any harm to befall you.
[Vander]
I, Vander, swear to protect you. I will be your
sword and shield, even should it cost me my life.
