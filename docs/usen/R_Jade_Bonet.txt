[Bunet] 
Jade? What are you doing?
[Jade] 兜あり 
Practicing mindfulness.
[Bunet] 
Ah... I heard a rumor that you deal with stress 
by meditating in your armor. Seems it was true.
[Jade] 兜あり 
Did you need help with something?
[Bunet] 
It's just that you look so appetizing.
[Jade] 兜あり 
Excuse me?
[Bunet] 
Your armor-clad stillness─it calls to mind one 
of my favorite dishes.
[Bunet] 
You take a crabshell, stuff it with vegetables, 
meats, and rice, and stew it for three days.
[Bunet] 
Oh... I'm getting hungry.
[Jade] 兜あり 
You're making it difficult to meditate, Bunet.
[Bunet] 
Aw, I can almost taste them...
[Bunet] 
Those hearty bites of sumptuous stuffed crab...
[Jade] 兜あり 
Please go away, Bunet.
[Bunet] 
Oh, was I bothering you? Farewell, then.
[Bunet] 
[Jade] 兜あり 
...
[Jade] 兜あり 
Now I'm getting hungry.

[Bunet] 
Good news, Jade. I am going to treat you to 
that stuffed crab stew we discussed.
[Jade] 
I don't recall any such discussion.
[Bunet] 
"Jade's Repose." That would be a good name 
for it, don't you think?
[Jade] 
Oh. Right. I remember now.
[Jade] 
You kept talking at me while I meditated inside 
my armor. Then you compared me to seafood.
[Jade] 
It involved something like...cramming different 
ingredients into crab shells.
[Bunet] 
Yes, yes. Anyway, that armor of yours... 
May I have a lick?
[Jade] 
This conversation is over.
[Bunet] 
Your armor may prove to be an interesting 
substitute for a crab shell. So much room...
[Bunet] 
At what heat does one stew metal, I wonder?
[Jade] 
You're not getting anywhere near my armor.
[Jade] 
You're also...very obviously not listening to me.
[Bunet] 
Come again? Oh, yes. Sorry.
[Jade] 
I will admit, this chat is making me very hungry. 
Are you going to cook that stew or not?
[Bunet] 
Yes, of course. Nothing is finer than sharing a 
meal with a friend.
[Jade] 
Yes, as long as that's all this arrangement is─a 
friend sampling the cooking of another friend.
[Bunet] 
Good. Then I will get cooking.
[Bunet] 
But first, just a quick taste of that armor...
[Jade] 
No!

[Jade] 
Bunet, do you have a spare moment?
[Bunet] 
Ah, Jade. I do.
[Bunet] 
Is that a flower I smell?
[Jade] 
I wanted to thank you for cooking that delicious 
meal the other day. This flower is for you.
[Bunet] 
For me?
[Bunet] 
I'm touched. Would you be offended if I took 
a little nibble from one of the petals?
[Jade] 
You want to know what flowers from a friend 
taste like, right?
[Bunet] 
I didn't realize you had taken up mind reading.
[Jade] 
I've experienced enough of your habits to 
detect a pattern.
[Bunet] 
I see. Well, understanding cuts both ways.
[Bunet] 
Here. Look.
[Jade] 
Wow. This food looks amazing. Why did you 
prepare all of this?
[Bunet] 
I anticipated that you might come thank me.
[Bunet] 
In preparation, I went ahead and made this 
modest feast for you.
[Jade] 
Thank you, Bunet.
[Jade] 
Is this our dynamic now? Thanking each other 
back and forth through polite gestures?
[Bunet] 
Strong friendships have been built on less.
[Jade] 
I suppose it does offer a reliable framework... 
with defined boundaries.
[Bunet] 
Agreed. Now that that's settled, I'll just...
[Jade] 
Touch my armor and you're a dead man.
[Bunet] 
Heh. Fair enough.
