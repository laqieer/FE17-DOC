=== Leif & Alfred ===

--- C ---



[Alfred]
Nng, ngh, hyah... Another solid morning's
training done with!
[Leif]
How driven he must be to begin his training so
early in the morning! I must follow his example.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Why are you staring so intently at your arm?
[Alfred]
Just checking in with my body. My arms say
everything's A-OK! How about you, Leif?

--- A ---



[Alfred]
I hide it well, but I was a pretty sickly kid. My
mother was always worried about my health.
[Leif]
It is your intense training that has brought you
your current, robust health, I take it?
[Alfred]
No doubt. I took it seriously and never missed
a single workout session.
[Leif]
I could learn a lot from your dedication and how
you overcome your problems without giving up.

=== Leif & Anna ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
Have I...met you before?
[Anna]
I'm Lady Anna, a traveling merchant! I sell only
the best, so snap it up now or regret it later!

--- B ---



[Leif]
I see you are in high spirits again today,
Lady Anna. Are you off to market?
[Anna]
Yep! Today I'm rolling out a special membership
program for repeat customers.

--- A ---



[Leif]
Why did you decide to join our cause?
[Anna]
Finding my family was a big part of it. Plus, if
the world ends, my business goes kaput too.
[Anna]
I figure people will be so happy when the war
ends that they'll be willing to spend big!
[Leif]
Ha! You think big yourself, for one so small.
I suspect you are correct.

=== Leif & Bunet ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
I am called Sage Lord, but have much to learn.
I hope you may teach me a thing or two.
[Bunet]
The Sage Lord...what a delicious title. I'm sure
we can learn a great deal from each other, Leif.

--- B ---



[Bunet]
I use my sense of taste to learn about the world.
So, might I taste the glowing light around you?
[Leif]
You want to taste...the light? I wonder... Does
each Emblem's glow have a unique flavor?

--- A ---



[Leif]
You want to make a dish...out of the glowy light
emitted by Emblems? Is this even possible?
[Bunet]
So far, I haven't been able to capture the glow,
but I am certain it will taste delicious when I do.
[Bunet]
Which is why I need you, Leif. I need you to use
all your might to glow as brightly as you can.
[Leif]
I am not convinced this glow of mine will taste
good. But for you Bunet, I will glow my best!

=== Leif & Boucheron ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
Boucheron? What are you doing here?
[Boucheron]
The horse I was using as a landmark ran off.
Could you tell me the way back to the prince?

--- B ---



[Leif]
Have you lost your way again? Alfred was
looking for you.
[Boucheron]
So I keep hearing. If he doesn't stay put, we
might be going in circles like this forever.

--- A ---




[Boucheron]
You're not busy today, are you, Leif? Want to
come fishing with me?
[Leif]
A fine idea. The weather is perfect for it.
[Leif]
And you shall need me along to prevent you
from becoming lost on the way.
[Boucheron]
Hahaha, guilty as charged. Whether in or out of
battle, I'd always be lost without you.

=== Leif & Céline ===

--- C ---




[Céline]
I shall need your aid, Leif, if I hope to protect
my beloved Firene─let alone the world.
[Leif]
You will have it, Céline. Let us fight so that the
people can be secure in a peaceful world.

--- B ---




[Céline]
Won't you join me for tea? I've acquired a
batch of the finest leaves in Firene.
[Leif]
They smell incredible. Like flowers, and the
sun, and the rich, fertile ground...

--- A ---



[Leif]
Whatever has put you in such a good mood?
[Céline]
A new shoot sprouted in the courtyard flower
bed. And I had a lovely cup of tea earlier today.
[Céline]
These small joys are to be cherished. I hope you
don't think me childish for that.
[Leif]
Never! You have taught me that a happy life is
built from the slow accumulation of small joys.

=== Leif & Chloé ===

--- C ---



[Chloé]
I think the thing that makes you most like a
fairy-tale hero is your bright, shining armor.
[Leif]
I am no hero, though. That role was foisted
upon me by others.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Whatever are you eating, Chloé?
[Chloé]
A large snake boiled in medicinal herbs.
I'm really sorry I can't share with you.

--- A ---



[Chloé]
Hey, Leif, don't go too overboard, OK?
[Leif]
What brought on the sudden bout of concern?
[Chloé]
Well, you always seem a little tense. Relax!
I'm here for you.
[Leif]
I am still not quite used to this world, I suppose.
Your help will get me there. Thank you, Chloé.

=== Leif & Citrinne ===

--- C ---




[Citrinne]
Oh! I'm sorry, Leif. You must have thought I
was glaring at you. That's just my resting face.
[Leif]
That was not my thinking at all, Citrinne.
You have a very kind aura about you.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Tell me, Citrinne, why did you want to become
one of Alcryst's retainers?
[Citrinne]
He's my cousin. I wanted to protect him, so
I spoke with my family and... Well, here I am!

--- A ---




[Citrinne]
I became Alcryst's retainer through my family's
connections. My actual skills are...rather lacking.
[Citrinne]
I'm working hard to improve, but everyone else
is so strong. I don't think I'll ever catch up.
[Leif]
Try not to rush yourself. Strength in battle is
not something you can achieve overnight.
[Leif]
Besides, your allies count on you for more than
sheer strength. That is certainly true of me.

=== Leif & Clanne ===

--- C ---



[Clanne]
Lord Leif, do you have any suggestions for how
to be someone the Divine Dragon can rely on?
[Leif]
I think you have more to teach me in that
respect than I have to offer you.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Clanne, you are busy as ever today. Is all of
your effort in the name of the Divine Dragon?
[Clanne]
Yes! It takes a lot of work to make sure the
Divine Dragon gets enough rest.

--- A ---



[Leif]
I heard Framme using a word─"venerable."
It means more than simply being "likable," yes?
[Clanne]
True. It's a bit more than just being likable.
[Clanne]
It's more like saying you respect somebody
because they're full of wisdom.
[Leif]
I see. There are truly strong feelings attached to
the word. I shall try to use it sometime soon.

=== Leif & Diamant ===

--- C ---



[Diamant]
It's such an honor to be speaking with you, Leif.
I have much to discuss regarding my kingdom...
[Leif]
I look forward to working with you as well,
Diamant. I am happy to help however I can.

--- B ---



[Diamant]
The people of Elusia deeply resent my country.
I need to foster peace between our nations.
[Leif]
Do not rush. I believe you are the best person to
find a way forward, but these things take time.

--- A ---



[Diamant]
The truth is, I'm not as confident as I may seem.
I've never told anyone that─not even Alcryst.
[Leif]
I once lacked confidence...but my friends guided
me and helped my heart grow much stronger.
[Leif]
You have great friends too, Diamant. This quest
is how you will grow, and I will be by your side.
[Diamant]
Thank you, Leif. I'll strive to become a king as
wise as you...the Sage Lord himself.

=== Leif & Etie ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
Etie, are you all right?! I heard an unearthly
noise.
[Etie]
Sorry about that! I was training a little too hard
and accidentally took out a wall.

--- B ---




[Etie]
You look a little nervous. You know what helps
with that? Weight training!
[Leif]
I may as well. I doubt I can develop any muscle,
but it should be invigorating anyway.

--- A ---



[Leif]
Seeing the things you put yourself through in
the name of training is rather daunting.
[Etie]
It's not for the faint of heart, that's for sure.
But I've got a secret weapon.
[Etie]
It's a Firenese muscle balm. It boosts the effects
of your training, no matter who you are.
[Leif]
But even with that, you still have to train, right?
If only you could cut that part out entirely...

=== Leif & Fogado ===

--- C ---




[Fogado]
All right, all right! It's time to do my rounds.
I tell you, I am no good at sitting still.
[Leif]
If you are going on patrol, I shall join you. It will
be nice to have a chat off the battlefield.

--- B ---




[Fogado]
You know, my sister is real tough. Still, I can't
help but feel like I should protect her.
[Leif]
I know how you feel. I would want to help my
sister as well. Siblings are like that.

--- A ---




[Fogado]
So, Leif, um...are you good at fishing? And if
you are, would you mind teaching me?
[Leif]
Teach you to fish? You do not know how?
[Fogado]
I know. Seems like I should, but I don't. Please,
you're the only one I'm comfortable asking.
[Leif]
Haha, in that case, I am pleased you asked.
I may not teach you well, but I will teach you!

=== Leif & Framme ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
You look as if you are deep in concentration.
Whatever could have you so preoccupied?
[Framme]
I'm making an outfit to celebrate how great the
Divine Dragon is!

--- B ---



[Leif]
You are training again today, Framme? Your
tireless efforts are most impressive!
[Framme]
I gotta be in tip-top shape for praying to the
Divine One. My prayers are very athletic.

--- A ---



[Framme]
OK, what we do now is wait at that corner for
the Divine One to pass by.
[Framme]
Yes. The line of sight seems like it'd be perfect.
Is it really OK to bring you along for this stuff?
[Leif]
Of course! I asked you to, remember? I enjoy
learning about your unusual style of worship.
[Leif]
They're coming. Let's go, Framme. It will be the
best angle to see from, do you agree?

=== Leif & Goldmary ===

--- C ---



[Goldmary]
You know, Leif, I wouldn't blame you if you
began to develop feelings for me.
[Leif]
I already have feelings about you, Goldmary.
I think you and I will make good friends.

--- B ---



[Goldmary]
I'm sorry if my dazzling grace distracts you
in battle. I'm afraid it's out of my control.
[Leif]
No need to apologize. If by some chance I were
distracted, it would be my fault, not yours.

--- A ---



[Leif]
Is something the matter? You seem dejected.
[Goldmary]
I am thinking of all the distraction I've inflicted
on others in battle with my alluring elegance.
[Goldmary]
Is it selfish that I want you to notice how
charming I am, even in the middle of a war?
[Leif]
Do not trouble yourself over that, Goldmary.
You are a fine ally to have on the battlefield.

=== Leif & Hortensia ===

--- C ---



[Hortensia]
You've seen my sister fight up close, Leif.
I know she's good. How do I measure up?
[Leif]
Your skills are impressive indeed. I look forward
to seeing more of your work on the battlefield.

--- B ---



[Leif]
It is time to move out, Hortensia. Are you
ready? Is something wrong with your head?
[Hortensia]
I'm trying to get my hair right! You don't expect
me to go to battle looking like this, do you?

--- A ---



[Hortensia]
Do you think it's OK to believe what I want,
even if my country worships the Fell Dragon?
[Leif]
If you are asking me that, I would say you must
already have the answer you seek.
[Hortensia]
Ugh, way to avoid the question. Can you just
give me some validation, please?
[Leif]
Haha, I think you should do what you feel is
right, and I am happy to help you decide that.

=== Leif & Ivy ===

--- C ---




[Ivy]
Having your power used against your will...
You must be furious.
[Leif]
Nothing of the sort, Ivy. I am honored to fight
at your side.

--- B ---




[Ivy]
There is so much to be done, and yet I only
seem capable of wallowing in my own regrets.
[Leif]
Honest introspection is never easy. But take
heart─you will make a fine queen.

--- A ---




[Ivy]
I wish I could be more like you and the Divine
One. You are both so honest and pure.
[Ivy]
I want people to believe me─to believe in me.
It sounds ridiculous saying it out loud.
[Leif]
It is not ridiculous at all. In fact, I would argue
this wish of yours has already come true.
[Leif]
You are surrounded by friends and allies,
are you not? They believe in you. As do I.

=== Leif & Jade ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
Jade? I can feel you staring at me... Do I have
something on my face?
[Jade]
Huh? No. Sorry, Leif. I was lost in a new story
idea, but...it's gone now.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Whatever is the matter, Jade? You look as if
something has upset you.
[Jade]
Huh? No, I'm fine. In fact, I'm in a particularly
good mood. Is it that hard to tell?

--- A ---




[Jade]
Leif? Do you have a spare moment?
[Leif]
Yes, I have time right now. What would you like
to discuss?
[Jade]
I need a twist for my new novel. Are there any
tales from your world that might inspire me?
[Leif]
I see! I would be happy to assist. Let me begin
with the story of the 12 crusaders...

=== Leif & Jean ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
That last battle was rather vicious. Are you all
right, Jean?
[Jean]
Thanks for asking, but it'll take more than that
to discourage me.

--- B ---



[Leif]
You did very well last time. It was due to your
efforts that we had no serious injuries.
[Jean]
I can patch people up, but what I'm working for
is a world where they don't get hurt.

--- A ---



[Jean]
How did you get to be so strong, Leif? I wish
I was more like you.
[Leif]
I wonder the same thing about others. Besides,
Jean, you are stronger than you know already.
[Jean]
It doesn't feel like that. I've put in the study and
practiced a lot, but I'm not a great doctor yet.
[Leif]
No need to hurry. Simply fix your eyes upon
your goal and reach it one step at a time.

=== Leif & Kagetsu ===

--- C ---



[Kagetsu]
Please ask if you need something, Leif. I am
always happy to help my dearest friends.
[Leif]
Thank you, Kagetsu. No one has called me
a dearest friend quite so quickly as you.

--- B ---



[Kagetsu]
You are well practiced in swordplay, are you
not? Come, show me your skill!
[Leif]
You would like to spar? All right. I will gladly
show you the swordsmanship of Leonster.

--- A ---



[Kagetsu]
Tell me more stories of your world, Leif.
I am very curious.
[Leif]
I have already told you almost all there is to tell.
I will run out of material very soon at this rate.
[Kagetsu]
My curiosity is not even close to running out!
Tell me more! I demand satisfaction!
[Leif]
Ha! Very well. Let me tell you of a battle which
hinged on the efficacy of murder holes...

=== Leif & Lapis ===

--- C ---



[Lapis]
Mmm, sugar water is such a great pick-me-up...
Ah! Leif?! Have you been here the whole time?
[Leif]
Incredible! There are so many ways to consume
sugar... You are so knowledgeable, Lapis.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Are you weeding during your break? You are
such a diligent worker, Lapis.
[Lapis]
I don't know about that. I'm just stocking up on
backup rations. I mean, uh... Yep! I'm weeding!

--- A ---



[Leif]
The country of Thracia was mostly barren land.
This led to wars between the north and south.
[Lapis]
I bet food was hard to come by out there. That
reminds me... Have you ever eaten bear?
[Leif]
We did not encounter many bears...but there
were plenty of wyverns.
[Lapis]
I've never tried wyvern... How do they taste?
How does their meat keep? Tell me more!

=== Leif & Lindon ===

--- C ---




[Lindon]
I'm Lindon. Pleased to meet you. You let these
old bones know if they can help you in any way.
[Leif]
You are more than your bones, I am sure. I am
very glad to have your help.

--- B ---



[Leif]
That portrait you carry with you everywhere...
Is that your wife?
[Lindon]
Ah, you noticed it, did you? What do you think?
She was quite the woman, you know.

--- A ---



[Leif]
Oh! That smells so good. Is it one of the
cookies you baked with magic?
[Lindon]
Haha! That it is. If only you could taste it!
[Leif]
The scent is enough for me. I am very intrigued
by your method of baking with magic.
[Lindon]
Magic can be a boon or a bane depending on
how you use it. I bake to remind people of that.

=== Leif & Louis ===

--- C ---



[Louis]
Is there anything I can do for you, Leif? Perhaps
find you a suitable partner for socializing?
[Leif]
Uh, that is quite all right, Louis. Thank you for
offering, though.

--- B ---



[Louis]
I've brewed some tea. Shall we enjoy it together
while admiring the scenery?
[Leif]
It smells most wonderful, Louis. I assume by
"scenery," you mean those people over there?

--- A ---



[Leif]
You have a grim look today, Louis. Is there
something wrong?
[Louis]
Yes. Try as I might, I'm having difficulty
completely fading into the background.
[Leif]
Ah, it would be a useful talent for setting up an
ambush. I have no advice for you, though.
[Louis]
I had thought more along the lines of observing
scenes play out naturally. But still, thank you.

=== Leif & Alear ===

--- C ---




[Alear]
I fight to save the world that my mother loved.
But I'll need your help, Leif.
[Leif]
If it can bring about the peace you desire so
strongly, then my sword arm is yours!

--- B ---




[Alear]
It's hard knowing that my mother loved me so
much, but I can never repay her kindness.
[Leif]
It is enough that you express those feelings.
Somewhere, your mother is surely listening.

--- A ---




[Alear]
Am I doing enough in your opinion, Leif? I feel
like everyone expects so much of me...
[Leif]
It is hard to bear such a burden on your own.
Focus not on your failings, but your strengths.
[Alear]
My strengths?
[Leif]
People believe in you. They follow you. Show
them a path to peace, and they will walk it.

=== Leif & Mauvier ===

--- C ---



[Mauvier]
Sir Leif, your combat skills are impressive. Is it
inconvenient to ask we join forces again, soon?
[Leif]
No inconvenience at all. I will happily fight at
your side any day.

--- B ---



[Mauvier]
This place and these people...are too kind.
Dealing with such behavior is confusing.
[Leif]
Where lies the confusion? You are their ally, and
they assume they are yours.

--- A ---



[Mauvier]
Protecting those I hold dear is my goal. Yet, so
often my decision making is poor.
[Leif]
It is too early to know the impact of all your
choices. Your story is far from over.
[Leif]
Trust your instincts─act to protect your friends.
[Mauvier]
Thank you. You are correct. My doubts cloud
my judgment, and they shall be abandoned.

=== Leif & Merrin ===

--- C ---



[Merrin]
Sir Leif, I wonder if we could discuss the recent
battle? I'd like your honest opinion on a matter.
[Leif]
Of course! I am always happy to provide
whatever knowledge or insight I can.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Merrin, I have noticed you carefully observing
animals on several occasions. Why is that?
[Merrin]
I like to study things I admire. In fact, I have
studied you on occasion as well, Sir Leif.

--- A ---



[Merrin]
When we finally have peace, I plan to travel. My
dream is to see animals no one has seen before.
[Merrin]
I've traveled some, of course, but there's still so
much to see. Sir Leif, what do you dream of?
[Leif]
I suppose I dream of seeing my hometown
flourishing and at peace.
[Leif]
But that is my dream as a king. Perhaps I should
find my own personal dream just as you have.

=== Leif & Timerra ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
A pleasure to meet you, Timerra. I vow to do
my best and earn your friendship along the way.
[Timerra]
Pleasure's all mine. Oh, I just thought of a song!
♪La-la-Leif, he's better than deep-fried beef!♪

--- B ---




[Timerra]
You gotta appreciate a lady with a sense
of style, am I right?
[Leif]
Oh, uh, yes. I once cherished a lady who
I thought to be quite stylish.

--- A ---



[Leif]
Is something amiss, Timerra? You have not been
singing of late. That is quite unusual for you.
[Timerra]
Oh, Leif. I wrote this new song about how much
I love Emblems, but no one wants to listen to it.
[Leif]
About Emblems, you say? As an Emblem
myself, I would be happy to have a listen.
[Timerra]
Really?! You're the best. I'm gonna belt it out
straight from the heart just for you! Here goes...

=== Leif & Pandreo ===

--- C ---




[Pandreo]
Ah, Lord Leif! I─ I'm so nervous. I haven't even
greeted you. Here goes... AROOO!
[Leif]
AROO! That is your greeting? The etiquette
traditions in this country are strange indeed.

--- B ---




[Pandreo]
Lord Leif, I understand your parents passed
away. Would it be OK if I prayed for them?
[Leif]
So very thoughtful of you, Pandreo. I believe
my mother and father would appreciate it.

--- A ---



[Leif]
You seem unusually busy today. Are you
preparing for some kind of event?
[Pandreo]
Yes, in fact! I'm preparing for a banquet.
A banquet...to celebrate our friendship!
[Pandreo]
There's a seat just for you. It's the one with
all the decorations. There's a card for you too.
[Leif]
It says, "Thank you for everything." Ah, you are
too kind. I should be thanking you, Pandreo.

=== Leif & Panette ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
Panette! Why is there an insect trapped inside
that bottle?
[Panette]
Because I plan to keep it, that's why. Just look
at it! Its colors are truly splendid to behold.

--- B ---




[Panette]
Time to pull these lousy weeds. Get outta here!
Oh, Leif! However might I be of service to you?
[Leif]
Oh, well, I thought I might help you with the
gardening. But you seem to have it well in hand.

--- A ---




[Panette]
You have arrived at a most opportune time. I am
about to have a snack. Would you join me?
[Leif]
Yes, thank you. Though I will have to enjoy the
smell only. Are you eating those red...things?
[Panette]
Indeed, I am! They are my favorite chips. I'm
told some people find their smell quite unusual.
[Leif]
Gah! Unusual...yes...quite. You do enjoy some
peculiar things.

=== Leif & Rosado ===

--- C ---




[Rosado]
Cuteness is the highest virtue. I've never seen
a cute thing I didn't love.
[Leif]
There is something to be said for simple and
straightforward values. Good for you.

--- B ---



[Leif]
What motivates you to be a soldier, Rosado?
There is nothing cute about war.
[Rosado]
Of course not. But I fight so everyone can have
the chance to be cute.

--- A ---




[Rosado]
It's time we realized the full potential of your
cuteness, Leif. Take a look at this!
[Leif]
That is quite a colorful outfit. And a very nice
wig, as well. Are these...for me?
[Rosado]
Of course! Cuteness is the highest virtue,
remember. Do your part for the cause, OK?
[Leif]
Regrettably, I cannot. As fine as these may be,
I lack the physical form needed to wear them.

=== Leif & Saphir ===

--- C ---




[Saphir]
Have I got something on my face, Leif?
You're staring.
[Leif]
Forgive me─you simply remind me of someone.
A strong woman who was very dear to me.

--- B ---




[Saphir]
War is horrible, but that's exactly why we have
to fight. I don't want to lose anyone else.
[Leif]
I feel the same way. War may be a tragedy, but
we must fight to prevent an even greater one.

--- A ---



[Leif]
Saphir, what are you doing with that fish?
[Saphir]
I got it from a friend, but even if I cook it, it's
too much for one person to eat.
[Leif]
I am sure I could track down a few people who
would be happy to enjoy your cooking.
[Saphir]
Hehe, thanks. If we're having a feast, though,
I'd better use a fancier recipe.

=== Leif & Seadall ===

--- C ---




[Seadall]
You should watch me dance, Leif. I've read your
fortune, and it says dancing will bring you luck.
[Leif]
Oh? Your fortune-telling accuracy is renowned.
I shall be sure to see your performance.

--- B ---




[Seadall]
Tempting as it is, I avoid food that is not the
perfect fuel for my dance. This, for instance...
[Leif]
I see lots of oil, butter, sugar... That does
look delicious.

--- A ---



[Leif]
You seem so full of confidence, Seadall.
But you still evade savory treats, correct?
[Seadall]
Think nothing of it. My dancing is strong, and
puts a smile on the face of all who see it.
[Seadall]
But, Leif, I have seen Le Chariot in your fortune.
You have evaded much yourself. Grief, perhaps?
[Leif]
I have. But that is where I get my strength from.
I will make the people I lost proud of who I am.

=== Leif & Alcryst ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
Hello, Alcryst. Have you been enjoying this
gentle weather? I certainly have.
[Alcryst]
Are you talking to me?! Oh, Leif, your kind
heart makes me so nervous. I'm not worthy.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Why are you standing so far away, Alcryst?
Please, come a little closer.
[Alcryst]
So majestic... So regal... Huh? Oh! No thank
you, Leif. I'm fine back here in your periphery.

--- A ---




[Alcryst]
Brodia is known for its precious gems, but I
fight for our people. They're the real treasure.
[Leif]
That sounds like the mindset of a true leader.
Brodia's citizens must be proud of you, Alcryst.
[Alcryst]
N-no, that can't be true. How could they? If the
citizens are like gems, I'm more like...a pebble.
[Leif]
You place value in your country's people. I am
sure they value you in return...and so do I.

=== Leif & Amber ===

--- C ---




[Amber]
I'm Amber, one of Prince Diamant's retainers.
You can call me the alpaca-wrangling master!
[Leif]
The alpaca-wrangling master, you say...
That has a curiously pleasant ring to it.

--- B ---



[Leif]
You seem to be in high spirits today, Amber.
You receive some good news?
[Amber]
I found a recipe for a legendary secret potion
that gives you endless energy! Wanna see, Leif?

[Amber]
I want to create an entire battalion of alpacas,
but I can't get Prince Diamant to sign off on it...
[Leif]
Hmm... If I were Diamant, I would surely prefer
horses. Alpacas may be difficult to mobilize.
[Leif]
What unique strengths do alpacas have? If you
lead with those, he might be easier to convince.
[Amber]
Oh, there are so many! Like, um...uh... Oh!
Their cuteness! It'll sap an enemy's will to fight!

[Vander]
Sir Leif, please, would you offer some guidance
to the Divine Dragon? It seems needed.
[Leif]
Gladly. If I can help, I will do so.

--- B ---




[Vander]
The Divine Dragon's sometimes-reckless
behavior can put quite a fright in me.
[Leif]
Understandable, though danger is a fact of life.
It's our job to keep that danger in check.

--- A ---



[Leif]
I see an old friend when I look at you. Sadly, his
death was a result of my carelessness.
[Leif]
He sacrificed everything to fulfill my wishes.
And I could give him nothing in return...
[Vander]
I do not know this person, but I imagine they
were proud to have served you.
[Vander]
To have someone in their life who was both lord
and friend? A rare blessing indeed.

=== Leif & Veyle ===

[Veyle]
I have done terrible things to you, Leif, and to
the others. You must hate fighting beside me.
[Leif]
I do not hate it, Veyle, I assure you. You are a
welcome partner on the battlefield and off.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Those look delicious, though that hint of red
makes me think them too fiery for my tastes.
[Veyle]
You have a good eye! These sweets are very
spicy. Hmm, I guess I better not share them.

--- A ---



[Leif]
Veyle? Did you need me for something?
[Veyle]
Leif, I've been so happy fighting by your side.
I...I hope you'll always be my comrade in arms.
[Leif]
Of course I will, Veyle. I will be your comrade-
in-arms... No, your friend, now and forever.
[Veyle]
Oh, thank you! I promise I'll do everything I can
and make you proud to stand by my side.

=== Leif & Yunaka ===

--- C ---



[Yunaka]
Y'know, Leif, I get the feeling you've been
through some tough stuff. I respect that.
[Leif]
The feeling is mutual, Yunaka. I admire your
fighting spirit.

--- B ---



[Leif]
I heard quite a strange cackle coming from this
direction. What is going on, Yunaka?
[Yunaka]
Oh, not much─just got my hands on some of
the deadliest weaponry you've ever seen.

--- A ---



[Yunaka]
Ugh... Think I did one too many impressions.
Throat's killing me.
[Leif]
Yes, you may have overdone it. I wish I could
offer you a restorative drink from my homeland.
[Leif]
That stuff could heal any ailment. It would have
fixed you right up.
[Yunaka]
I can pretend. Power of imagination, right?
Keep describing it. I'll tell you when it works.

=== Leif & Zelkov ===

--- C ---



[Leif]
You are always in a rush to find something to
do after a battle, Zelkov. Are you all right?
[Zelkov]
Your concern is unwarranted. I am simply
returning to the pursuits which *sustain* me.

--- B ---



[Leif]
Perhaps you could teach me how to make
medicine. It would be useful for me to know.
[Zelkov]
Absolutely not. Making medicine is my *role.*
What would I do if you replaced me?

--- A ---




[Zelkov]
What do you *intend* to do next, after we have
achieved our aims?
[Leif]
When all is done, and there is no more reason to
call on me, I suppose I will return to my ring.
[Zelkov]
Does the notion of *idleness* therein not
trouble you? Are you even conscious in there?
[Leif]
It is like sleeping. Perhaps I will content myself
to dream of the time we spent together.
