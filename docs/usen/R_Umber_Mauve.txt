[Mauvier] 
Hm.
[Amber] 
Mauvier? Are you still on guard duty? It's so 
late! I'll take over so you can get some rest.
[Mauvier] 
There is no need. The lateness of the hour is 
not of any concern.
[Amber] 
Really? Wow. I've gotta hand it to you.
[Mauvier] 
Why is that?
[Amber] 
You've been standing at attention for who 
knows how long! Don't you need a break?
[Mauvier] 
Keeping guard is more important than resting.
[Amber] 
Whoa! You can't say that! You've gotta take a 
real break!
[Mauvier] 
There is no need. Resting is a waste of time.
[Amber] 
OK, you're starting to scare me. How do you 
shake off your fatigue?
[Mauvier] 
Fatigue is no issue.
[Amber] 
What? What are you, one of the Corrupted 
or something?
[Amber] 
Enough joking around. It's my shift, so I'll take 
over from here. For real.
[Mauvier] 
No, thank you.
[Amber] 
Oh, come on, man! I didn't want to do this, but 
I'll have to relieve you by force...
[Amber] 
Urgh!
[Mauvier] 
What is wrong?
[Amber] 
I think...I pulled...a muscle.
[Mauvier] 
Heh, it looks like you're the one who needs 
to rest.

[Mauvier] 
Hm-hm.
[Amber] 
Hey, Mauvier. On guard duty again today? 
Want some company?
[Mauvier] 
And how is your pulled muscle treating you?
[Amber] 
Haha, that was no big deal. Heh, I healed up in 
no time!
[Mauvier] 
I see. That's g─ Ngh...good.
[Amber] 
Mauvier?
[Mauvier] 
Do not worry. I am fine.
[Amber] 
That didn't sound like "fine." Sit down. I'll go 
grab some water!
[Amber] 
How's that? Better?
[Mauvier] 
Yes, thanks to you. I suppose I was a little tired 
after all.
[Amber] 
Haha, I knew it. I'm honestly relieved to hear 
you admit it.
[Mauvier] 
Hm?
[Amber] 
That means you're human after all! I had my 
doubts. Stop pushing yourself so hard, OK?
[Mauvier] 
Haha, I surrender to your concerns.
[Amber] 
Yeah, you do. Here, drink some of this. It's a 
legendary secret potion that relieves fatigue.
[Mauvier] 
Really? Hm. This smell is worrisome.
[Amber] 
Worrisome? What?
[Mauvier] 
This is no secret potion to help with fatigue. 
It is a laxative.
[Amber] 
Huh? No way!
[Mauvier] 
Where did you come by that bottle? I nearly 
took a drink.
[Amber] 
Yeah, close call. Haha... Ah... Hah...
[Mauvier] 
What is wrong?
[Amber] 
I may have, um...taste-tested it earlier...
[Mauvier] 
Hm?
[Amber] 
Ah! Oh no! It's working─I can feel it WORKING!
[Mauvier] 
So, once again, it is you who needs to take a 
break while I continue guard duty.
[Mauvier] 
Go and rest. I will return to my watch.
[Amber] 
Please... Don't tell Jade...

[Amber] 
Mauvier! Buddy! Guard duty AGAIN? You can't 
be stopped, can you?
[Mauvier] 
How is your stomach treating you today?
[Amber] 
Oh, that? Haha, it's doing OK. How about you? 
Not feeling tired anymore?
[Mauvier] 
As I always say, do not worry about me.
[Amber] 
Man, you are such a trooper.
[Amber] 
...
[Amber] 
Does it ever...bother you? That you worked for 
the enemy before this, I mean?
[Mauvier] 
What you are asking is best left undiscussed.
[Amber] 
I knew it. Guilt is totally your thing, isn't it?
[Mauvier] 
...
[Mauvier] 
It would be a lie to say otherwise.
[Mauvier] 
It is a simple task to make others lose faith in 
you. Earning it back is far more difficult.
[Amber] 
Oh! That's why you've been putting in so much 
hard work!
[Amber] 
You don't have to worry. Everybody knows 
you're on our side now.
[Mauvier] 
Only because you tell everyone that I work hard 
and am dedicated to the cause.
[Amber] 
Huh?! H-how did you know that?
[Mauvier] 
It is not difficult to hear what people are talking 
about when our numbers are so small.
[Amber] 
I guess we both found each other out.
[Mauvier] 
It is strange how I find myself in a better mood 
when you are around.
[Mauvier] 
When I see you, I always know I am in the 
presence of a friend.
[Amber] 
That tracks. A lot of people say my affability 
is my only redeeming quality.
[Mauvier] 
Haha, is that what they say?
[Amber] 
Pretty much. I guess we hadn't really talked to 
each other before these last few nights, huh?
[Amber] 
There's still plenty of time before dawn breaks. 
Wanna chat?
[Mauvier] 
Yes. That sounds like good fun.
[Amber] 
OK! Affable Amber's gonna make you smile till 
sunup! If, uh, my rowdy guts let me, that is. Oof.
