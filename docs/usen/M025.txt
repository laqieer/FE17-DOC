=== Chapter 25 The Final Guardian ===

(Gradlon Temple)
After meeting the Divine Dragon's
past self, only one shard remains.
But a dark surprise lies in wait...

--- OP ---




[Alear]
So...the last Fell Dragon Shard is here?
In Gradlon Temple?
[Veyle]
Yes...
[Alear]
What's wrong, Veyle? You don't look well.
Did you need more time to rest?
[Veyle]
No, it's not that. But I... I have a request.
Please let me go in alone. I'll destroy the shard
and come right back.
[Alear]
What?! I can't let you do that. It's too
dangerous.
[Veyle]
Trust me. You won't want to face what's ahead.
It's best that you─and our friends─stay here.
Brother... Let me spare you from this.
It's best that you─and our friends─stay here.
Sister... Let me spare you from this.
[Alear]
From what? I don't understand.
[Veyle]
.
[Lumera]
Haha... Is that you, ?
[Alear]
...
[Lumera]
It is you, isn't it?
[Alear]
Mother?!
[Lumera]
Oh, my dear child. How I've longed to see
you again!
When I sensed you, I flew here as fast as my
wings would carry me.
[Alear]
It can't be. How...
[Lumera]
I've missed you so much!

[Veyle]
Don't come any closer, Divine Dragon─or
rather, Corrupted Lumera.

[Lumera]
Ah... Just when I finally had a moment with
my child.
[Veyle]
I didn't expect this. I thought she would stay
inside with the shard.
[Alear]
Veyle? Did you do this?
[Veyle]
No. It was Papa. The rings gave him the power
to create more elaborate Corrupted.
He took her body from Lythos as one last line
of defense for the shards.
[Alear]
You knew, didn't you? You knew this had
happened to Mother.
[Veyle]
I did... I also knew that we couldn't help her.
The Emblems have used their miracle. They
could revive one person, and they chose you.
There's no other way to save someone who
has been Corrupted.
[Alear]
You're saying that there's no choice. We have
to face her.
[Veyle]
You don't have to do anything, Brother.
Leave this to me.
[Veyle]
You don't have to do anything, Sister.
Leave this to me.
[Alear]
But...
[Lumera]
It's chilly out here. Why not come inside?
You want to break the shard, don't you?
Don't worry. I won't bite. I just want to have a
nice, long chat.
[Lumera]

[Alear]
Mother...
[Alear]
...


[Vander]
I can scarcely believe it... Queen Lumera,
in the flesh. What should we do?
[Alear]
We have to defeat her. There's no other way.
But...I don't know how I'll summon the strength.
[Vander]

[Alfred]
I feel conflicted myself. She was my deity.
Now I have to fight her?

[Timerra]
Yeah... Solm's people aren't super religious,
but we loved Queen Lumera too.
[Alear]
We can't falter. If we do, that's it─the world is
doomed. Let's go.
...
The door... It won't open.

[Ivy]
Let me take a look. Hmm... A spell has been
cast on it from inside.
Curious. She invited us in...
[Alfred]

[Diamant]
Wait... Where is Lady Veyle? She didn't go
inside, did she?
[Alear]
What?! No!
She can't go in there all alone... Veyle! Open
the door!

[Veyle]
Forgive me for this.

[Lumera]
Goodness. Did you come to see me all by your lonesome?
[Veyle]
Your own child shouldn't have to strike you down.
[Lumera]
How heroic of you. I'm glad we have this chance
to talk, Veyle.
From what I've heard, you are the little sister of my dear child.
If that is the case, I am practically your mother, as well.
You are welcome to call me your mother, should it
please you.
[Veyle]
Thank you for the kind offer. But I don't need a
second mother in my life. I had one.
[Lumera]
Ah! Departed, is she? Tell me...what was she like?
[Veyle]
She was kind. And affectionate. And there was so much love
within her. But she died before I could truly appreciate what I had.
She always did the best she could to keep me safe.
And she told me that if Papa ever broke free...
If he did, and if he started doing terrible things─
as his family─I had to find a way to stop him.
[Lumera]
I suppose that means you intend to murder me yet again.
[Veyle]
Yes.
[Lumera]
How I tremble at the memory of that fatal blow─the pain! Even
worse than the pain, though, how you left my heart shattered!
I was torn from the side of my beloved child!
Can you imagine the depths of my agony?
And had it not been for you, my dearest and I would
have been together for all time!
[Veyle]
I know it's my fault. The fact that you died... All of this.
Even though I was a puppet, I killed you. I stole
the rings. My actions led to this.
You can hate me all you want.
But either way...it ends here!
Ah!
[Lumera]
Oh, Veyle. Was that meant to hurt?
As I'm sure you have noticed, thanks to Lord Sombron's
largesse, I am far more powerful now than I was before.
It's a shame, really. I honestly hoped that you and
I could get along.
But anyone standing between me and my child
cannot be suffered to live.
It's ludicrous to think you might murder me for a second time.
How are you so blind? I still owe you a death for the first one.
Die, you little defect!
[Veyle]

[Veyle]



[Alear]
Veyle!

[Veyle]
Brother?!

[Veyle]
Sister?!

[Alear]
Thank goodness you're all right.
[Veyle]
The door should have been blocked. How...
[Alear]
Well, we...broke through.
[Lumera]
Haha! Oh, my child. Did you miss your mother
so badly?
[Alear]
I did. Not a day has passed that I didn't think
of you.
That's why I'm angry to see you like...this.
Hasn't Sombron ruined enough?
[Lumera]
Why do you speak ill of Lord Sombron? It was
he who brought us together again!
[Alear]
"Lord" Sombron? You are lost, aren't you?
[Lumera]
Oh, I was. During the war a thousand years ago,
I was desolate. Lonely. I had no one.
My mother, father, friends... Killed. Yet I had
to fight on, alone.
If I, the Divine Dragon, gave up or ran away,
the world would be lost.
In the midst of all that hurt, I found you.
Innocent and pure. No evil intentions of your
own. And never treated with love.
Though you were my enemy, I couldn't bring
myself to kill you. Instead, I bonded with you.
The day we first met, I stopped being alone.
[Alear]
Mother...
[Lumera]
I beg you. Don't leave me on my own─again!
Stay here with me, .
[Alear]
No. I can't do that.
The last time we spoke, you told me to fight on
with divinity.
Told me to bring peace to the world, no matter
what memories returned...
Don't you remember, Mother?
[Lumera]
Who cares what I said before? Now I want to
be together as family.
[Alear]
I understand now.
You don't think like my mother. You don't want
what she wanted.
[Lumera]
You're speaking nonsense. I'm right here.
I am your mother, !
[Alear]
No. My mother─the one I wanted to see again,
the one I loved─she's gone.
And she would want me to defeat you.
She taught me to stand strong against my every
opponent, whoever they might be.
[Lumera]
How sad your words make me. You're breaking
my heart right now...
Who poisoned you against me? The Emblems?
The stewards? That sister of yours?
I suppose I have no choice but to kill them all.
[Alear]
Prepare for battle.
[Veyle]
I'm sorry. I meant to fight this battle for you.
[Alear]
Thank you, Veyle. But this isn't your burden
to carry. It's mine.
If I don't face this myself, I can't claim to be the
Divine Dragon, an Emblem, or Mother's child.
Let's do this. Together. Then we can face
Sombron at last.
[Veyle]
Brother...
[Veyle]
Sister...

You're crying.
[Alear]
Everyone, at the ready! We will free Mother's
soul and break the final shard!

[Alear]
I'm so sorry, Mother.


[Lumera]
? That voice... Is it you, my child?
[Alear]
[Lumera]
Ngh... It would...seem that you've...received my ring at last.
[Alear]
Mother! You're yourself again!
[Lumera]
You remembered the promise that I made to you?
[Alear]
Yes! Every word you said to me before I fell asleep.
You see this? I'm one of the Emblems now.
[Lumera]
My child, an Emblem? I can hardly believe my own eyes.
Oh, how hard you must have worked to achieve such a thing.
[Alear]
It was tough, but I'm glad I can show you what I've become.
I just wanted to make you proud.
[Alear]

[Lumera]


[Alfred]
Ah! It looks like Queen Lumera is...disappearing.
[Veyle]
The Corruption is leaving her body, so now she
has to go. Nothing can be done to stop it.
[Alfred]

[Veyle]



[Alear]
I'm so sorry, Mother. It seems we have to part yet again...
[Lumera]
You're wrong... From the first moment that we connected,
I have always been at your side.
The years after I lost my family were a dark time. The pain of
what had been taken was unbearable. But then I met you.
And even though I missed you during your long
slumber, I knew that you would wake up someday.
We'd be together again.
Knowing that, how could I ever feel lonely?
You and I will...never be apart again.
[Alear]
I feel the same. Ever since we met, I've never felt
truly alone. Not really.
You showed me the warmth of a real connection,
and that is stronger than death.
[Lumera]
, you have always...been my bright, shining
light. I can never thank you enough for being my child.
[Alear]
Thank you, Mother. Getting to be your child is my
greatest happiness.
If we should meet again, I want to spend more time
with you. Pinky promise me?
[Lumera]
We will, child. I'll remember...this promise we have made.
And I'll remember you.
Aah... The sky is so beautiful above me.
Just like...the one I saw the day you opened your eyes again.
From now on...you must protect it all...
Everything...under this...beautiful sky.
[Lumera]

[Alear]
I promise.


[Veyle]
Brother, I...


[Veyle]
Sister, I...
[Alear]
I'm all right. Please don't be sad for me.
Mother is...is where she belongs now. I know we'll
meet again.
It's time to go. We have to check the barrier.



[Alear]
The barrier is vanishing. We destroyed it at last.
[Veyle]
But look what's happened to the sky...

[Marth]
Sombron opened the portal.
[Veyle]
Papa... He's there.
[Marth]
If this goes on, the power of other worlds will
pour through, and this one will be destroyed.
Elyos will meet its end.
[Alear]
No. I won't let that happen. My mother
entrusted this world to me.
I will protect everyone... Everyone who lives
beneath this sky.
[Marth]
Hm.
I have no doubt that a world ruled by you would
be a beautiful place.
[Alear]
What brought that on?
[Marth]
It needed saying.
[Alear]
I'll need you to help build that world, Marth.
Help me protect it. Forever.
[Marth]
Hm. Forever.
[Alear]
It's a promise, then.
[Marth]

[Veyle]

[Alfred]
A world ruled by the Divine Dragon
. Now that's an inspiring thought.
[Alear]
Everyone. How did our forces fare?

[Ivy]
We are treating our wounded and should be
able to leave soon.
[Alfred]

[Diamant]
You stand before the final battle, undaunted,
full of hope. I've much to learn from you.
[Ivy]


[Timerra]
When this war's over and we've had time to
rebuild, I'm gonna visit all your countries.
[Alear]
Bring the Emblems along.
After so much time confined to the rings, I'm
sure they'd like to see the world.
[Diamant]

[Alfred]
Right. Now that the 12 rings' power has been
used, people won't try to steal them.
The Emblems will be safe. They can stay
summoned and go wherever they want.
[Timerra]
[Diamant]
We'll show them our countries, introduce them
to our citizens. They'll be seen as war heroes.
[Alfred]



[Timerra]
I won't say no to a new camping buddy.
Oh, make that two! Hope they like to sing.
[Diamant]

[Ivy]
I imagine their experience will make them good
advisers for restoring Elusia.
[Timerra]

[Ivy]


[Veyle]
It's nice, isn't it? Having something to look
forward to. Something to fight for.
For the first time in my life, I'm excited for
the future.
[Alear]
Before we reach that future, we'll have to face
Sombron. Are you ready for that, Veyle?
[Veyle]
I am. I'm not afraid to stand up to him.
I was so lonely, I couldn't admit it, but...
he stopped being my father long ago.
There's no bond left to break.
[Alear]
Veyle...

[Vander]
Divine One, our wounded soldiers have been
treated, one and all.
[Alear]
Thank you, Vander.
Let's depart, everyone. The final battle is upon
us at last.
[Alear]

[Veyle]

[Vander]

[Marth]
...
This journey has made you and your allies so
much stronger.
I wish I could stay here and help you all build a
peaceful world.
But we may soon have to part ways.


--- EV ---

[Lumera]
I may no longer have the Emblem Rings, but...
" I can use the shard's power instead. Shall I
show you?


[Alear]
Mother! What are you doing?!
Everyone, get behind the pillars!


--- MOVIE ---


--- BT ---

[Lumera]
I want to be with my child. That's my only
desire. Please...stay out of this!


[Alear]
Mother!
[Lumera]
Here we are at last, ...
How about we train here? You'll be the one
fighting. The Emblem─ Ugh...

[Alear]
What? You said that back at...
[Lumera]
The Emblem lends you their... Ugh... No!
These memories...
I wanted to spend time with you. To chat for
hours, take long walks together, share meals...
And then... Then...

[Alear]
Stop, please! It's all right. There are lots of
things I wish we'd done too.
We weren't able to. But that's OK. It's better
than seeing you suffer like this.
You can still surrender, Mother. Please. For me.
[Lumera]
No. Lord Sombron gave me more time with
my child. I refuse to waste it.
I won't let anyone take that away. Not even you.
I waited for so long!
A thousand years of waiting!

[Lumera]
Relax
[Lumera]
It's been a while, Vander.


[Vander]
Queen Lumera, I cannot believe we have a
chance to speak once more.
I apologize for failing in my duty as
your protector.
And I pray you'll forgive me for defeating
you here.
[Lumera]
Relax
[Lumera]
Vander, you are my child's knight─you must fill
that role as best you can.
Attack me with all your might.

[Vander]
...
I wish we could return to that day, before
all of this.
If we could go back there, to that courtyard,
I would...
No. Even if I might take that selfish moment, my
duty stands. I must stop you here, today.
Prepare yourself, Queen Lumera!

[Clanne]
Queen Lumera. I... I...
" [Lumera]
Sharpen your focus, Clanne, lest you miss.
[Clanne]
Those words. They sound familiar.
[Lumera]
Aha, let's find out if they save your life!

[Framme]
I'm sorry, Queen Lumera. I have to do this.
" [Lumera]
That's the spirit, Framme.
[Framme]
Whoa, what? It's almost like that time when...
[Lumera]
Relax
[Lumera]
What "time?" Should I have killed you then?

[Lumera]
Here to kill me. Again. Why another attempt?
You must know the result will be the same.

[Veyle]
I still have to try. No matter how many times
I fail, I'm not going to give up.
My brother taught me I can shape the future
for the better!
My sister taught me I can shape the future
for the better!
[Lumera]
Ah, my child taught you that? How I envy you.
That memory... That time together...
Everyone, it seems, has a future. And hopes
and dreams too.
" Why should you get such treasures, while I'm
denied them?! It's not fair!
Be gone, once and for all!
Away with you!

[Lumera]
Time, it's moving too fast... I can't seem to
keep up...
