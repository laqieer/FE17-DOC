♪Fun, fun, fun for all to see! 
Gonna sing, sing, sing and go shopping!♪
[Timerra] 
♪Can't wait to see all the folks out there... 
And dance and shake my hair, hair, hair!♪
[Diamant] 
Hello, Princess Timerra. Sounds like you're 
having fun.
[Timerra] 
Hehe! What tipped you off? I'm actually headed 
into town.
[Diamant] 
All by yourself? No guards or escorts?
[Timerra] 
Yeah! Going incognito. Y'know, you're more 
than welcome to come with.
[Diamant] 
Thank you, but I'll pass. I was about to start my 
daily training regimen.
[Timerra] 
Aw! That's a shame.
[Timerra] 
♪Woulda been fun to hang with Princey D... 
But he's busy training his bo-o-dy!♪
[Diamant] 
Hmm.
[Diamant] 
I don't mean to meddle in the affairs of other 
royals, but...
[Diamant] 
If you have time to sing and dance your way 
through town, you should have time for training.
[Timerra] 
I don't see those things as mutually exclusive.
[Timerra] 
Besides, spending time with real people... 
It makes me a better princess.
[Timerra] 
Just like training makes you a better prince. 
See where I'm coming from?
[Diamant] 
I don't think I do. I train to grow stronger so I 
can better protect my people.
[Timerra] 
Then we're one and the same. I hang out with 
folks in town so I can protect them.
[Timerra] 
After all, can't keep someone safe if you don't 
know who they are.
[Diamant] 
I see...
[Diamant] 
That's an interesting perspective. I'll have to 
think that one over...while I train.

[Diamant] 
Having fun again, Princess Timerra?
[Timerra] 
Yup, tons! Let me guess─you were training?
[Diamant] 
Not today. I'd actually like to join you on your 
walk through town. I might learn a few things.
[Timerra] 
Ooo, you're going to hang out with me today? 
Sweet!
[Timerra] 
Come on, then. This looks like a perfect spot 
for us to kick things off.
[Diamant] 
Here? In this public place? What are we kicking 
off, exactly?
[Timerra] 
♪Today's the day I sing for everyone!♪
[Timerra] 
♪Come on, Prince Diamant! Now join the fun!♪
[Diamant] 
M-me?! No, I don't─ Uh, that's not what I...
[Timerra] 
♪Oh wow, would you look at that! Who knew 
the big, tough prince was a scaredy-cat?♪
[Diamant] 
I am the crown prince of Brodia. I am not a 
scaredy-cat.
[Diamant] 
Let me just, uh...
[Diamant] 
♪O Brodia, a land of strength and might. 
Evil men a-aren't allowed there...♪
[Diamant] 
♪Oh no, now everyone is staring at me. 
Princess Timerra, what do I do now...♪
[Timerra] 
♪Just keep singing, you goofball!♪

[Diamant] 
That was much, much more difficult than my 
usual combat training...
[Timerra] 
Good. So what did you think of doing things 
my way for a change?
[Diamant] 
This is how you interact with your queendom? 
And you do this all the time?
[Diamant] 
I will admit...it was nice to feel challenged. 
Like a breath of fresh air.
[Diamant] 
That said, I'm probably not cut out for your 
brand of leadership.
[Diamant] 
I feel better suited to serving through physical 
strength and combat.
[Timerra] 
Makes sense. To each their own, and all that.
[Diamant] 
Thanks for letting me join you, Princess 
Timerra. I had fun today.
[Timerra] 
I had a good time too. We've both got our 
own styles, but we make a pretty good team.

[Timerra] 
Prince Diamant. Mind if I tag along during your 
training today?
[Diamant] 
I wouldn't mind, but I'll warn you...my training 
can get pretty intense.
[Timerra] 
Hey, I can do more than just sing, you know. 
You'll see. This girl's got stamina!
[Diamant] 
Oh yeah? If that's the case, let's get started.

[Diamant] 
OK! Halfway done. Let's take a breather.
[Timerra] 
Huff... Huff...
[Timerra] 
You weren't...kidding...about this...being tough...
[Timerra] 
I talked a big game, but...I'm feeling pretty 
burnt out...
[Diamant] 
I'm amazed you've kept up this whole time! 
Most people bow out much earlier.
[Diamant] 
With that kind of stamina, imagine what a 
stricter training regimen could do for you.
[Timerra] 
Thanks, but...I'm gonna keep doing things 
my way, if it's all the same to you.
[Timerra] 
Whew. OK.
[Timerra] 
Hey, between you and me...do you think peace 
is really possible?
[Diamant] 
Ah. That's a big question...and one I often worry 
about myself.
[Diamant] 
Ultimately, as leaders, I think it's our duty to 
believe that peace is possible.
[Diamant] 
If we won't fight to secure that kind of future 
for our people, who will?
[Timerra] 
You're right. The future is uncertain, but that's 
all the more reason for us to try.
[Timerra] 
I gotta say, talking with you has given me hope 
that good things lie ahead.
[Diamant] 
I'm glad. We're both heirs to our respective 
thrones. If you ever need to talk, I'm here.
[Timerra] 
Thanks. I really appreciate that.
[Diamant] 
All right, break's over. Time to resume training. 
Think you can keep going?
[Timerra] 
You know what? I just had a great idea!
[Timerra] 
How about we sing the rest of the way?! 
Could be a fun challenge.
[Diamant] 
Ha! Sounds fun. But, uh...you go first.
