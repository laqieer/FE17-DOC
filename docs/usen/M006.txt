=== Chapter 6 The Stolen Ring ===

(Mountain Settlement)
Having regained Firene Castle, the
party heads to a shrine housing
the Ring of the Dawn Maiden.

--- OP ---



[Alfred]
Almost there. Just a little farther north and we'll
be at the shrine.
[Alear]
The landscape's gotten rockier.
[Alfred]
We're near Brodia. It's all mountains up there.
[Alear]
I'm seeing fewer villages as well. Makes this a
good place to hide an Emblem Ring, I suppose.
[Alfred]
Yeah. The closer you are to the Brodian border,
the colder and quieter it gets.
Look. Not a soul in sight.
[Alear]
You're right. There's no one around...
Except her.
[Alfred]
Oh!
[Alear]
[Alfred]
" [Yunaka]
Take a little look around... Wait for it...
[Yunaka]

[Alfred]
I wonder what she's doing here.
[Alear]
[Alfred]
[Yunaka]
Ugh... Ugh...
[Yunaka]


[Alear]
She's crying.
[Alfred]
Well, doesn't that break the heart?
I'd better help. I am her prince, after all. I won't
stand by when my people are suffering.
[Alfred]

[Alear]
Alfred, wait!
[Alear]

[Yunaka]
Oh, what a scrape I'm in...
[Alfred]
Hey there!
[Yunaka]
Huh?
[Alfred]
What's the matter? Something I can help with?
[Yunaka]
...
Zuh... Zuh...


[Alear]
I knew we'd startle you. Sorry for popping up
out of nowhere and─
[Yunaka]
Zappy! You came just in time! I'm saved!
[Alear]
Uh...
[Yunaka]
I lost something earlier and there was nobody
around to help, so I got real stressed out.
[Yunaka]
Oh, right, I skipped over the niceties. You can
call me Yunaka. Hiya papaya!
[Alear]
Hiya...papaya?
[Alfred]
Huh! I've never heard that one before.
Anyway, what did you lose, Yunaka?
[Yunaka]
It's a little round ring. Kind of shiny with a hole
in the middle?
Oh, and it talks, for some reason.
[Alear]
Come again?
[Yunaka]
Yeah, I figured you wouldn't believe me.
[Alear]
I believe you. It might be an Emblem Ring.
[Alfred]
Please, go on. What did it say?
[Yunaka]
Hm... If I remember right, it asked me to take it
to the Divine Dragon.
[Alear]
To me?
[Yunaka]
Is that─ Did you─ Are you saying you're the
Divine Dragon?
[Alear]
Yes, I am. I'm sorry I didn't mention it sooner.
I'm the Divine Dragon .
[Alfred]
And now that we're doing introductions,
I'm Alfred, the prince of Firene.
[Yunaka]
Holy brocc-oly! Why didn't you lead with that?!
I think I just had a heart attack... Nope, false
alarm. Whew.
[Alfred]
I'm so sorry. I never meant to impact
your health.
[Alear]
Yunaka, how did you find the ring?
[Yunaka]
I was walking along the border, minding my
own business, when I heard a woman's voice.
"Help me... I'm right here... I'm by your foot."
[Alear]
Huh. You're quite the performer.
[Yunaka]
Anyway, I picked up the ring and she said,
"Take me to the Divine Dragon."
But at that point, I had no idea where the Divine
Dragon was! So I told her I couldn't help.
She knew the way, though. Told me to start
heading for the capital of Firene.
[Alfred]
That's good advice. The quickest way to get to
Lythos is through the capital.
[Yunaka]
But on the way, I was attacked by bandits and
ran off full speed...and now the ring's gone.
I must have dropped it somewhere! Woe is me!
Sniffle, sniffle.
But now that you're here, you're gonna help me
find it! Right? Right?
[Alear]
After hearing her story, this definitely sounds
like an Emblem Ring.
Probably the Ring of the Dawn Maiden. But that
means someone took it from the shrine.
[Alfred]
Or it could be another Emblem Ring. We'll just
have to find it and see for ourselves.
[Alear]
All right, Yunaka. We'll help you.
[Yunaka]
Golly, that's great news! She'll be so happy if
you're the one who finds her!
[Alear]
Let's start by retracing your steps.




[Alear]
No sign of the ring so far...
[Yunaka]
Maybe somebody got to it before we did.
[Alfred]
Yeah, everyone's combing the area. If it was
lying around, we would have found it by now.
[Alear]
You're sure you didn't lose it before the
bandits attacked?
[Yunaka]
I had it on me when I passed through that
ghost town over there...
Huh?!
[Alear]
What is it?
[Yunaka]
It looks like the town's overrun with bandits.
[Alear]
What? How can you tell?
[Yunaka]
I'll bet these are the same chumps who
ambushed me earlier.
[Alear]
Let's take a closer look.



[Alfred]
They've taken over the town.
[Yunaka]
These are the bandits I ran into earlier, no doubt
about it.
And that means one of them's got...
Aha. Right there.
[Alear]
You see it?
[Yunaka]
Yeah. A burly guy with something glinting in
his hand. That's got to be our missing ring.
[Alfred]
What do you think, Divine One? Is it an
Emblem Ring?
[Alear]
Hmm... He's too far. I really can't say.
You must have great eyesight, Yunaka.
[Yunaka]
Yeah, I have a killer's eyes.
[Alear]
What was that?
[Yunaka]
Killer eyes! I've got killer eyes! You know,
they're great at seeing stuff!
If you ever need something looked at real good,
I'm your gal! Hehehe...
Anyway! What's the plan? Now we've got two
problems that need solving.
[Alear]
A stolen ring, and a town full of bandits.
[Alfred]
The ring's our first priority, but we can't leave
them unchecked.
[Yunaka]
We'll only attract attention if we all charge in
at once. I say we split up.
You know, send in a small group to recover
the ring. Nice and stealthy.
[Alear]
All right.
[Yunaka]
OK, then! C'mon, Divine One, you're with me!


--- ED ---




[Alear]
That's the last of the bandits. You've been a
huge help, Yunaka.
If not for you, we'd be scratching our heads in
an empty shrine right about now.
I can't thank you enough.
[Yunaka]
It was nothing, really...
[Alfred]
I wonder who took it from the shrine in the
first place.
[Alear]
It must have been those bandits, right?
[Yunaka]
Uh... Well...
[Alear]
What's the matter?
[Yunaka]
I have a...uh...confession. The thing is...
I didn't find the ring. I stole it.
[Alear]
Huh?
[Yunaka]
I was strapped for money, and when I saw the
shrine, I figured it might have valuables.
I went inside, heard Micaiah's voice, and pow,
there's the ring staring right at me.
I was just looking to make a quick bundle
of dough! I'm sorry.
[Alear]
I see.
[Yunaka]
When I learned that you two were royalty,
I panicked and kinda, well...lied.
Really, I'm no different from those bandits.
I'll accept whatever punishment you give me.
[Alfred]
Hold on. You were planning to sell the ring?
[Yunaka]
Yeah...
[Alfred]
Well then, why didn't you?
You could have run for the hills as soon as the
Divine Dragon handed it to you.
We're useless in the dark. Would've been easy
to give us the slip.
But instead, you stuck around and risked your
neck for us. Why?
[Yunaka]
Well...because of Micaiah.
When she started talking to me, I got this
feeling that I just couldn't shake.
I felt like...like I had to help her get to the
Divine Dragon.
[Micaiah]
Yunaka has shown me nothing but kindness.
Fighting by her side, I saw a bright path ahead.
When I sensed Sombron's return, I called out in
the dark. It was she who answered.
I am to blame for entangling her in all this.
Yunaka has done nothing wrong.
[Micaiah]
[Alfred]
I hear you. But she did lie to us.
As prince, I'm not supposed to let that go
without some sort of punishment.
[Yunaka]
Lay it on me. I can handle it.
[Alear]
How about...joining our forces?
[Yunaka]
Say what now?
[Alear]
We're on a journey to collect the Emblem Rings
and defeat the Fell Dragon.
I know it's a lot to ask, but... Will you pledge
yourself to our cause?
What do you think, Alfred? A fitting
punishment?
[Alfred]
I love it. Our army is pretty lean, so adding a
new recruit makes a lot of sense.
And Yunaka clearly has raw talent. She could
be a real asset.
[Yunaka]
I won't let you down.
Thank you. Both of you.
[Alear]
Don't mention it. And, Yunaka, allow me to be
the first to say... Hiya papaya.
[Yunaka]
Uhh... Hehehe!
Hiya papaya back atcha, Divine One!
[Alear]
With that settled, let's hurry onward. We've
got to cross into Brodia, right?
[Alfred]
Yes. Mother sent a letter to the Brodian king
when we left the castle.
He should be expecting us.
[Alear]
Good. The kingdom of might... I'm curious to
see what it's like there.



[Alear]
Huh? Is that...
Hey!


[Veyle]
Hm?
[Alear]
You're the girl I met in Florra Mill Town!
Veyle, wasn't it?
[Veyle]
Oh! What a coincidence finding you
here, .
[Alear]
I'm glad to see you again. You left so abruptly
last time─it really caught me off guard.
Do you live around here?
[Veyle]
No. I'm just passing through. Well, looking for
someone, really.
[Alear]
Who are you looking for?
[Veyle]
A person I must talk to again, no matter what.
My sibling.
[Alear]
You were separated, then... I'm sorry. It's
painful to be apart from one's family.
Do you have any idea where to look?
[Veyle]
None. I don't even know what face to look for.
We've been apart since I was very young.
But they did give me something long ago─this.
[Alear]
What a pretty stone.
[Veyle]
It's my good-luck charm. I know that as long as
I have this, we'll be reunited someday.
[Alear]
I'm sure you will.
But don't forget to take care of yourself.
Look─your leg's wounded.
[Veyle]
This kind of thing happens all the time.
[Alear]
It looks pretty deep... There, that ought to hold
for a while.
[Veyle]
Thank you. You're quite kind to help a complete
stranger like me.
[Alear]
You're not a stranger. You saved my
life, remember?
That makes us friends, as far as I'm concerned.
And friends help each other.
[Veyle]
Friends...
...
[Alear]
Should I not have said that?
[Veyle]
No, no. I'm just so happy to have someone I can
call a friend. It's like a dream.
I can't recall the last time I was treated with
such kindness.
[Alear]
What do you mean by that?
[Veyle]
I'm sorry, but I have to go.
[Alear]
Are you sure?
[Veyle]
Thank you for the bandage. Hope to see you
again, .
[Veyle]

[Alear]
There she goes.
See you around, Veyle.

Yunaka, let me show you how to use staves.

[Micaiah]
Relax
[Micaiah]
With my magic, you may illuminate even the
darkest of places.

[Yunaka]
Looks like our cover's blown. They're snuffing
the torches.
Don't sweat it. We can relight them as we go.

[Yunaka]
Okey dokes. If we go through here, I bet we can
sneak up on that guy with the ring.

[Alear]
Slipping through a side passage. Smart
thinking, Yunaka.

[Yunaka]
There he is! Let's take him by surprise!

[Alear]
Good idea.

Oh, dear. You can't even hear me, can you?

[Yunaka]
I hear her! That's the voice from before!

[Alear]
That's definitely an Emblem Ring. Yunaka, will
you help me get it back?
[Yunaka]
Of course, you weirdo! That's why we're here.
[Alear]
Right. Well, thank you. You know...
Now that I hear her, your impression was
incredibly accurate.
[Yunaka]
Hehe, stop! You're gonna make me blush!


[Alear]
It's pitch black out here.
How can we fight them if we can't even
see them?
[Yunaka]
Don't worry, Divine One! That's what I'm
here for!

[Yunaka]
My eyesight's so sharp I can spot baddies even
when it's dark or foggy.
[Yunaka]
Relax
Till you get your hands on a torch, at least.
Then you'll see as well as I can.

We got the ring! Heal us, Emblem of Dawn!

Yunaka, I entrust this ring to you.

Me?! But I...

[Alear]
She belongs with you. All I ask is that in return,
you help us defeat these bandits.
Will you join with Emblem Micaiah?
[Yunaka]
Yeah, OK! I won't let you down!

Looks like we got us some uninvited guests.
