=== Alear & Yunaka ===

[Alear]
Impressive work out there today, Yunaka.
[Yunaka]
Whoa, what? I got praise from the Divine One?!
Zappy! I'm thrilled! Beyond thrilled!
[Alear]
I'm serious. Skills like yours are in high demand.
You must have been a mercenary or something.
[Yunaka]
Right, um...mercenary! Yeah! You could tell?
I mean...
[Yunaka]
Obviously I've merc'd a time or two.
No big deal.
[Alear]
I thought so. With strength like yours, you must
be pretty well-known too.
[Yunaka]
Uh, sure?! I mean, yup! People, ah...
People know me.
[Alear]
I'll bet some of our allies are well acquainted
with your reputation already.
[Alear]
I'll have to ask around. There must be stories.
[Yunaka]
Aah! No! I mean... Could I ask you to maybe...
not do that?
[Alear]
What? Why?
[Yunaka]
Because I lied. Again.
[Yunaka]
I've never been a mercenary. You said it, and it
sounded nice, so I went with it... I'm sorry.
[Alear]
I'm confused.
[Yunaka]
You asked me about my past. I panicked.
And just like always, I hid behind a lie.
[Yunaka]
I'm truly sorry, Divine One. I should not have
deceived you.
[Yunaka]
You were only trying to praise me, and I just
had to go and ruin it.
[Yunaka]
I'll take my leave.
[Alear]
Yunaka...

[Yunaka]
What can this humble liar do for you,
Divine One?
[Alear]
I'd like to have a talk, that's all.
[Yunaka]
I understand. And I'm prepared to accept
whatever punishment you have in mind.
[Alear]
Punishment? No. I wanted you to know how
grateful I've been to have you by my side.
[Yunaka]
Wait, what?
[Alear]
That's how I feel.
[Alear]
You fight hard every day to protect our allies.
There's absolutely no reason to punish you.
[Alear]
In hindsight, I think the only reason you lied is
that we don't know each other very well yet.
[Alear]
So, let's change that. Why don't you start by
telling me something about yourself, Yunaka?
[Yunaka]
Heh... Way to put me on the spot.
[Alear]
If you don't want to, then I won't pry.
Simple as that.
[Yunaka]
OK...
[Yunaka]
Before I joined up with you, I was sort of just...
wandering. Looking for my place in the world.
[Yunaka]
I'd left my old self behind me. Wanted to think
I had, at least.
[Alear]
You don't sound very fond of your old self.
[Yunaka]
Oh, I like her well enough. Others, though,
not so much. That's why she had to go.
[Yunaka]
But I like who I am now, and honestly, I've
been having so much fun since we met!
[Alear]
Haha, I'm glad to hear that.
[Alear]
Good talk, Yunaka. I think we should do it again
sometime. What do you say?
[Yunaka]
You got yourself a deal.

[Alear]
What would you like to talk about
today, Yunaka?
[Yunaka]
This isn't easy for me, but I want you to know
why I've had a hard time telling the truth.
[Yunaka]
So I'm just going to lay it all out there, OK?
The truth is, I...
[Yunaka]
The truth is, I... I used to be...
[Alear]
It's all right. You don't have to tell me.
[Yunaka]
But I...
[Alear]
I can see how hard this is for you. It's obvious
just looking at your face.
[Alear]
I told you before that I won't pry. It really is as
simple as that.
[Yunaka]
You're really OK with me keeping a secret from
you like this?
[Alear]
Of course. I have secrets too, you know. There's
no need to make yourself uncomfortable.
[Alear]
I only want to hear what you are ready to
tell me.
[Yunaka]
Thank you. Sincerely.
[Yunaka]
What I'm ready to say is that I'm truly grateful
to have a friend like you in my life.
[Yunaka]
I feel like I've finally found that place in the
world I was looking for, you know?
[Yunaka]
That's entirely thanks to you, and I won't forget
it. I'm glad to fight for you and all our friends.
[Alear]
I really appreciate that, Yunaka.
[Yunaka]
I'll tell you all I can about my past, but I think
the present is what matters. Us, here and now.
[Yunaka]
We're just getting to know each other. There's
so much more to say! It's like an adventure.
[Alear]
An adventure. I like that. I look forward to
continuing this journey with you, Yunaka.

[Yunaka]
OK, Divine One. It's time for me to come clean.
[Yunaka]
I know you said you wouldn't pry, and you only
want to hear what I'm ready to say.
[Yunaka]
But I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna get, and
you have a right to know.
[Alear]
If you're sure this is what you want, I'm here
to listen.
[Yunaka]
OK... Here goes.
[Yunaka]
My name used to be Larimar. I changed it to get
away from my old life...as an assassin.
[Alear]
Go on.
[Yunaka]
I was never too attached to Larimar...or to her
parents, who left her when she was young.
[Yunaka]
She is my past, though. In that sense,
she'll always be a part of me.
[Yunaka]
Which means, even though I've moved on, you
can't know the real me without her.
[Alear]
It was brave of you to tell me all that.
[Alear]
I do want to know the real you. The value of
this conversation is not lost on me.
[Yunaka]
I appreciate that. Thank you, Divine One.
[Alear]
Of course.
[Alear]
Since you trusted me with your secret, Yunaka,
I guess I'd better tell you mine.
[Yunaka]
I didn't even know you had one.
[Alear]
When you told me how glad you were to fight
alongside me, I wanted to jump for joy.
[Yunaka]
Why?
[Alear]
Because somewhere along the way, I stopped
being able to imagine my life without you in it.
[Alear]
There's no one more important to me than you.
I want you by my side, always.
[Alear]
So I guess that's my secret.
[Yunaka]
Divine One...
[Alear]
If you'll accept it, I'd like you to have the
Pact Ring.
[Yunaka]
But that ring is precious to you...
[Alear]
You're precious to me, which is why I want
you to have it.
[Alear]
Whether we're talking about your past self, your
current self, whateverâ”€I cherish all of you.
[Yunaka]
You're amazing!
[Yunaka]
I want to know everything about you. I want
to accept all of you like you've accepted me.
[Yunaka]
No more lies, no more secrets. I want to be with
you the rest of my life. That's how I truly feel.
[Alear]
I feel the same way. Let's be true to each other,
from now on, as partners.
[Yunaka]
Happily, .
[Yunaka]
A new chapter starts today. I cannot wait to see
what our future holds.
