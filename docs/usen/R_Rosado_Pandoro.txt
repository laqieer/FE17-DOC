=== Rosado & Pandreo ===

[Pandreo]
AR-AROOO! What'd you think of the
party, Rosado?
[Rosado]
AR-AR-AROOO! Incredible! If it's always this
fun, I wanna do it every day!
[Pandreo]
Every day, huh? Even to me, that sounds...
kinda exhausting.
[Pandreo]
I guess it's different for you. You're from the
village of the fair folk.
[Rosado]
Sure am!
[Pandreo]
I hear people there can go all night long and not
even have shadows under their eyes.
[Pandreo]
I've even heard you can eat and drink to your
heart's content without getting full.
[Pandreo]
Gotta tell ya, I'm jealous. I wish I could do that.
[Rosado]
I'm relieved you're only jealous about it.
[Pandreo]
Huh? What do you mean?
[Rosado]
Some folks think it's a bit...creepy, actually.
[Pandreo]
Pfft! How ridiculous.
[Pandreo]
Don't pay any mind to them. They're just too
proud to admit that they're as jealous as me.
[Rosado]
Yeah, I know. Thanks.
[Pandreo]
Right on. Well, I'll come knocking next time
there's a party! You best be ready! AROOO!
[Rosado]
AROOO!

[Pandreo]
...
[Rosado]
You seem a little glum, Pandreo! Had a little
too much fun partying?
[Pandreo]
Yeah... No. I wish that was the only thing
bothering me.
[Rosado]
What's the matter? I'm happy to listen if it'll
help at all.
[Pandreo]
Well, it's not the first time it's happened, and it
won't be the last.
[Pandreo]
See, some uptight clerics have sent my church
a formal complaint.
[Rosado]
Ah, right. Your church is a little unusual, isn't it?
[Rosado]
I've heard you make the whole thing accessible
with lavish parties and adorable fashions.
[Pandreo]
And putting up big signs with directions to
the church.
[Pandreo]
Apparently to serious people, tactics like that
are "unbefitting the dignity of the church."
[Pandreo]
I mean, come on! We're pulling in more and
more new followers every day!
[Pandreo]
They're so focused on the bad that they can't
see the good. It's infuriating.
[Rosado]
Yeah, that must be frustrating!
[Pandreo]
Thanks for letting me blow off steam.
[Pandreo]
Just another day or two in the doldrums and
I'll be my peppy self again.
[Rosado]
I'm sure you will, Pandreo.

[Rosado]
Hey, Pandreo! Take a look at this.
[Pandreo]
Huh?
[Rosado]
It's a landscape I drew of your church.
[Pandreo]
Whoa! You made this just for me? Why?
[Rosado]
Something I wanted you to see! Lookâ”€this lady.
She was really there.
[Pandreo]
She looks so happy.
[Rosado]
Yeah! I captured her face exactly as you see it.
She was overjoyed to be at your church.
[Pandreo]
I see... So I really am helping people.
[Pandreo]
That's what I've been working toward. Giving
people some joy in their lives.
[Rosado]
And you've been doing a fantastic job!
[Rosado]
Before, you said folks get so focused on the
bad that they can't see the good.
[Rosado]
I think that's kind of true of you too, Pandreo.
[Pandreo]
I... Huh? What do you mean?
[Rosado]
You've been looking so hard at the bad that
you're completely missing the good.
[Pandreo]
Hm!
[Pandreo]
You know what? You're exactly right.
[Pandreo]
Thanks, Rosado! That makes me feel a whole
lot better.
[Pandreo]
From now on, no more doubting myself!
I'm gonna keep my spirits high!
[Rosado]
Then let's bring the party back tonight! AROO!
[Pandreo]
Oh, I am SO in! AROOO!
