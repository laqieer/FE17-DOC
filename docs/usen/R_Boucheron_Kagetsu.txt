[Kagetsu] 
You are Boucheron of Firene, are you not? 
You appear quite formidable.
[Kagetsu] 
That is why I, Kagetsu of Elusia, challenge you 
to pit your abilities against mine!
[Boucheron] 
You have an eye for skill, I see. Challenge 
accepted.
[Kagetsu] 
Excellent! Now, let our weapons speak for us!
[Kagetsu] 
Ha! Hyah!
[Boucheron] 
Hahaha, fancy! Needs more oomph, though!
[Kagetsu] 
Phew! Magnificent duel! But let us be done 
for today.
[Kagetsu] 
I must say, that was thrilling! You did 
not disappoint.
[Kagetsu] 
Your physique gives you power, but you are 
equally light on your feet in defense.
[Boucheron] 
You weren't bad yourself. I haven't seen moves 
like yours before. They're tough to block.
[Kagetsu] 
Have you not? That must be because I learned 
them in my homeland.
[Boucheron] 
You're not from Elusia?
[Kagetsu] 
Not originally. My home and its unique culture 
are far away from here.
[Boucheron] 
Do tell. That's very interesting.
[Kagetsu] 
If you wish to know more, you must duel me 
again! I do not part with secrets for nothing.
[Boucheron] 
Heh, all right. Count me in.
[Kagetsu] 
Good then! I look forward to our next contest.
[Boucheron] 
I'll be practicing.

[Kagetsu] 
Forgive me for making you wait. I mean no 
disrespect to our close bond of friendship.
[Boucheron] 
"Close bond"? We've sparred one time.
[Kagetsu] 
There is no greater bond than that of shared 
experience in battle!
[Boucheron] 
Is that how it works where you're from?
[Kagetsu] 
Of course! It is only natural. Is it different 
where you are from?
[Boucheron] 
Hm, somewhat.
[Kagetsu] 
Then how do you express bonds of friendship 
in your lands? Would you like to quiz me?
[Boucheron] 
Quiz you? On what subject?
[Kagetsu] 
No, no. Quiz. When two people press their 
mouths together.
[Kagetsu] 
Come, give me a quiz!
[Boucheron] 
A "quiz" when two people press their 
mouths together...
[Boucheron] 
Oh! Do you mean a kiss?
[Kagetsu] 
Yes, yes! That. Come, give me one of those.
[Boucheron] 
I'm afraid not. Kissing is for bonds of romantic 
love, not friendship.
[Kagetsu] 
Is that so? Cultures of other countries are so 
foreign to me.
[Kagetsu] 
Well, enough jokes. Let us begin our sparring!
[Boucheron] 
You were...joking?
[Kagetsu] 
Certainly! Everyone knows that friends do not 
quiz each other.
[Boucheron] 
Don't toy with me.
[Kagetsu] 
Haha, if you are angry, show it as we fight!
[Boucheron] 
All right, then. If you want the full Boucheron, 
then that's what I'll give you.
[Kagetsu] 
Ah, there is your war face! Now, come at me!

[Kagetsu] 
Extremely satisfying! Today's sparring was 
excellent as usual.
[Boucheron] 
Agreed. A few rounds with you is much better 
than my normal training.
[Kagetsu] 
Agreed. Yes.
[Kagetsu] 
You know... I feel strong bonds of friendship 
between us, whether you do as well or not.
[Kagetsu] 
Even if you do not want to be friends, I am filled 
with joy merely to be your sparring partner.
[Boucheron] 
Oh, but that's not the case. I want to have a 
strong bond with you too.
[Boucheron] 
So...
[Kagetsu] 
So?
[Boucheron] 
When will you tell me about your homeland?
[Boucheron] 
Where I'm from, people usually bond by talking 
about their lives with each other.
[Kagetsu] 
Hm. Then I shall do exactly that.
[Kagetsu] 
My home has something we call "wa." People 
are calm, wise. The fish and rice are delicious.
[Boucheron] 
Ah... What's your family like?
[Kagetsu] 
My royal father has great swordsmanship. 
My priestess mother has mysterious powers.
[Boucheron] 
Mmm... You must have inherited your skills from 
your father.
[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps...
[Boucheron] 
Do you see your family often?
[Kagetsu] 
No. I abandoned them with my homeland.
[Kagetsu] 
To put it simply, I was unable to resist my 
desire to see the world at large.
[Boucheron] 
Do you ever miss them?
[Kagetsu] 
Of course. But I cannot go back as I am. I must 
return only when I have...grown.
[Kagetsu] 
I must earn glory and honors here so they will 
understand why I left. So they will not be angry.
[Boucheron] 
...
[Kagetsu] 
What is it? Why are you crying?
[Boucheron] 
It struck me while we were sparring...
[Boucheron] 
For someone who seems so carefree, you must 
be carrying a heavy burden.
[Kagetsu] 
No, stop it. You are going to make me cry 
as well.
[Kagetsu] 
If we cry together, you will have to quiz me! 
Take responsibility and quiz me on my lips!
[Boucheron] 
Huh?
[Kagetsu] 
Kiss! Where I am from, when you weep together 
with someone, you must kiss afterward! Hurry!
[Boucheron] 
What?!
[Kagetsu] 
Haha, only joking, my friend! We are playing 
around like two dear old pals!
[Boucheron] 
Ah, hahaha! You've got to quit messing with 
me like that.
[Kagetsu] 
Shall we spar some more? If you defeat me, 
I will tell you more of my home and past.
[Boucheron] 
Sounds good. And if I yield, I'll tell you 
something about myself.
[Kagetsu] 
Exciting! Let us begin!
