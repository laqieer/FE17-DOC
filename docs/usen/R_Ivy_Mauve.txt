[Ivy] 
Excuse me, Mauvier?
[Mauvier] 
Princess Ivy? How may I help?
[Ivy] 
I was hoping we could speak.
[Ivy] 
We find ourselves in similar circumstances.
[Mauvier] 
Similar circumstances? Oh, I think I understand.
[Mauvier] 
We have each stood as enemies before those we 
now call our allies.
[Ivy] 
Exactly.
[Ivy] 
In light of that, Mauvier, do you feel this is 
where you truly belong now?
[Mauvier] 
I...am unsure.
[Mauvier] 
There are those who accept me, but I do not 
believe everyone does yet.
[Mauvier] 
I feel comfortable here, but that means nothing.
[Mauvier] 
I am behaving as if all is well, yet I do so 
lacking any evidence that it is so.
[Ivy] 
Yes.
[Mauvier] 
Still, I have no intentions of leaving.
[Mauvier] 
I have dedicated myself to helping others, and 
with that, I hope to find acceptance.
[Mauvier] 
And a new place for myself in this world.
[Ivy] 
I understand entirely.
[Ivy] 
For whatever it's worth, let me say that 
I accept and welcome you as a friend.
[Ivy] 
Speaking as someone who would also benefit 
from hearing those same words from our allies.
[Mauvier] 
Thank you for your candor, Princess Ivy.

[Mauvier] 
Is it true?
[Mauvier] 
Princess Ivy, you worship the Divine Dragon? 
But all of Elusia worships the Fell Dragon.
[Ivy] 
It is true.
[Ivy] 
Every worshipper of the Fell Dragon that I knew 
was a poisonous liar and schemer.
[Ivy] 
So I chose to rebel and instead prayed to the 
Divine Dragon. In private, of course.
[Mauvier] 
You had a considerable amount of courage for 
a young princess.
[Ivy] 
Thinking back on it, perhaps I did...
[Ivy] 
You are also from Elusia, are you not? 
Do you worship the Fell Dragon?
[Mauvier] 
I was born in Firene.
[Mauvier] 
When I was young, my father fell ill and died. 
Afterward, my mother and I traveled to Elusia.
[Mauvier] 
Mother's prayers to the Divine Dragon hadn't 
saved Father. We changed deities as a result.
[Ivy] 
Ah.
[Ivy] 
And how is your mother now?
[Mauvier] 
My mother died soon after we began our 
new lives.
[Mauvier] 
I was raised in a church in Elusia, alongside 
the other orphans.
[Ivy] 
I didn't realize. I'm so sorry.
[Mauvier] 
I have nothing to hide.
[Mauvier] 
I was educated by Fell Dragon believers, but I 
cannot say I was ever truly devoted.
[Mauvier] 
As with my mother, I found that my deity was 
not interested in me or my desires for peace.
[Ivy] 
I see.
[Ivy] 
So you were surrounded by the Fell Dragon's 
followers, yet you chose not to follow.
[Mauvier] 
I have rarely admitted such to anyone else, but, 
yes, I suppose we are similar in that way.
[Ivy] 
Hmm, quite. I wonder what else we might have 
in common.

[Mauvier] 
It is strange...
[Mauvier] 
I always end up telling you about my past. That 
is something I do not normally do with people.
[Ivy] 
It's the same with me. For some reason, I find 
myself spilling all my secrets to you.
[Mauvier] 
Well then, this creates a problem for us both.
[Ivy] 
Agreed.
[Ivy] 
I fear that the closer we become, the more 
likely I am to reveal a weakness.
[Mauvier] 
Or could it be we are both hoping for such an 
accident to happen to the other?
[Ivy] 
We are quite similar indeed.
[Mauvier] 
Princess Ivy. You may remember...
[Mauvier] 
I strive to be accepted as an allyâ”€by everyone. 
That is my goal, and it drives every decision.
[Ivy] 
I remember.
[Mauvier] 
I may have been wrong in that way of thinking.
[Ivy] 
What do you mean?
[Mauvier] 
If I were accepted by one person, I would be 
happy. Other opinions would be meaningless.
[Mauvier] 
With that one person's acceptance, I would be 
in the place I belong.
[Mauvier] 
So if you are willing to accept me, then...
[Mauvier] 
I would know that this is where I belong.
[Ivy] 
That's a lovely way to think of it.
[Ivy] 
Let us fight, then, to protect a place where 
we belong. Together.
[Mauvier] 
Yes.
[Ivy] 
And shall we continue spilling our dearest 
secrets to one another?
[Mauvier] 
Whatever secrets you spill, I shall be there to 
clean them up, Princess Ivy.
