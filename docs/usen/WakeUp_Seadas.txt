Waking the Divine Dragon...a strange 
task indeed.


Sleeping soundly. This may prove challenging.
I'll do a bit of dancing while I wait.
Step...jump...turn...
Ah, yes. Nearly perfect.


Ah, good morning.
Did my footwork wake you?
Well, perhaps...
when the moon returns...
I'll dance for you.


Ah, you're already up, it seems.
I'll save my wake-up services for another time.

I read your fortune.
It says two paths await you today. But which 
one shall it be?


Ah, you sleep deeply. Your card is Le PÃ©gase.
The Pegasus.
Good fortune awaits...
if you wear something blue.
So the card says.


Good morning.
As I was saying...
you may encounter someone special to you.
Oh, no.
I would never suggest it would be me. I will 
take my leave.


Ah, you woke quickly. Your card is Le Cheval.
The War Horse.
It means a busy day awaits...
and you should wear yellow.


--- B1 ---

Yes, this place...it's perfect for dancing.


I'm sure many dancers performed for you here.
If only you could have seen my master dance.
He was beauty in motion.


Divine One, I could dance for you.
Here, tonight. If you'd like.
I could perform my master's dance.
And share its profound beauty.


Ah, did I wake you?
I'm sorry. I was just looking for somewhere 
to practice.
This altar...
Surely it was made with dance rituals in mind.

Spirit of the cards, moon and stars above...
please, tell me, would a midnight snack provide 
proper fuel for my dance?!


You see, I must be vigilant about the food 
that fuels me.
It seems silly, but...
I eat perfect food so I can dance perfectly.
Though, a snack of honey and butter does 
sound perfect right now.


I'm sorry.
It's so late and yet here I am.
I thought perhaps...
you'd have words of wisdom for me...
as you often do.


Ah, forgive me, Divine One.
My fortune telling was loud, wasn't it?
It's so quiet here. I should've been more careful.
I'll...leave.

Divine One, you should see the sky tonight. 
It's breathtaking.
Come, let's read the stars together.


Or are you lost in dreams?
I wonder...what do you dream about.
I often dream about the desert's moonlit sky.
Hah, even in my dreams, all I do is gaze at 
the stars.


Good evening.
Now, make a wish.
It may come true.
Did you know, saying a wish out loud pulls it 
toward you?
You see? A shooting star just sailed by.


Ah, you're taking me up on my offer.
The view of the stars from the altar... 
It defies words...
and pulls one's thoughts...
far, far away.


--- A2 ---

Today I dance with a full stomach and, 
more importantly, a full soul.


My breakfast was quite savory.
A joyful fuel indeed.
Thank you, Divine One.
You've helped me change.


You're awake, are you?
Can you sense how happy I am? Can you see 
the beauty inside?
What I hope you see...
is a better me.


Ah, good morning.
What do you say...
we start the day with a dance?
Please, Divine One...
share this joy with me.


--- S1 ---

Divine One, it's me. I'm here to wake you.
But I can study my cards until you decide to 
join me.


Ah, I've drawn Le Destin, the card of fate.
There can be no doubt...
Destiny brought the two of us together.
The stars aligned...
the very moment I first saw you in the fortress.
And you, Divine One...
You have woven our fates together ever since.
I beg you, never let them come undone.


At last. I was starting to worry you wouldn't 
wake up.
Please, be careful out there today, and 
every day.
I can't have you join the stars in the sky 
without me.


Ah, good morning. I'm not surprised you 
woke so quickly.
No. I did not see it in my cards.
Some things are obvious...
when you know someone as well as I know you.


--- S2 ---

The Pact Ring... I had this feeling it was guiding 
me here.
Perhaps I imagined it?


This world is shrouded in many mysteries.
Was it you who guided me here somehow? 
And if so, for what reason?
Perhaps it was so I'd dance for you once again.
I'll dance for you just like I did the day you gave 
me the ring.
And it'll remind you that I am yours, 
now and always.
My heart, my dancing, my everything... Every bit 
of it is yours, Divine One.


Ah...
Now that you're up, it's time for breakfast.
I know.
Let's fuel our day with savory dishes while we 
savor our time...
together.


Or perhaps it was you.
Did you want to see me?
I hope so.
I hope you want to see me as much as I want 
to see you.
