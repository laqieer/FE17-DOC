[Pandreo] 
Lady Veyle, can I have a moment?
[Veyle] 
Yes, of course.
[Pandreo] 
As a man of the church, I worship the 
Divine Dragon.
[Pandreo] 
So I was wondering... Can I pray to you too?
[Veyle] 
Oh, um...
[Veyle] 
I don't think that's a good idea.
[Pandreo] 
Why not? You're a dragon, aren't you?
[Pandreo] 
Dragons are sacred creatures. It's natural for 
humans to worship them.
[Veyle] 
Yes, I understand. But I'm not a Divine Dragon. 
I'm a Fell Dragon.
[Veyle] 
As a cleric who worships the Divine Dragon, 
wouldn't it be...wrong for you to worship me?
[Pandreo] 
Divine Dragon, Fell Dragon... A distinction 
without a difference.
[Veyle] 
But you must know what I've done.
[Veyle] 
Your fellow worshippers would turn on you 
if you started praying to someone like me.
[Pandreo] 
No. Solm is an open-minded queendom.
[Pandreo] 
When they see me praying to you, others will 
follow suit. Just you watch.
[Veyle] 
Oh, I─ I don't think that's a good idea.
[Pandreo] 
You're overthinking it. Trust me on this.
[Veyle] 
But...what if you're wrong?

[Veyle] 
Um, Pandreo?
[Pandreo] 
Hey, is something the matter?
[Veyle] 
I don't understand. How did I end up with all 
this food?
[Pandreo] 
Let's see...vegetables, wheat, meat, fish. 
That's quite a haul you've got.
[Veyle] 
There's so much, I don't even know what to 
do with it all!
[Veyle] 
Why is everyone sending me these gifts?
[Pandreo] 
They're not gifts exactly. They're offerings. 
People's way of expressing their faith in you.
[Veyle] 
I understand that the people who live in the 
queendom of Solm are quite free-spirited...
[Veyle] 
But why are you...why is everyone...being so 
kind to me?
[Veyle] 
It's just...it doesn't make sense.
[Pandreo] 
Well, as angry and vengeful as humans can be, 
they can also be compassionate, forgiving.
[Pandreo] 
Many people, in Solm and beyond, recognize 
that you've changed for the better.
[Pandreo] 
I'm sure if they met you in person, they would 
show you nothing but kindness.
[Veyle] 
They would? Really?
[Veyle] 
If that's how it is, I suppose I'd like to give 
something back to everyone.
[Veyle] 
They've given me the gift of happiness, and 
I want to repay them.
[Pandreo] 
I like it. What did you have in mind?

[Pandreo] 
AROOO! Who's ready to get their howl on?!
[Veyle] 
Awoo...
[Pandreo] 
Louder, Lady Veyle!
[Veyle] 
I─ I'm a bit embarrassed.
[Pandreo] 
This party was your idea! You wanted to give 
something back, remember?
[Pandreo] 
If you want folks to let loose, you've got to lead 
by example.
[Veyle] 
Yes, you're right.
[Veyle] 
I wanted to show everyone how grateful I am, 
and you made this party happen. So here goes...
[Veyle] 
Awoo! Thank you so much for coming 
everyone!
[Veyle] 
You gave me gifts─and the gift of happiness! 
In return, I hope you enjoy this celebration!

[Veyle] 
...
[Pandreo] 
Looks like folks are clearing out. Time for us to 
clean up.
[Veyle] 
I had...so much...fun.
[Pandreo] 
Hm?
[Veyle] 
The party...it was amazing.
[Veyle] 
Everyone was so nice to me, and you wouldn't 
believe all the good conversations I had.
[Veyle] 
I felt like I was dreaming.
[Pandreo] 
I told you, didn't I? They know that 
you've changed.
[Veyle] 
I wonder if some people still distrust me. 
You know, deep down.
[Veyle] 
But at least they got to know the new me 
a little bit. The real me.
[Veyle] 
Pandreo, I don't want this day to end.
[Pandreo] 
No need to worry. We can have another bash.
[Veyle] 
Oh good!
[Pandreo] 
Though of course, we wouldn't want people to 
think you don't take the war seriously.
[Pandreo] 
I suggest holding off on any more parties until 
the world is at peace.
[Veyle] 
Of course. You're right.
[Pandreo] 
Meanwhile, you can depend on me. You're 
easily one of my favorite dragons, after all.
[Veyle] 
Thank you, Pandreo, for everything 
you've done.
[Veyle] 
I will do my best to bring peace to our world. 
That would truly be something to celebrate.
