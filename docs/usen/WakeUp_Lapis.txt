Guh, I'm so nervous about this...


So this is a sacred altar, huh?
Wow. Everything in here looks so expensive...
Such luxury! I could just die...


Good morning! Phew.
I'll just, uh, get out of here...


Ah! You're awake!
Now I'm just intruding on sacred ground!

Sleep is the best... You're not hungry while 
you sleep.


No pillows? This doesn't look very comfy...
I think I'd manage, but...
I should make something soft.


Ah! Sorry!
I came to wake you, but I'm gabbing 
about pillows...
Good morning, I guess!


Good morning?
It was my job to wake you today.
So...I'll be going now!

Oh no! I got here early!


I'll craft something while I wait.
Let's connect these bits of wood...
Set the stone, hammer it in, dab of paint...


Morning!
I made you an alarm clock, Divine One.
Set a time, and it'll explode into bits of─
Huh? You don't want it?


Sorry, I'm early...
You can go back to sleep, OK?


--- B2 ---

Ngh... I wish liquids weren't so...ugh, awkward 
to carry!


I'm glad we did that training together.
You liked your pack too...
Hmm... What should I make for you next?


Morning! Care for some milk diluted with water?
The milk lasts longer, and it still tastes 
pretty good!


Good morning!
Care for some milk diluted with water?

Time to wake up.


If I close my eyes halfway...
all of this fancy decorating might intimidate me 
a bit less...
Wait... Augh! This won't work! Now I'm just 
nervous that I'll knock something over!


Morning, Divine One.
This room always gets to me.
I have to get over this feeling...


A nice, quick wake-up.
Good thing. Now I can leave this fancy room a 
bit sooner.

Haah... Haah... I can't believe I lost track of time 
digging up Brodian yams!


It wasn't even the yams.
It was all that edible wild grass!
I just couldn't stop picking the stuff!


Sorry, Divine One! I'm a little late.
Huh?! This─ This grass?
It's, uh, for crafting!


Oh! You're up!
I'll cook up a yam feast to apologize for 
being late, OK?

It's me, Divine One.
I'm not nervous this time.


I wore the Pact Ring.
It gets dirty when I work...
and I'm scared to lose it in battle...
I never know when to wear it, but...
If I don't wear it in here, with you...
when would I ever, y'know?


Morning. Could we, uh...
Could we linger here for just a minute?
I treasure these quiet moments...
They're so rare.


Morning! Glad you got up fast...
It is fun to wake you, though.
For your sake, I'd have kept trying.

Your most trusted partner is here! Hehe!


I brought some minerals with me!
Which color do you like?
I kind of like this peach-colored one.
I can inlay a stone...
and make a new ring for you!
I want this to be my best work. Then it will fully 
capture how I feel.


You're up!
See how pretty these are?
One wasn't enough. I needed all of them...
to really show how much you mean to me.


Did you hear that?
I just wanted to try the phrase on for size!
I will admit, putting it into words makes me kind 
of embarrassed...
