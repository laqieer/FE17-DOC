[Lapis] 
You know what, Rosado? You're quite cute. 
I've always thought so.
[Rosado] 
Aw, I'm so flattered! Thank you!
[Lapis] 
The fact that you're so consistently adorable... 
Well, I admire that. What's your secret?
[Rosado] 
Hmm... Not sure I've got one.
[Rosado] 
I guess I just try to be my best self. I think about 
who I am inside, and...I bring it out.
[Lapis] 
Yeah?
[Rosado] 
Sure. Appearances matter, but true beauty 
is what's inside.
[Rosado] 
Even the most fashionable ensemble is useless 
if you don't feel it. You've gotta believe in you.
[Lapis] 
Hm... So that's why I'm not cute. There's 
something wrong with what's inside me.
[Rosado] 
What? Lapis, you're gorgeous.
[Lapis] 
No! I'm not confident at all. Really, there's a lot 
that I'm self-conscious about.
[Lapis] 
Like the fact that I eat grass and shrubs, or that 
I'm so dang strong...
[Rosado] 
I didn't catch all that, but I can tell by your 
face it's serious. This really matters to you.
[Rosado] 
Whatever it is, why don't we talk it over? 
I'll gladly lend you an ear.
[Lapis] 
Really? How kind! I appreciate that.
[Rosado] 
And I appreciate you. Come find me anytime.

[Lapis] 
Hey, Rosado. Can I ask you something? It's 
about what we discussed the other day.
[Rosado] 
Sure, sure!
[Lapis] 
You said the secret to cuteness is confidence. 
Well...how did you find your confidence?
[Rosado] 
Hmm, I dunno. I think it must have come from 
how I was raised.
[Lapis] 
I see.
[Rosado] 
I was born in a village near the Lake of Mystery. 
Some people call it the village of the fair folk.
[Rosado] 
It's a place of wonder. Beauty beyond the silly 
expectations that come with stuff like gender.
[Lapis] 
Wow! I've never heard of such a place.
[Rosado] 
Everyone accepts everyone there. However you 
see and present yourself, you're beautiful.
[Rosado] 
That was my normal, growing up. It was a big 
shock when I left─seeing how different I was!
[Rosado] 
But I realized I love being different. And I want 
everyone to know being different is amazing.
[Lapis] 
You're saying being different...is good?
[Rosado] 
Not just good─amazing! Your differences are 
what make you unique. What make you...you!
[Rosado] 
In a way, being apart from my home village has 
made me even more confident in who I am.
[Lapis] 
Huh... So your uniqueness became a source of 
confidence. I like that.
[Rosado] 
Me too! And if it helps you at all, that makes me 
even happier.
[Lapis] 
Thanks. Everything you've said has resonated 
with me. Let's chat again soon, all right?
[Rosado] 
Of course! Anytime!

[Lapis] 
Rosado, I want to thank you for sharing with me 
the other day. The truth is...I'm different too.
[Rosado] 
Tell me all about it! I wanna know everything 
unique about you.
[Lapis] 
Well... My family is, um...poor. Very poor. 
It's always made me feel like an outsider.
[Lapis] 
Just being poor would be one thing. But I also 
like wild plant life, and I'm scary strong.
[Lapis] 
I end up kind of...fixating on my weirdnesses. 
That makes it hard to feel confident.
[Rosado] 
None of this sounds bad to me! You know tons 
about plants, you're super strong... That's great!
[Lapis] 
When you put it that way, they almost do sound 
like positives, but...
[Rosado] 
Still hard to talk about sometimes though, 
isn't it?
[Lapis] 
Yeah.
[Rosado] 
If it'll help...I'll give you an embarrassing truth 
of my own. I've always admired you, Lapis.
[Lapis] 
Wait a second... You? Admired me?
[Rosado] 
Yup. Even from the time we were enemies, 
back at the Grand Crossing.
[Rosado] 
You were swinging that huge sword around. 
You were so powerful. So stylish!
[Rosado] 
I remember thinking how jealous I was. How I 
could never do something like that.
[Lapis] 
R-really?
[Rosado] 
Really. How did you get so strong, anyway? 
Is it all from your training?
[Lapis] 
No. It's because I fought off a lot of bears back 
in my hometown.
[Rosado] 
Bears! Well, I guess we can say your strength 
goes all the way back to where you came from.
[Lapis] 
Yeah... Yeah! I guess you're right!
[Lapis] 
Thank you, Rosado. Hearing you say all that, 
I'm feeling much more confident.
[Lapis] 
One day I'll be able to say with pride, "I am who 
I am because of my hometown!"
[Lapis] 
Maybe not, uh...anytime soon. But someday.
[Rosado] 
I think that's a wonderful goal.
[Rosado] 
When the time comes, you can announce it 
with a flourish of that huge sword!
[Lapis] 
Of course. I'll get an even bigger sword, so you 
can't possibly miss it.
