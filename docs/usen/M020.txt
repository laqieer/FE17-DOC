=== Chapter 20 The Kingless Castle ===

(Elusia Castle)
After recovering two rings from 
Marni and Mauvier, the party 
reaches Elusia Castle at last.

[Zephia] 1 
[Marni] 2 

[Griss] 3 
[Mauvier] 4 
[Zephia] 
What?
You let them take two of our rings?
[Mauvier] 
I apologize.
[Marni] 
See, we...we figured if we stole a couple rings, 
you'd be proud of us...
[Griss] 
There's no point stealing theirs if we keep 
losing ours, you morons!
[Marni] 
I'm sorry, OK?
But Lord Sombron will understand. We're his 
favorites, after all.
He's not gonna scold us for losing a 
couple rings.
[Zephia] 
Marni.
[Marni] 
Yes?
OW! Aw, that hurt!
[Zephia] 
You should have done as I ordered─no more 
and no less. I cannot protect you this time.
[Marni] 
Me? It's your fault we lost the Ring of the 
Holy Knight!
[Zephia] 
I was following Lady Veyle's orders. Do you 
mean to suggest she is at fault?
[Marni] 
Well... No, but...
[Mauvier] 
I will not make excuses. If punishment is due, 
give it to me.
[Zephia] 
You?
[Mauvier] 
Marni was merely seeking your praise. I am 
to blame. I should have stopped her.
[Zephia] 
What a selfless display. To see you show care 
for a fellow Hound... I'm touched.
Or perhaps you fear what I'll do to Lady Veyle 
if I'm angry.
[Mauvier] 
...
[Zephia] 
Alas, it's too late. I've already cast the spell.
[Mauvier] 
What?! You promised to wait until our return!
[Zephia] 
I meant to, I really did. But then the defect 
awoke. I had no choice.
And don't speak to me of promises. You have 
broken your vow to Lord Sombron.
As the head of this family, I must punish my 
children when they misbehave.
[Marni] 
Punish? What are you gonna do?
[Mauvier] 
Marni, run!
[Zephia] 
I don't think so.
[Marni] 
AAAH!
[Mauvier] 
Argh!
[Marni] 
[Mauvier] 
[Griss] 

[Griss] 2 
[Griss] 
Look at that. Both out cold. Seemed painful too.
[Zephia] 
Stop your salivating. You have work to do, 
and I'm leaving.
[Griss] 
What should I do with them?
[Zephia] 
Oh, they'll come crawling back. They have 
nowhere to be but at my side.
I trust you won't be distracted from the task 
I gave you.
Even as they inflict pain upon you, pay 
attention. There mustn't be the slightest doubt.
[Griss] 
I know. I've got to see if that loser is Lord 
Sombron's kid.

[Alear] 1 
[Ivy] 2 

[Ivy] 
Here we are. Elusia Castle.
[Alear] 
Sombron is likely within those walls. Veyle too.
[Ivy] 
Yes.
[Alear] 
I hope she's safe. But there's a chance she'll 
face us as an enemy, not a friend.
Be vigilant. At the first sign of danger, we 
should retreat...
...
[Ivy] 
[Alfred] 2 
[Alfred] 
What's wrong?
[Alear] 
Those words─they're Marth's.
That's what he told me at Destinea Cathedral, 
before...before I lost him.
We still haven't recovered from our defeat 
that day. What if it happens again?
[Alfred] 
It won't. We're stronger than ever before.
You've really stepped into your role of divinity.
[Alear] 
You really think so?
[Alfred] 
Yes. That's why I know we'll get the 
Emblems back.
[Alear] 
That's the highest praise you could give me.
Let's go.

[Alear] 1 
[Ivy] 2 

[Alear] 
Is Elusia Castle usually this quiet?
[Ivy] 
No. I would at least expect royal soldiers to be 
standing guard.
[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
Maybe Sombron...dealt with them.
[Timerra] 4 

[Timerra] 
You mean, turned them into the Corrupted?
[Alear] 
No...
[Alear] 

[Ivy] 
[Diamant] 

[Timerra] 

[Griss] 1 
[Griss] 
Who needs those boring soldiers when you 
can have me?
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Griss.
[Griss] 
Been a while, Divine One! Welcome. You must 
be tired after that long journey.
Oh, and look, the long-lost princess! 
Got homesick, huh?
[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
...
[Griss] 
I gotta hand it to you─two more rings in your 
pocket. Not bad.
But for the complete set, you'll need more. 
Like...this one.
[Alear] 
The Ring of the Caring Princess!
[Griss] 
It's the real deal too. I'll prove it.
[Celica] 3 
[Celica] 
...
[Ivy] 
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
Celica!
[Griss] 
I'll give her back. All you gotta do is beat me.
[Alear] 
What is this?
[Griss] 
Nothing. What, you think Lord Sombron's 
gonna show up?
[Alear] 
It's one against many. We'll crush you.
[Griss] 
Mmm, you know just what to say.
Relax. No one's coming. If I'm wrong, I'll bite off 
my tongue and choke on my blood.
[Alear] 
What is this about?
[Griss] 
You want answers, you'll have to whack 'em 
outta me.
[Alear] 
Fine. I don't know what you're after, but we 
won't let this chance pass us by.
Get ready, Griss. We'll make you give back 
that ring.
[Griss] 
Now you're talking. Make me, dragon!
Tear me limb, from limb, from limb...

[Alear] 2 

[Griss] 1 

[Alear] 
The ring! We got it back!
[Griss] 
Hehehe...
[Alear] 
What are you laughing at?
[Griss] 
Me? Nothing.
Better summon her. Want to free her from 
Lord Sombron's power, don't you?
[Alear] 
I know.
Care for us, Emblem of Echoes!
[Griss] 
...

Default 
[Alear] 2 
[Celica] 1 
[Celica] 
I thank you, !
[Alear] 
Emblem Celica, it's such a relief to have you back again.
[Celica] 

[Griss] 1 
[Griss] 
Haha... Ahahahaha!
[Alear] 
...
[Griss] 
Hahaha... Oh man. Ain't this whole thing just 
a laugh-riot?
Zephia, that little hunch of yours was so dead on!
[Alear] 
I think it's clear you've lost your mind.
[Griss] 
Look at you, acting all high and mighty.
[Griss] 
"It's clear you've lost your mind." Yeah, that's cute.
The real question is, have you lost yours? 
You're playing up this whole thing like you're a god. 
But you're fighting on the wrong side.
Why're you staring at me with that stupid look on 
your face?
You think you're a Divine Dragon? Lemme set 
ya straight.
You are the child of the Fell Dragon!
[Alear] 
I am his child? No, but... How?

[Griss] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Vander] 4 

[Vander] 
How dare you utter such slander! Such lies!
[Griss] 
If the dragon doesn't remember it, how the hell 
would you know anything?
Were you there a thousand years ago? Hmm?
[Vander] 
...
[Griss] 
I'll tell you how I figured it out. Divine and 
Fell Dragons can both summon Emblems, right?
But they don't do it the same way. Divine 
Dragons pray. Fell Dragons, though...
They use invocations.
[Alear] 
...
[Griss] 
That's how you summoned Celica. That's how 
you've done it all along, isn't it?
Which means you're─say it with me─the 
Fell Dragon's child.
[Alear] 
But then... I don't understand. Why did Mother 
call me her child?
[Griss] 
How should I know? You'll have to ask her. 
Oh, wait.
[Vander] 
You blackguard!
[Griss] 
Hahaha! Sticks and stones, buddy. Anyway, 
now I've got what I came for.
Too bad it cost me a ring. But I was told to buy 
time, and I did.
Lord Sombron and Lady Veyle should be 
long gone by now.
[Alear] 
You mean...they were here after all.
[Griss] 
Whoops. Didn't mean for that to slip out.
Ah, well. Your Divine Dragon's a fraud. 
Take your time falling apart.
Will you scatter to the winds? Cut each other's 
throats? So many options!
See ya.
[Griss] 

[Vander] 
Halt!
[Vander] 

[Alear] 
I'm... I'm the Fell Dragon's...
[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
He was lying, Divine One. I don't believe a 
word of it.
[Ivy] 3 

[Ivy] 
We can't be divided by the enemy. We must 
be calm.
[Alfred] 
[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
Saying Sombron isn't here may have been 
another attempt to mislead us.
[Ivy] 

[Timerra] 3 

[Timerra] 
Let's look around and make sure.

[Ivy] 4 
[Diamant] 3 

[Timerra] 1 

[Timerra] 
Well?
[Diamant] 
This place is well and truly deserted.
[Ivy] 
Yes. Sombron is no longer in the castle.
[Timerra] 
[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
What should we do now?
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
...
If what Griss said is true, I should leave.
[Ivy] 
[Diamant] 
[Alfred] 
What do you mean, "leave"?
[Alear] 
The night Mother died, I had a nightmare where 
I was surrounded by flames.
My hair and eyes were red. Now I see...it wasn't 
a nightmare. It was a memory.
[Alfred] 
One bad dream doesn't prove anything.
[Alear] 
Maybe not. But this will.
Emblem Sigurd.
[Sigurd] 4 

[Sigurd] 
I am here.
[Alear] 
You knew me a thousand years ago, didn't you? 
Answer this.
Was Griss telling the truth? Am I the Fell 
Dragon's child?
[Sigurd] 
...
You are.
[Alfred] 
...
[Vander] 3 

[Vander] 
How can this be?
[Alear] 
So it's true.
[Sigurd] 
I apologize. With your memories lost, we 
thought you could be happy living this way.
That is what Lumera and I agreed upon the day 
you awoke.
[Alear] 
Why did Mother call me her child?
[Sigurd] 
Sombron had turned his back on you. Your life 
was in danger...
Both you and Lumera wished, above all else, 
to be a family.
That is the fullness of my knowledge.
[Alear] 
That's plenty, Sigurd. Thank you.
I'm sorry, everyone. I'm not a Divine Dragon. 
I never was.
[Vander] 
You have nothing to apologize for.
[Alear] 
Only a Divine Dragon could imprison Sombron 
as Mother did.
What chance do we have now of surviving 
this war?
Without such power, there's no hope of 
stopping Sombron.
[Vander] 
[Alfred] 

[Sigurd] 
[Sigurd] 1 

[Sigurd] 
Why would you assume you lack the power of a 
Divine Dragon?
[Alear] 
...
[Sigurd] 
You have Fell Dragon blood, yes... But you 
forget your own abilities.
Think back to Florra Port, when my ring was 
returned and you summoned me.
[Alear] 
But I used an invocation.
[Sigurd] 
Emblems summoned through a Fell Dragon's 
power cannot communicate.
[Alear] 
...
[Sigurd] 
Think back upon Emblems summoned with the 
Fell Dragon's power. Could they speak?
[Alear] 
No... When I called out to them, they 
didn't answer.
[Vander] 4 

[Vander] 
Please explain further, Sir Sigurd.
[Sigurd] 
A Fell Dragon's invocation robs an Emblem of 
their free will. Their service is compulsory.
With a prayer, the Emblem keeps their free will. 
A Divine Dragon would wish nothing less.
You use both invocation and prayer.
[Alear] 
You mean...I do have the power of a 
Divine Dragon.
[Sigurd] 
Precisely.
Your hair and eyes prove the fact eloquently. 
At one time, both were red...
The blue is proof that, through Lumera's love, 
you have inherited a Divine Dragon's power.
Lumera shortened her life so that you could 
succeed her as the Divine Dragon.
[Alear] 
Mother...
[Sigurd] 
We Emblems fight alongside you of our 
own volition.
We could only deepen our bonds with you 
because you have the power of a Divine Dragon.
You are the one intended to carry on 
Lumera's legacy.
Will you still leave, after hearing this? 
Is that your wish, ?
[Alear] 
No.
I want to stay.
I can't change that I'm the Fell Dragon's child. 
I know that.
But I would like to continue on as the Divine 
Dragon...if you will have me.
[Sigurd] 

[Vander] 
[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
Of course we will!
[Alear] 
Oh, Alfred...
[Alfred] 
Sure, first we came to you because we needed 
your help. But now I care about you.
Fell or Divine or whatever else, we need you. 
So no more talk about leaving us.
[Alfred] 
[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
We'd never have made it this far without you. 
I will follow wherever you lead.
If you have only half of your power, so be it. 
We'll make up for the other half.
[Diamant] 

[Timerra] 1 

[Timerra] 
What matters to me isn't how you were born. 
It's what you do with the life you're given.
If you choose to live as a Divine Dragon, then 
that's what you are!
[Timerra] 
[Ivy] 1 

[Ivy] 
Conflicted as I might be, I am made resolute by 
the terror I feel at losing you.
Because, to me, you are the Divine Dragon. 
Your leaving would not change that bond.
[Ivy] 
[Sigurd] 1 

[Sigurd] 
Everyone agrees. After all, you are what 
connects them.
You are, and always shall be...the 
Divine Dragon, .
[Alear] 
Thank you, everyone.
There's much I don't know. I may have made 
choices in the past that I can't take back.
But for now, I'll continue on this journey 
with you.
[Sigurd] 
We Emblems will follow you. Completely of our 
own free will.

[Mauvier] 1 
[Alear] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Divine Dragon.
[Alear] 
Mauvier, it's you.
[Mauvier] 
I overheard your conversation about being 
Lord Sombron's child.
If that is true, then I urge you to help 
Lady Veyle.
[Alear] 
What? You're not here to stop us?
[Mauvier] 
All this time, Lady Veyle has been sustained by 
a desire to meet her sibling.
If she sees you, she will be saved. I know it.
[Alear] 
I'd like to support her like my friends here have 
supported me.
Veyle─the true Veyle─has been a friend to us. 
But we don't know where she is.
[Mauvier] 
She is traveling with Lord Sombron to the 
land of Lythos.
[Alear] 
Lythos? But why?!
[Mauvier] 
You will have to trust me. I can explain on 
the way.
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
What do you think?
[Alear] 
Let's go with him.

He vanished! Griss must be using Emblem 
Celica's power.

He's probably hiding in the shadows. 
Be careful, everyone.

Fine, I'll give you the ring. As soon as I've 
gotten my fill!
