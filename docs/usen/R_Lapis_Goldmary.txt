[Goldmary]
Oh no... What am I going to do?
[Lapis]
What's wrong?
[Goldmary]
Well... My parents run an inn beside the finest
hot springs in Elusia.
[Goldmary]
I'm sorry if that makes you jealous. I can't help
that I grew up an only child in the lap of luxury.
[Lapis]
Uh, wow! Sounds lovely!
[Goldmary]
Yes, but...my parents have just informed me
that the inn is having trouble with bears.
[Lapis]
Bears, huh? Ugh, they can be tricky to
deal with.
[Lapis]
There's no time to lose. We'd better write up a
letter telling your parents what to do.
[Goldmary]
But I don't know anything about bears.
[Goldmary]
I have so many talents, but dealing with
terrifying predators isn't one of them...
[Lapis]
Leave it to me. I'm from a village where we deal
with them all the time, so I know my stuff.
[Goldmary]
Really?
[Lapis]
Here's an example. Let's say you find a bear
eating your crops.
[Lapis]
So you say, "HEY! Get outta here, fur face, or
you're in for a world of hurt!"
[Lapis]
The bear will be like, "Oh, sure thing," and have
lunch elsewhere.
[Goldmary]
Wow...
[Lapis]
Seriously! I'm speaking from experience here.
I've done it dozens of times.
[Goldmary]
All right, you're the expert. I trust you.
[Lapis]
I know lots of bear-management methods, from
intimidation to good old-fashioned combat.
[Goldmary]
Please teach me everything you know.

[Goldmary]
Thank you so much for all your help, Lapis.
[Goldmary]
My parents wrote to let me know that the bears
have stopped giving them trouble.
[Lapis]
That's great! What a relief.
[Goldmary]
They sent this along to thank you.
[Lapis]
Huh? Wait a second. Is this...
[Goldmary]
An invitation to relax and enjoy your stay at my
family's inn─as soon as the war is over.
[Goldmary]
I may be biased, but I really do think you'll find
our hot springs to be the finest in the world.
[Lapis]
Wow, that sounds like such a treat! Thanks!
[Lapis]
I have to say, Goldmary, I'm surprised you're
from a little village. You're so sophisticated.
[Goldmary]
Oh, don't be silly. You're right, though. Go on.
[Lapis]
Let me guess. You were born in a rural area
and then raised in the big city?
[Goldmary]
No, I lived in my home village until just a few
years ago.
[Goldmary]
I was there right until I had to leave for the
academy, actually.
[Lapis]
Huh. Your village must be way different
than mine.
[Goldmary]
I'd be curious to hear about the differences.
[Lapis]
Sure thing. Next time we talk, I'll tell you all
about where I grew up.
[Lapis]
I'll even make us lunch! I know just the thing to
whip up for the occasion.
[Goldmary]
Wonderful! Usually I'm the one making the food,
so this will be a nice change of pace.
[Goldmary]
I'm looking forward to spending more time
with you.

[Lapis]
Hello, Goldmary! I made lunch. Hope you
brought an appetite.
[Goldmary]
Mmm, these look delicious. What are they?
[Lapis]
They're yam dumplings, made with yams from
my village. Go on─eat up!
[Goldmary]
I've never heard of them before. I hope they
taste as good as they look.
[Goldmary]
Mmm... My goodness!
[Goldmary]
They're wonderful! I didn't expect them to be
so intensely sweet.
[Lapis]
That's all from the yams. I didn't use sugar.
[Goldmary]
I hope you don't mind if I help myself to
the rest.
[Lapis]
By all means! I'm sure my parents would be
glad you're enjoying their yams so much.
[Goldmary]
Are they farmers?
[Lapis]
Mm-hmm. The land is infertile, though, so
they're pretty poor.
[Lapis]
And bears are always roaming around, so we'd
have to hunt them down and eat them.
[Goldmary]
That explains how you came to know so much
about handling that bear situation.
[Lapis]
I learned a lot from dealing with those bears.
Above all, I learned how to fight.
[Lapis]
Then I entered Brodia's fighting tourney─my
ticket out of poverty.
[Lapis]
By winning the tourney, I earned a spot as
Prince Alcryst's retainer.
[Lapis]
So you might say I have bears to thank for
my success.
[Lapis]
No one in the tourney held a candle to them,
after all!
[Goldmary]
Hehe, they do set a high bar.
[Lapis]
And now, you might say I have those bears to
thank for my friendship with you.
[Goldmary]
You're right. And I'm very glad for that.
[Goldmary]
I don't often let my guard down around people,
but...I feel like I can be myself around you.
[Goldmary]
If it's all right, I'd like it if we could spend time
together more often.
[Lapis]
I'd love that!
[Goldmary]
Great! You and I can chat about all the aspects
of village life the big city folks can't understand.
[Lapis]
Hehe, sounds like a plan!
[Lapis]
It's nice to have a friend from the country─
even if it's a different country's country.
