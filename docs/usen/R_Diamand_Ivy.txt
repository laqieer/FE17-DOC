=== Diamant & Ivy ===
--- C ---



[Ivy]
Is someone there?
[Ivy]
No one? Or...a ghost?
[Ivy]
Please don't be a ghost. Please don't be
a ghost.

[Diamant]
Princess Ivy?
[Ivy]
Aaah!
[Diamant]
It's OK. You're safe─I promise. Those shadows
in the brush are just that, simple shadows.
[Ivy]
I was...actually jumping at shadows?
[Ivy]
You're right. Not a ghost to be seen.
[Diamant]
It isn't like you to misread foliage as an active
threat. Is everything OK?
[Ivy]
...
[Ivy]
Please don't tell anyone about this.
[Ivy]
It cannot get out that the future ruler of Elusia
was frightened by mere shrubbery.
[Ivy]
Or even worse, that the prince of Brodia had to
come to her rescue.
[Diamant]
Believe me─I understand. I won't say a word.
[Ivy]
I am in your debt.
[Diamant]
It seems you've been dealing with this fear for
a while...
[Diamant]
Here, Princess Ivy. I'd like for you to have this.
[Ivy]
What is it? Some kind of...crystal?
[Diamant]
It's a gem from one of Brodia's mines. It's said
to bring courage to those who need it.
[Diamant]
Keep it as a good-luck charm. Then you won't
have anything to be afraid of.
[Ivy]
Charity from Brodia is not going to do
my royal image any favors...
[Diamant]
Don't think of it as a tether to Brodia. This is
just a simple gift from me to you.
[Ivy]
...
[Diamant]
If it truly makes you uncomfortable, you don't
have to keep it. I won't mind. Farewell.
[Diamant]

[Ivy]
Thank you, Prince Diamant.
[Ivy]
I didn't know such treasures could be found
in Brodia.

[Ivy]
Prince Diamant, I wanted to apologize
for earlier.
[Diamant]
What do you mean?
[Ivy]
I failed to thank you properly─both for your
discretion and for the gem you gave me.
[Ivy]
Please let me make amends by expressing
my gratitude now.
[Ivy]
Thank you.
[Diamant]
Oh, please don't worry about that.
[Diamant]
Brodia has a lot to answer for. Offering a token
like that gem is the least I can do.
[Ivy]
It's true. Brodia has invaded our lands
many times.
[Ivy]
I often wonder how my people would have fared
without that suffering and bloodshed.
[Diamant]
I'm not surprised. That's why you don't owe me
any gratitude. I hope you understand.
[Ivy]
But you stepped in to help me, one person to
another, in accordance with your values.
[Diamant]
Hm.
[Ivy]
That is why, in accordance with my values,
I want to thank you.
[Diamant]
I see.
[Diamant]
If that's how you truly feel, Princess Ivy, then
I accept your gratitude.
[Ivy]
It's all too easy for one individual to give
a simple thank-you to another.
[Ivy]
Apologies are much the same. It is when
kingdoms are involved that it gets complicated.
[Diamant]
That's true.
[Diamant]
My father was focused on our kingdom's affairs
when he began expanding our territory by force.
[Diamant]
That singular focus is how things have always
been done in Brodia...but that needs to change.
[Ivy]
What do you mean?
[Diamant]
My father is no longer here, but his influence
remains. Change will take time.
[Diamant]
If there's an easier way, I haven't found it yet.
I often wonder if I'm ready to be king.
[Ivy]
I know exactly how you feel.
[Diamant]
Ah. I apologize. I didn't mean to unload like that.
[Ivy]
No, I understand. I'm actually relieved to hear
that you have the same concerns I do.
[Ivy]
I am much more hopeful now for that future
when you and I are king and queen.

[Ivy]
Prince Diamant, I have something to show you.
[Diamant]
Is the gem in this necklace the one I gave you?
[Ivy]
Yes. I decided to make it into something I can
wear every day.
[Diamant]
Well done. It's quite stunning.
[Ivy]
We don't have materials like this in Elusia, but
we do have skill in craftsmanship.
[Ivy]
Perhaps this is a symbol of the way forward for
us─Brodian resourcefulness, Elusian talent.
[Ivy]
A path to peace and prosperity based on
respect for one another's gifts.
[Diamant]
I see...
[Ivy]
This gift, the gem, really has made me braver.
[Ivy]
Where else could I have gotten the courage to
reimagine our entire relationship?
[Diamant]
Thank you, Princess Ivy...and I say that as a
crown prince of Brodia this time.
[Ivy]
Oh...
[Diamant]
Convincing Brodia to change its warmongering
ways will be a battle of its own.
[Diamant]
War leads to profits, which lead to wars, which
lead to further profits... It's a horrible cycle.
[Diamant]
That cycle cannot continue. And I'm the only
one who can stop it.
[Diamant]
This necklace is a perfect symbol of our shared
goal. Both of our kingdoms intertwined...
[Diamant]
So thank you. I promise you here and now that,
under my rule, Brodia will champion peace.
[Ivy]
Thank you, Prince Diamant.
[Ivy]
I will take your words to heart and share them
with my people.
[Ivy]
With the two of us as role models, our kingdoms
can stop fighting. We can open trade relations.
[Ivy]
Elusia's craftspeople will certainly benefit from
access to Brodia's resources.
[Diamant]
If that leads to more goods like this necklace,
both kingdoms will prosper.
[Diamant]
It's a good plan.
[Ivy]
Now we just need to bring it to fruition.
[Diamant]
And we will. We'll make sure of that.
[Diamant]
Let's shake on it as leaders and friends. A new
era of peace begins right here.
[Ivy]
Gladly. Let this be the dawn of a new day
between us.
