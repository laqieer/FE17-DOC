Hello, Divine One! Is this not a 
beautiful morning?


I can't believe you're still sleeping. And after all 
that noise I made!
All my family members are so easy to wake up. 
Uh, what am I supposed to do now?


Ah! Divine One!
Now that you're up...
whaddaya say we grab breakfast?


You're up!
How 'bout some breakfast?
I could go for some nice, sweet tropical fruit.


--- C2 ---

Divine One! Divine One! 
Oh, you're asleep!


I wrote this letter...
but how do I mail it from here?
In Solm, I'd just send it by carrier flamingo.


You're up!
So hey...
Got any flamingos around here?
I need to send a letter to the Sentinels.


That's more like it!
Aww, look at that sleepy face.
Well, I'm glad you're up!


--- B1 ---

OK, no more nice Prince Fogado. Time to 
get you outta bed!


Here, smell this yummy food... Still not getting 
up, eh?
How about some music to rouse you? Nothing!
What if I blow in your ear?
*gentle blowing*


Mornin'!
Didn't like that, huh?
Well, it worked!
You know what they say...
Can't argue with success.


Up so soon?!
But I was about to get rowdy with my 
wake-up service.
Go back to sleep.
Let me try. Please?!


--- B2 ---

Ciao, Divine One. Sorry to disturb you.


I'm kinda glad you're asleep.
It's just, when I told you how I pretend to be 
easy-going...
Well, thanks for listening.
You see, because of that, I...


Morning!
Aw, never mind.
I was just going to say that, uh...
I'm gonna work harder than ever.
All for you, Divine One.


Oh, you're awake?
I, uh, wanted to talk about something...
It's just...
Glad you're up. That's all.


--- A1 ---

You know, I'm starting to enjoy these visits.


Hahaha!
You can sleep through the sound of my 
voice, eh?
Let's see, if you wake up before this incense 
burns down, then I win.
Do your sleepy best!


Aw, you woke up awfully fast.
Guess that means I win.
My reward? You and I having a good chat 
one day soon.


Good morning!
You woke up fast.
That must mean...
you're enjoying these visits too.


--- A2 ---

I, Prince Fogado...
from the queendom of Solm...shall now awaken 
the Divine Dragon!


So, hey...
We talked about going for dinner once I really 
earned it.
You remember?
I just want you to know that I really am looking 
forward to that.


You're up!
Then I'm off.
I've got training.
And lots of it! Gotta earn that meal.
Right, Divine One?


Whoa, you woke up quick.
We have some time.
So let's chat. Tell me, what's your 
favorite food?


--- S1 ---

Divine sleepyhead! Time to get up and at 'em!


Ever since you gave me the Pact Ring, I've 
been in such a good mood!
You're the best ally a prince could ask for.
I just wish we had more time to kick back and 
relax together.
You are leading an entire army, so I get it, 
I get it. You're busy...I guess.
But one of these days, when things settle down, 
I hope we can just enjoy hanging out like this.


Morning, sunshine.
Yeah, yeah, I'm greedy. I know I am.
I'm so happy you gave me the ring.
Can you really blame a guy...
for wanting your time too?


Ah, sorry.
That was loud.
Didn't mean to startle you. Really.
No, no. Don't go back to sleep.
Divine One, come, let's get this beautiful 
day started.


--- S2 ---

Nothing makes me happier than coming to 
wake you up.


How 'bout this...
Let's eat at that little restaurant again.
I'm being real here...
You are my favorite dinner companion.
Seriously. This is not rascal talk, I swear.
If I could eat every dinner with you...
the very best ally of all time...
I'd die a happy prince.


Listening were you?
What can I say?
We don't know when we'll die.
So we gotta be honest with each other when 
we can.
And honestly, I love being your ally.


And good morning!
Were you waiting for me?
'Course you were.
You're such a thoughtful ally.
Sleepy but thoughtful.
