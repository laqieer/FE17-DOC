[Alcryst] 
Excuse me, Princess Hortensia?
[Hortensia] 
Prince Alcryst? What's up? You're not usually 
much of a talker.
[Alcryst] 
Well, I was just, uh...
[Alcryst] 
No, never mind. It's not important.
[Hortensia] 
Nope! No running off after a buildup like that!
[Hortensia] 
Come on, spit it out!
[Alcryst] 
...
[Hortensia] 
Nopeâ”€didn't hear you. Louder.
[Alcryst] 
I, uh... I...
[Alcryst] 
Please teach me how to be more confident!
[Hortensia] 
Ow! Too loud!
[Hortensia] 
Tone it down, back it up, and explain 
yourself properly.
[Alcryst] 
You always have such boundless confidence, 
Princess Hortensia. It amazes me.
[Alcryst] 
I don't think very highly of myself...so I hoped 
you might teach me to be more like you.
[Hortensia] 
Aaah, OK. Yeah, makes sense.
[Hortensia] 
Too bad for you though! I'm not teaching 
you a thing.
[Hortensia] 
Maybe if you weren't a prince of Brodia, I'd 
have considered it. But you? Nope. No way.
[Alcryst] 
Of course. I understand...
[Hortensia] 
Wait, what?
[Alcryst] 
Brodia has invaded Elusia more times than I 
can count. You have every right to deny me.
[Alcryst] 
Besides, you shouldn't waste your precious 
time on someone as worthless as me.
[Alcryst] 
Honestly, I'm shocked by my own impertinence. 
How embarrassing... I'll leave you be.
[Alcryst] 
[Hortensia] 
Hang on a sec! I never said that!
[Alcryst] 1 

[Alcryst] 
It's all right. Please, forget I even approached 
you like this.
[Alcryst] 
I won't sully your ears with my pitiful mumbles 
ever again. You have my word.
[Alcryst] 
[Hortensia] 
Wait! Prince Alcryst!
[Hortensia] 
Hm, I was so sure he'd get mad and snap back. 
He's even worse off than I thought.
[Hortensia] 
I'll have to try a new approach the next time 
I see him.

[Hortensia] 
Prince Alcryst.
[Alcryst] 
...
[Hortensia] 
Hey! I know you can hear me!
[Alcryst] 
Ah...Princess Hortensia!
[Alcryst] 
Please, speaking to me will only dampen 
your mood.
[Hortensia] 
Always a bundle of joy, you are. But that's 
exactly what I wanna talk to you about.
[Hortensia] 
Listen. I'm gonna help you get some confidence, 
just like you asked.
[Alcryst] 
What? Really?! Oh, thank you!
[Alcryst] 
Why did you change your mind? You seemed 
so strongly opposed to it earlier.
[Hortensia] 
That was a joke. I got carried away. Sorry.
[Hortensia] 
I may not love Brodia, but you're my friend.
[Hortensia] 
And when a friend's in trouble, you help. 
Simple as that.
[Alcryst] 
Princess Hortensia, I... I...
[Hortensia] 
Hey! What's with all the tears?!
[Hortensia] 
Actually, you're kinda cute when you get all 
emotional. Anyway, let's get started, shall we?
[Alcryst] 
N-no, don't come any closer. Please, don't look 
at me like this...
[Hortensia] 
Huh?
[Hortensia] 
What's the problem this time?
[Hortensia] 
Are you really gonna turn down my help after 
all that?!
[Alcryst] 
You called me a friend. You agreed to help me...
[Alcryst] 
Princess Hortensia... You are, without a shadow 
of a doubt, a wonderful person.
[Alcryst] 
But the more wonderful you are, the deeper I 
tumble into despair...
[Hortensia] 
What?
[Alcryst] 
Your kind heart shines too bright! It reveals my 
heart for the worm-ridden filth that it is!
[Alcryst] 
So please, don't come near me! Spare me! 
I am so, so sorry!
[Alcryst] 
[Hortensia] 
That boy has self-deprecation down to 
an art form.

[Hortensia] 
Prince Alcryst.
[Alcryst] 
Princess Hortensia!
[Hortensia] 
Hey, before you run away, you should know 
I've decided to stop trying to help you.
[Hortensia] 
I don't think anything I do is gonna suddenly 
make you confident.
[Alcryst] 
That feels like the right decision. I know it was 
me who came to you for help at first.
[Hortensia] 
Yeah, and that was pretty rude.
[Alcryst] 
I understand. Once again, I apologize.
[Alcryst] 
To make things right, you're free to ignore me 
from this point forward.
[Hortensia] 
Nope. I refuse.
[Alcryst] 
Huh?
[Hortensia] 
Look. You're a quivering pile of pessimism, 
and maybe that's not gonna change.
[Hortensia] 
Either way, I accept you exactly as you are.
[Alcryst] 
What?
[Hortensia] 
I think I understand why you came to me 
for help in the first place.
[Hortensia] 
It was because you thought confidence would 
bring you closer to people, right?
[Alcryst] 
Well...yes.
[Alcryst] 
I thought that gaining confidence might lead to 
more meaningful friendships with everyone.
[Hortensia] 
Lovely sentiment, but you don't need to 
reinvent yourself for it.
[Hortensia] 
Sure, you're kind of a downer. So what? 
You've got plenty of great qualities too.
[Hortensia] 
That's why we're friends. You don't need to 
change a thing.
[Alcryst] 
Really? Thank you, Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia] 
Eh, just being honest.
[Alcryst] 
You are honest but also kind. I still feel the light 
from your radiant heart, and yet...
[Alcryst] 
This time, I can remain by your side... Perhaps 
it's because I understand you better.
[Hortensia] 
Hey, how about that? You're looking me 
in the eye!
[Alcryst] 
I am. I want to make up for how I acted before. 
I feel ashamed to have run from you like that.
[Hortensia] 
Now you're, uh...getting pretty close to me...
[Hortensia] 
Hey, you're a prince. It's improper for you to... 
look at me like...
[Hortensia] 
Aaah! That's supposed to be my thiiing!
[Hortensia] 

[Alcryst] 
Princess Hortensia?
[Alcryst] 
Haha, now I know how it feels to talk to me.
