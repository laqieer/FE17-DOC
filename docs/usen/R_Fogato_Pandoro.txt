[Pandreo]
Well, that's over and done with! Was that easy
or was that easy?
[Pandreo]
Those losers thought they were tough, but we
showed them, eh?
[Pandreo]
AROOO!
[Fogado]
Uh, yeah. Aroo...
[Pandreo]
Oh, come on!
[Fogado]
What?
[Pandreo]
You're bumming me out here.
[Fogado]
Oh, sorry.
[Pandreo]
"Oh, sorry." Give me a break!
[Pandreo]
Lighten up. Seeing you down in the dumps like
this freaks me out.
[Pandreo]
Let's dance it out, come on! Arf! Arf, arf, arf!
[Fogado]
Ruff... Rawr... Rawr...
[Pandreo]
Ugh, no!
[Pandreo]
Now I know something's up. What happened?
Bunet leave a hair in your chowder?
[Fogado]
Sorry. I was just thinking.
[Pandreo]
About?
[Fogado]
Uh...
[Fogado]
The party.
[Pandreo]
What?! That's why you're so distracted?
[Fogado]
Yeah. I just can't wait to tear up that
dance floor.
[Pandreo]
Aw, yeah! There's the prince of parties I know
and love!
[Pandreo]
Come on. Let's get you to that bash before
you pass out.
[Fogado]
Woo. Can't wait to...party down.
[Pandreo]
Same! AROOO!

[Pandreo]
Good going back there! Those guys were
pretty tough.
[Fogado]
Yep, they were.
[Pandreo]
Whaddaya say we celebrate the win by partying
till we can't see straight?
[Fogado]
Ugh...
[Pandreo]
Uh... Something wrong?
[Fogado]
Sorry, Pandreo, but I'm gonna take a rain check.
[Pandreo]
What?!
[Pandreo]
No, no. My ears must be playing tricks on me.
Fogado turning down a party?
[Pandreo]
What's going on? You eat something that's not
agreeing with you?
[Fogado]
...
[Fogado]
Ha, just kidding! Heh heh... You should have
seen the look on your face.
[Pandreo]
Aw, man! You really had me going there.
[Fogado]
Haha, sorry. Thought it would be fun to mess
with you a little bit.
[Pandreo]
Geez! Breaking a guy's heart─you call that fun?
[Fogado]
Pandreo, before I forget... Will you hear my
confession soon?
[Pandreo]
Better not be another cruel prank. Fool me
once, et cetera.
[Pandreo]
As long as you promise not to yank my chain
again...of course I'll hear your confession.
[Fogado]
Thanks, Pandreo. I appreciate it.

[Fogado]
Pandreo, I am ready to make a confession.
[Pandreo]
OK, I'm ready. What do you wish to confess?
[Fogado]
You see, I...I lied to my friend. To you.
[Pandreo]
Huh?
[Fogado]
It's...the war, Pandreo. I'm not sure we can win.
Our enemies are getting stronger.
[Fogado]
I'm so worried for the future I can barely sleep.
[Fogado]
The other day, when I told you I was distracted
because of the party? That was a lie.
[Fogado]
I just...couldn't stop thinking a-about...all the
people who could die on my watch.
[Pandreo]
Aw, buddy...
[Fogado]
I'm not the happy-go-lucky guy you think I am.
[Fogado]
I know it's my job to keep a smile on. I just...
I'm so damn scared, Pandreo.
[Pandreo]
I appreciate you telling me.
[Fogado]
Only after pulling the wool over your eyes.
[Pandreo]
Nah, don't flatter yourself. I saw right
through it.
[Fogado]
You did?
[Pandreo]
Of course. How gullible do you think I am?
I can tell when my friend's feeling blue.
[Pandreo]
I'm not a prince, so I won't pretend I can fix it,
or that I really know what you're feeling.
[Pandreo]
But what I can do is promise that I'll always
support you. As your retainer and your friend.
[Pandreo]
So, don't worry. Uh, let me rephrase that. Worry
to your heart's content. I'll still be here.
[Fogado]
That's all I need.
[Pandreo]
Good. Because at the end of the day, that's all
I can offer.
[Fogado]
Ah, that's strange... My vision's gone blurry.
[Pandreo]
Hey, hey, hey. Crying's not allowed, you hear?
Because if you do, I'm gonna.
[Fogado]
No, I'm not crying. Not quite, at least.
[Pandreo]
Ah, whew.
[Pandreo]
You know, this reminds me. It was during a
confession you told me you were the prince.
[Fogado]
That's right. I used to go to your parents'
church all the time. You and I were fast friends.
[Pandreo]
And then you dropped that on me. Easily one of
my top five most interesting confessions.
[Pandreo]
I almost forgot to breathe─I was so shocked.
[Fogado]
Well, you were looking for Panette. I had to tell
you she'd become my sister's retainer.
[Fogado]
And if you didn't know I was the prince, you
wouldn't have bought it.
[Pandreo]
And the next thing you said was even more
shocking. You turned to me and asked...
[Fogado]
How's a job as my retainer sound?
[Pandreo]
That's right. Ah, that brings me back. The seven
most beautiful words I've ever heard.
[Pandreo]
And as your retainer, I'm not just here for the
highs, all right? I'm here for the lows too.
[Pandreo]
Whether you need a buddy on the dance floor
or a shoulder to cry on, I can be that.
[Fogado]
Thank you, Pandreo.
[Fogado]
I gotta say, I'm gladder than ever that I was so
honest in my confession back then.
