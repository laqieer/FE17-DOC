Food must taste especially delicious here.


It seems I have a bit of time.
While I wait, perhaps I'll sample these herbs 
I grew.
Mmm. This one has a spicy note to it.
And this one... Mmm...yes, a subtle sweetness.


Divine One...
May I ask your opinion?
Which of these herbs do you prefer?
Give them a taste and, please, be honest.


Good morning.
Would you like breakfast down below?
Or perhaps I could bring it up here for you?


--- C2 ---

Are there no new flavors to explore?


I don't see any ingredients here. A shame.
Though, there is that pillar and, of course, 
the bed. They're not ingredients per se...
Still, I can't help but wonder what they 
taste like.
They are pure white and certainly look 
quite delicious.


Good morning.
Sorry to bother you, but might I have a taste 
of that pillar or even your bed?
No. I'm not joking. Why do you ask?


Divine One!
Is there anything in this room that I might taste?
I'm always on the hunt for new and unique 
flavors, you see.

I've noticed that the Divine Dragon sometimes 
has difficulty waking up.


Today, it seems, is one of those days.
Well, there's no better way to wake up than 
to the smell of food.
Let's see... Chop the ingredients, add a bit of 
heat...now a dash of seasoning...
And it's nearly done...


Good morning.
What do you think?
Do you like waking up to the sounds and smells 
of cooking?
Eh, before you answer...
You'll want to wipe the drool from your mouth.


Ah, well, apparently not today.
I shall make you a warm breakfast at once.


--- B2 ---

Why... Yes, I smell an unfamiliar dish once again.


It does not seem to come from the Divine 
Dragon's clothes.
I mean surely...
the Divine One wouldn't spill food that 
many times.
But where could it be coming from?


Divine One, please, what is that smell?
What?! You've been hiding a nighttime snack 
all this while?
Eh...that is hardly advisable.
Food should not be stored at room temperature.


Is that aroma coming up from downstairs?
Pardon me, I'll be right back...
I must check on something cooking in 
the kitchen.

Ugh... I'm at a loss for fresh new meal ideas.
Ah, I've stumbled upon the Divine 
Dragon's room...


Your hair, Divine One...every time I see it, I'm 
mesmerized by how unusual it is.
Ah! An idea! I'll use the same ingredients...
but employ a unique method of preparation!


Good morning.
And thank you, Divine One!
You have helped me out of a culinary funk.
Your uniqueness...
has inspired a unique dish.


I'm sorry.
I was wandering, lost in thought, when I so 
rudely woke you.
Please, let me make it up to you.
I'll bake a sweet treat for you one day soon.

This room has me thinking about...baking 
a cake.
Yes...it could be beautiful.


Hmm, if I'm baking for the Divine Dragon...
I must not think only of flavor, but of 
presentation too.
Ah! Perhaps I could bake a cake that looks 
like the entire Somniel itself?!


You are awake, I see.
Now that those tomato and blueberry eyes of 
yours are open, I must tell you...
you've fueled my creative appetite once again.


I think I'll cook something for you again, 
Divine One.
This place you once slept in for a 
thousand years...
has given me a sweet idea.

Breakfast is ready.
It is time to get up, don't you think, 
my dear partner?


As I expected. Still asleep.
Well, I've prepared a sweet dish for you.
It is sweet like our relationship is now and, 
I hope, always will be.
Life is full of so many different flavors, and I've 
tried to taste as many as I could.
But this time we share together, it tastes like 
nothing else I've ever encountered.
Our recipe is unique and perfect, and it belongs 
to us and us alone.


Now, eat up so you can win your battles.
Tomorrow, and the day after that...
I want to watch you taste all life has to offer.
And I want to be there to make sure...
it's delicious.


Haha, now be honest.
Was it the word "breakfast" that stirred you 
from your slumber...
or was it your excitement to see me?
I choose to believe it was the latter.


--- S2 ---

No food from me.
This time I've brought you flowers, Divine One.


When you gave me the ring...
you said there was so much for us to learn 
about each other.
I want to learn everything about you, and 
I want to tell you everything about me.
You should know, I'm growing these flowers 
as a hobby.
They're my favorite species.
Its red petals are so bright and bold. 
And the blue bud...
Its scent is almost as sweet as you.


Good morning.
Now be honest, do you prefer my delicious food 
or my beautiful flowers?
Though, you need not worry...
I will be happy to wake you with both from 
now on.


You know...
I enjoy growing flowers and herbs.
Now, next time I come...
you must tell me something about yourself.
I want to know everything. The sweet things, 
and yes, the sour things too.
