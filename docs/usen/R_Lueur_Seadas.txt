[Seadall]
♪Hmm hmm hmm...♪
[Alear]
Practicing your dancing tonight, Seadall?
[Seadall]
Ah, Divine One.
[Seadall]
It's not so much practice as it is performance.
I have an audience tonight, after all.
[Alear]
But there's no one around.
[Seadall]
There's the moon.
[Alear]
The moon?
[Seadall]
That's right. The silver light shining in the
dark above.
[Seadall]
And the multitude of stars too. I perform for
them all tonight.
[Seadall]
Divine One, did you know that when people die,
they leave their form behind and become stars?
[Seadall]
My teacher is up in that sky.
[Alear]
This teacher of yours died then?
[Seadall]
He did. These dance steps were the ones he
loved most.
[Seadall]
♪Hmm hmm hmm...♪
[Alear]
It's beautiful, Seadall. Every single movement
is just...gorgeous.
[Seadall]
I give up many of life's pleasures in pursuit of
perfecting the craft of my dance.
[Seadall]
It's not easy. I practice my steps intently, and
I am vigilant about what fuels my dance.
[Seadall]
My dancing skills are renowned in Solm.
Complacency and mediocrity are not an option.
[Alear]
You're so disciplined. I respect that.
[Alear]
And there's something otherworldly about you.
Sometimes I'm not sure I should get too close.
[Seadall]
May I resume dancing now?
[Alear]
Oh! Yes, of course. I'm sorry I interrupted you.

[Seadall]
Spirit of the cards! Moon and stars above!
Cast your divine light and answer me!
[Alear]
Seadall? What is he trying to divine with
such...desperation?
[Seadall]
I beg you to tell me...will this food offer the
perfect fuel for my dance?
[Seadall]
I yearn for more than merely food. I crave the
savory! Please, spirit of the cards!
[Seadall]
Ugh! That was not the answer I wanted!
[Alear]
Uh...he's not acting like he did before. Not at all.
[Alear]
Please, calm down, Seadall.
[Seadall]
Divine One!
[Alear]
I don't know what this is about, but this isn't
like you at all. Crave...the savory?
[Seadall]
Are you trying to tell me that eating this will
provide the perfect fuel for my dance?
[Seadall]
It's dough fried in butter and then bathed
in an oil sauce...and it's incredibly delicious.
[Alear]
Oh, I had one of those. It was delicious, all right.
I'd think it'd be extra fuel for your dance.
[Seadall]
Are you making that up?
[Alear]
Well...
[Seadall]
Or just guessing? I'll need to consult the cards
for the real answer.
[Alear]
I mean, I think I do know!
[Alear]
You're doing all that dancing. It's got to be
good fuel and tasty too!
[Seadall]
You don't understand. A dancer of my caliber
must be disciplined.
[Seadall]
On the battlefield, I must inspire all with my
perfect dancing. So I must eat only perfect food.
[Seadall]
If I'm careless, if my dancing suffers and
someone dies... I can't allow that.
[Alear]
Seadall, I'm sorry...
[Seadall]
Now, I must retreat to the fortune shop, and to
a meal that is not fried.
--- A ---



[Alear]
Seadall, please, hear me out... I think your
dancing is perfect.
[Alear]
And enjoying the things you love every now
and again won't change that.
[Seadall]
What's this all about?
[Alear]
I understand that your dancing is as beautiful as
it is because you're so disciplined.
[Alear]
But if you eat only to fuel the dance, you're
not thinking how savory feeds the soul.
[Seadall]
Savory feeds...the soul?
[Alear]
Your inner joy surely must also be part of
your dance, right?
[Alear]
When you danced in the moonlight thinking of
those who had died...that was truly beautiful.
[Alear]
I'm sure that dancing while dreaming of savory
foods must be distracting.
[Seadall]
You're trying to tell me my dance is less
perfect because of this?
[Alear]
Fuel your dance with things that bring you
joy─we will feel the joy too.
[Alear]
I understand that you want to dance perfectly
to protect your friends in battle.
[Alear]
All the more reason to fuel your moves with
savory food too.
[Seadall]
Divine One, you don't understand.
[Seadall]
If I fuel my dance with just anything I want,
that's playing with fire.
[Seadall]
My life as a dancer has always put function
before flavor.
[Alear]
...
[Seadall]
But...I am starting to see what you mean about
savory feeding the soul.
[Seadall]
You're very thoughtful and that makes me
happy. Thank you.
[Alear]
You're welcome.
[Seadall]
And given you are the Divine One, I will take
your advice to heart.
[Seadall]
In fact, that fried dough bathed in oil sauce
from the other day─it's been on my mind.
[Alear]
Then let's go order some!
[Seadall]
Now the question is, how much savory is too
much savory for one sitting?
[Alear]
Perhaps we should consult the "spirit of
the cards"?
[Seadall]
Ah, you saw my reading the other day.
[Seadall]
Divine One, I'm afraid you've only seen my
undignified side lately.
[Alear]
I've seen your charming side as well.
[Seadall]
I promise you this, from now on you'll see
a better me.
[Seadall]
I realize now the dance is both an inside and
outside dance. Expect perfection!
[Alear]
I'm happy if you're happy, Seadall.

[Seadall]
Divine One, I've been waiting for you. I'd like to
perform a special dance for you tonight.
[Alear]
A special dance?
[Seadall]
That's right. It's a dance meant for an audience
of one─for you alone.
[Seadall]
Let me begin.

[Alear]
Seadall, that was incredible. I'm genuinely
moved!
[Seadall]
I did what you said. I fed my soul with savory
dishes and let it move me.
[Alear]
Haha! I'm really glad to hear that. But why the
special dance?
[Seadall]
First, let me tell you what the dance means.
[Alear]
Yes, please.
[Seadall]
The dance is a promise─a promise I can
perform for one person only.
[Seadall]
You are very special to me, .
[Alear]
...
[Seadall]
I'll say it plainly. I've cared for you ever since
we met at that fortress.
[Seadall]
Others hold you dear, I know. How could they
not? But their feelings can't compare to mine.
[Seadall]
So I wonder, is it possible you feel something
like I do in return?
[Alear]
Seadall, let me explain.
[Seadall]
I'm sorry, that was incredibly forward of me.
[Alear]
No, I'm happy you said it. I'm even happier
you feel that way. Because I feel the same.
[Seadall]
You do?
[Alear]
I do. In fact, I've been thinking that this ring...
would look perfect on you.
[Seadall]
The Pact Ring?
[Alear]
The very one.
[Seadall]
I feel like the moon and all the stars have lit up
inside my chest.
[Seadall]
I promise you, I will work hard and make you
proud to have me standing by your side.
[Alear]
Hehe, you shine so brightly, I only hope I can
add a bit more glow.
[Alear]
Seadall, I'm so happy we get to walk this
path together.
[Seadall]
...
[Seadall]
Nothing in this lovely, mysterious world could
keep me from you.
