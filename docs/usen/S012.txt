[Alear]
Where are we? I don't recognize it.
[Roy]
It looks like... No, it couldn't be.
[Alear]
Roy? Do you know this place?
[Roy]
I may be seeing what I want to see, instead of
what's truly there, but it's very similar...
[Roy]
to a place where I once fought an important
battle.
[Alear]
Oh. Do you mean in the world you're from?
Could you tell me about it?
[Roy]
I stood there, my allies at my side, facing down
the armies of the kingdom of Bern.
[Roy]
The enemy's commander was Murdock, who
was especially strong─tactically and physically.
[Roy]
His battle axe... The power and weight of its
blows are etched forever in my memory.
[Roy]
It was a battle so grueling, I can hardly believe
that I, or anyone else, managed to survive.
[Roy]
But bitter as it was, I hold fond memories of
that day as well.
[Alear]
It must be an important point in time for you.
[Roy]
Yes, you could say that. I admit I feel a bit
energized standing here.
[Roy]
, would you grant me an odd
request? Battle me here, in this place.
[Alear]
Battle you? But why?
[Roy]
This place is from my memory, but I believe it
is a trial meant for you.
[Roy]
Achieve a glorious victory against me, and our
bond will grow deeper still.
[Roy]
My power will grow, and yours will too.
Are you interested?
[Alear]
All right, I'll fight you. And I'll win.

[Roy]
Thank you for entertaining my wish to fight.
You're impressive.
[Alear]
You would have won if I'd slipped up even once.
I never want to have you as an enemy again.
[Roy]
Please, you're embarrassing me.
[Roy]
...
[Alear]
What's wrong, Roy? You're staring.
[Roy]
Oh... It's just that you remind me of somebody
I once knew. Her name was Idunn.
[Roy]
She was a Demon Dragon, and King Zephiel of
Bern wished to use her to destroy humanity.
[Alear]
A Demon Dragon?
[Roy]
Like you, each of her eyes was of a different
color. And she carried herself a bit like you too.
[Alear]
I never knew there was such a person... Did you
battle this Demon Dragon?
[Roy]
Well, I had a choice: kill her and wipe out the
dragons, or save her...the enemy of mankind.
[Roy]
Can you guess which I chose?
[Alear]
Which was it?
[Roy]
I'll tell you the whole tale once this war is over
and your world is at peace.
[Alear]
Aww... OK, then. But you have to promise me
you'll tell. I'm looking forward to the story.
[Roy]
I promise, . Until that day comes,
I think we'll enjoy our time together.

[Roy]
Relax
[Roy]
I'm looking forward to seeing how you
approach this battle.


[Alear]
Is that the sound of huge wings?! It sounds
like wyverns...
[Alear]
They might be reinforcements for Roy's troops.
I should advance with caution.

[Alear]
You seem much more focused─more intense
than usual.
[Roy] Die
[Roy]
My sword, the Binding Blade, was kept in this
land for centuries.
[Roy]
My memory of retrieving it must be granting me
additional power.

[Alear]
If a memory can grant power, then I'll give you
a fight we'll both remember!

[Roy]
Relax
[Roy]
Oh, you're to be my opponent? Well then,
I'd best not relax.
[Diamant]
It pleases me that you would say so─I feel
the same.
[Diamant]
It is my duty to show the Emblem entrusted
to Brodia a spectacular fight!
[Roy]
This will be quite the battle then. Come on,
Diamant. Fight!



[Alcryst]
L-Lord Roy? Is there not someone more, um,
adequate you should be fighting?
[Roy]
Why are you talking nonsense, Alcryst?
[Roy]
You are the prince of Brodia─the land I was
entrusted to. Who better could I face?
[Roy]
Come. Let our battle begin!
