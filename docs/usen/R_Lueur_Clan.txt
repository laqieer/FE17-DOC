[Clanne] 
Divine One, what are you doing?
[Alear] 
Oh, hello, Clanne.
[Alear] 
I was just tidying up a bit. Tomorrow's a busy 
day, so I thought I'd get it out of the way now.
[Clanne] 
Let me take care of that. You should get 
some rest!
[Alear] 
That's all right. I can handle it.
[Clanne] 
No, no. That won't do. I'm gonna have to insist.
[Alear] 
But...
[Clanne] 
Please? You know, I waited a long time for you 
to wake up.
[Clanne] 
And not just me. The stewards before me spent 
their whole lives waiting.
[Clanne] 
Now, after a thousand years, I get to serve you! 
It's like a miracle.
[Clanne] 
So...please, let me do it. Honestly, truly, I would 
be honored to help.
[Alear] 
Very well, you've convinced me. I'll leave it 
to you.
[Clanne] 
Thank you, Divine One.
[Alear] 
I should be thanking you for taking such great 
care of me.
[Alear] 
I'm very lucky to have you as a steward.
[Clanne] 
You mean it?! Oh man. I'm so happy I could 
faint!
[Alear] 
Haha, please don't. Now that I'm free from 
tidying up, I'm going to get some rest.

[Alear] 
Um, Clanne?
[Clanne] 
Uh... Ugh...
[Alear] 
Psst. Clanne. Clanne!
[Clanne] 
AH! My apologies, Divine One!
[Alear] 
Is everything OK? You were really out of it.
[Clanne] 
I'm fine. Got a little distracted, that's all.
[Alear] 
OK... Listen. I think you might be wearing 
yourself out.
[Clanne] 
What? No, I'm not! I was just...uh...
[Clanne] 
I'm...really not...
[Alear] 
Admit it. Your plate's too full with everything 
you do for me.
[Clanne] 
What? No! Absolutely not! If anything, it's not 
full enough!
[Clanne] 
Pile my plate with more of those tasty, tasty 
responsibilities! Anything for the Divine Dragon!
[Clanne] 
Seriously, whatever you tell me to do, I'll do it. 
Go ahead! Give me an order!
[Alear] 
Well...if you insist...
[Alear] 
I order you to get some rest.
[Clanne] 
...
[Clanne] 
No fair! You cheated!
[Alear] 
Sorry. You're irreplaceable. I can't have you 
wearing yourself out.
[Alear] 
You have to take some time off so that you're 
ready in case the worst happens.
[Clanne] 
But... But...
[Alear] 
Rest, Clanne. That's an order.
[Clanne] 
All right.
[Clanne] 
If you insist, I'll just...lie down for a bit.

[Alear] 
Clanne, you're looking bright-eyed and 
bushy-tailed.
[Clanne] 
Yes, I'm feeling much better now that I've 
gotten some rest.
[Alear] 
Good. Please, try not to overwork yourself 
going forward, all right?
[Clanne] 
Uh...
[Clanne] 
Listen. It's like I said─we stewards waited a 
thousand years for you to wake up.
[Clanne] 
And you're as amazing as I imagined. No, even 
more so!
[Clanne] 
But I... I failed you.
[Clanne] 
I'm supposed to make your life easier. Instead, 
I made you worry about me.
[Clanne] 
I'm really sorry.
[Alear] 
"Sorry"? You're doing a great job, Clanne.
[Alear] 
It's really heartening to see how hard you work.
[Clanne] 
It is?!
[Alear] 
Yes. And not just that.
[Alear] 
I know you've always been there to support me. 
Even since before I woke up.
[Alear] 
I find it quite touching how deeply you care 
for me.
[Clanne] 
Yes, well... Of course, I...
[Clanne] 
...
[Alear] 
Clanne? Are you crying?
[Clanne] 
I'm just...really happy.
[Clanne] 
The Divine Dragon thinks I did a good job.
[Clanne] 
I'm going to keep on doing whatever I can to 
help you out.
[Alear] 
I appreciate that. But please...
[Clanne] 
I know, I know. I'll make sure not to push 
myself too hard.
[Alear] 
Haha, glad to hear it.

[Clanne] 
Divine Dragon... Can I talk to you about... 
It's about something serious.
[Alear] 
Of course, Clanne. What is it?
[Clanne] 
Ever since I was little, I wondered about the 
Divine Dragon.
[Clanne] 
I had so many ideas about who you were or 
what you might be like.
[Alear] 
Hah, so did I live up to what you imagined?
[Clanne] 
I think... I think it would be better if I hadn't 
met you.
[Alear] 
Huh?
[Clanne] 
...
[Clanne] 
If I only ever saw you asleep, like all the 
stewards before me, I wouldn't feel so...so...
[Alear] 
Clanne?
[Clanne] 
I know that, as a steward, I'm not supposed to 
be saying things like this. I know that...
[Clanne] 
But... But I... I want...
[Clanne] 
I want to be a great steward. Like I imagined 
I'd be─once you woke up, I mean.
[Clanne] 
I want to be who you call when you need help. 
But that can't happen... I'm not that strong.
[Alear] 
Clanne, that's...
[Alear] 
I've always found you an excellent steward.
[Clanne] 
I felt like I was, at first─when you were still 
asleep all the time. But now...
[Clanne] 
All I do is think about how I should help you 
more than I do. Or than I can.
[Alear] 
Clanne...
[Alear] 
I agree with you. Completely and totally. You 
should be helping me more than you are.
[Clanne] 
Oh... I...should?
[Alear] 
Indeed. And it's well past time we discussed 
this problem.
[Clanne] 
Huh?
[Alear] 
As my steward, you have many duties. One of 
which is to be my right hand. But you're not.
[Clanne] 
I-I'm not? But I try so hard, I mean... What do 
I mean? What do you mean?
[Alear] 
My steward cannot be all I need unless they 
are designated as my most important officer.
[Alear] 
Here. This is the Pact Ring. I have only the one, 
and you have earned it. Many times over.
[Alear] 
You understand what this is? Yes?
[Clanne] 
...
[Clanne] 
Oh, h-hang on... I'm so happy I'm dizzy.
[Alear] 
Clanne, you're swaying. Have a seat, before you 
fall over. Please.
[Clanne] 
The Pact Ring? For me? Ah, come on. You're 
just saying stuff to cheer me up.
[Alear] 
The pact can only be formed with my closest 
ally. Do you accept?
[Clanne] 
Um... I mean... If you say it's real, sure. Yes. 
Since this is definitely not a dream I'm having.
[Alear] 
To care from the heart for someone other than 
yourself? Most people aren't capable of that.
[Alear] 
But you are, Clanne. And I am thankful for your 
service. And your friendship.
[Clanne] 
Me too!
[Clanne] 
Divine Dragon . This new duty is 
an honor! I will be your steward forever.
