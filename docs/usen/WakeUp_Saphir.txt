This place is too damn quiet.


I'm no stranger to castles...
but this is a whole other kind of solemn.
Should have learned to mind my manners 
after all.


Good morning.
Thought I'd greet you properly.
Any conversation we have...
could be our last, y'know?


Good, you're up.
Guess it'd be tough to sleep through all my 
stomping around, huh?
Anyway, come on. Folks are waiting.


--- C2 ---

I wonder if it was ever someone's job to wake 
King Morion up...


Doesn't feel right to have the rank and file 
barge into a private chamber like this.
Then again, it's also a place of worship, isn't it?
OK, let's get this over with. Hey, Divine One!


Time to get up.
The sight of you...
is good for morale, y'know?
Go inspire the troops to give their all.


Hey, get up! Time to train.
Sluggish?
We'll fix that.

Got a live one this morning!


Ngh... Hold still!
So strong! Slippery!
Great, you're on the floor now! What's your 
escape plan, genius?
Hey, how are you doing that?! Come back!


We've got a runaway fish on the loose.
How far could it get, though, right?
I'll send word to the kitchen. It's only a matter 
of time.


Got your attention, huh?
Prince Diamant caught this.
The Somniel's got some huge fish!
We're gonna feast tonight.

You look so gentle, even dead asleep.


Straight as a sword too.
I sleep more like a worm on a hookâ”€all tossing 
and turning.
Sometimes I wake up after rolling right off 
the bed.


You're awake.
Up for some training this morning?
I'd be happy to join you.


Morning.
You sleep like a sculpture, you know.
Haven't you ever snored? Slept crooked? 
Rolled over?

Taking an afternoon nap, Divine One?
It's almost dinnertime.


You must be exhausted. I don't blame you.
Leading an army's tough. Always gotta be in 
top form.
I can't even fathom the pressure you must 
be under.


Don't rush.
Dinner can always wait.
I'll tell everyone...
you'll be down when you're ready.


Heh, I was worried you'd be exhausted...
but you shot right out of bed.
Ready for some grub?


--- A2 ---

It's time to train!
C'mon, let's get that blood pumping.


My friend...
I'm grateful for the talk we had recently.
I still want my revenge, but I'm in less of a rush 
for it now. It's a load off.


Hey, look who's finally up!
Huh?
'Course I'm in a good mood.
A positive attitude's important for training.
My friends expect no less.


Good!
We've got our work cut out for us.
I've gotta keep getting stronger if I want to do 
my part...
and make my old friend proud.

Time to get up, sparring partner.


Shape up, soldier! We've got work to do.
Was that too harsh?
Am I being too hard on you?
You signed up for this, picking me to be your 
sparring partner.
But I'm glad you did.
And I'm here to push you along every step of 
the way.


OK, let's get out there and give the next battle 
all we've got.
And let's come home safe.
I wanna keep training with you...
until I'm too old to train at all.


C'mon, let's go!
Another day, another battle!
Don't worry.
By the Pact Ring you gave me, I swear I'll watch 
your back out there.


--- S2 ---

Training time!
And if you think I'll go easy on you, think again!


Sleeping soundly as always.
Snoring a bit too.
Heh, I still can't believe you actually said 
you want to protect me.
As much as the ring you gave me, I treasure 
those words.
If I ever lose heart in battle...
it will be in those words that I find my courage.


Hey.
We're past training time, but...
No big deal.
I'm happy just spending time with you.
So, let's take the day off.


I can tell by your face you overslept.
What? Heh, I'd never get upset over a thing 
like that.
As you know...
outside of battle, I've got a soft heart.
