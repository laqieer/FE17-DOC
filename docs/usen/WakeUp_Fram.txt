Yoo-hoo, I'm here.


Sound asleep, huh?
I know that sleepy face so well.
But ya better wake up soon...
or it's tickle time!


The Divine Dragon is awaaake!
Haha, feeling a bit of déjà vu?
Well, good morning!


You're awake!
Aww, I bet you sensed my presence!


--- C2 ---

Heya, Divine One! Oopsie, you're asleep.


You must be tired.
Wish I could let ya sleep.
But no can do.
Divine One!


Arise, O Divine One!
Aww, I'm kidding. I'm no good at 
sounding proper.


Aww, you're up.
It's just, you look so relaxed when you sleep.


--- B1 ---

The Divine One looks so dignified! Gah! Dial 
down the enthusiasm, Framme.


Sorry I made a racket while you were training.
I wasn't trying to be a distraction.
I'm such a big fan, I just can't help myself.


What?! You're awake?!
Ahem. Good morning! Nothing noisy 
happening here.
Oof. Being quiet is not easy.


I'm sorry! I meant to come in quietly.
On my honor as your biggest fan, I promise 
I'll keep it down from now on.

Guess who did a bunch of cleaning! Oh, oops! 
The Divine Dragon's asleep...


I should wait till you're up...
Or I could clean up in here a bit too.
Throw out the trash, do a little dusting...
Oh no! The vase!


Sorry!
I can fix it. I swear.
At least the rest of the Somniel is nice 
and clean.


Gah! I woke you up! Sorry.
Just wanted to let you know the Somniel is 
sparkly clean!

Never fear! The co-president of the Divine 
Dragon Fan Club is here!


I'm so happy you want me to cheer for 
you again.
From now on, I'm gonna put my heart and soul 
into it.
I say, "wake," you say, "up!" Wake! Up!


Hey! Nice wake up!
Your biggest fan approves!
I'll be cheering for ya!


You're up! Good morning!
You are so good at waking up!
The best waker-upper in all of Elyos!

Good morning...
Are you sleeping? For real?


Hmm, how about a prank to wake this silly 
sleepy-head up.
I'll just tickle the Divine Dragon's nose with 
this...
Huh?! It's not working. Weird.


Divine One! You didn't sneeze?!
Normally, when you do this to someone's 
nose th-they...
Ah... Ah... Achoo!


Boo! You woke up!
I was gonna pull a really cute prank.
Hehe, I mean, forget I said anything.


--- S1 ---

It's Framme. I've come to wake you up.


Divine One, come on now, it's time you 
woke up. Really.
I'm gonna cheer. Loudly!
Hehe!
You know what. Never mind.
Go ahead and sleep.
I'll just tuck ya in and let ya snooze.


Well, good morning, Divine One.
I know it's hard to keep those sleepy eyes open.
But I promise, an amazing day is waiting for us!


Oh, you're already up.
Waiting for me, were ya?
Haha, no going back to sleep now!


--- S2 ---

I thought you'd be here.
Haha, I know you too well.


Sound asleep.
You look just like you did when I was watching 
over you.
I want to tell you something.
All that time you were sleeping...
I think deep down, I knew we'd be allies 
for always.


Haha, good morning!
I thought it'd be nice to let you sleep, but 
no way.
Your number one ally is waiting for ya!
Time to rise and shine!


You're not embarrassed I caught you sleeping, 
are you?
Aww...
I'm your biggest fan. You've got nothing 
to worry about ever.
