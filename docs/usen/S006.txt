[Alear] 
What is that? In the back there. Is that... 
a throne?
[Byleth] 
This resembles the Holy Tomb. That's a place 
from my world.
[Alear] 
What is the Holy Tomb?
[Byleth] 
It's where the goddess Sothis sleeps. For the 
Church of Seiros, this is the holiest place of all.
[Byleth] 
To ensure the safety of the tomb, a monastery 
was built atop it.
[Alear] 
OK... So, why is it here?
[Byleth] 
Only a very few know the legend of Saint Seiros 
and the Holy Tomb.
[Byleth] 
Saint Seiros received power and revelation from 
the goddess and, with it, a sacred duty.
[Byleth] 
She was to save the people of FÃ³dlan, and use 
her power wisely in order to lead them.
[Byleth] 
Perhaps it's inevitable that we'd be guided here.
[Alear] 
Why do you say that?
[Byleth] 
If the bond between us is to further strengthen, 
then you must face a trial here.
[Alear] 
I see. And you want me to fight you, Byleth?
[Byleth] 
Show me whether you can wisely use the power 
you've gained on your journey so far.
[Alear] 
Understood.
[Byleth] 
In your eyes, I see no hesitation. Good. 
Ready yourself!
[Alear] 
I'm ready. And I won't hold anything back!

[Alear] 
I managed to win...somehow.
[Byleth] 
Well done. Your fighting was magnificent. 
The trial is passed.
[Alear] 
I learned so much battling you.
[Byleth] 
Thank you, but your skills were quite strong 
even before we met.
[Alear] 
Still, you've taught me so many things.
[Alear] 
You're an excellent teacher, Byleth.
[Byleth] 
That's kind of you to say. Though it helps that 
you have such raw skill already.
[Byleth] 
All I need do is listen and give a little nudge 
to those embarking on a path.
[Byleth] 
Your success here is the direct result of all the 
choices you've made before today.
[Alear] 
I've always understood that one choice leads 
to another, but...
[Alear] 
I'm worried what might happen if I ever make 
the wrong choice...
[Byleth] 
You needn't worry at all. By passing this trial, 
you've shown the truth of who you are.
[Byleth] 
And you have your allies to set you right... 
should you ever begin to stray.
[Byleth] 
Remember, I will always be by your side 
as well. To the very end.
[Alear] 
Thank you. I'll continue on my path, trusting my 
allies to help me along the way.
[Byleth] 
You've clearly learned all you need to here. 
Shall we continue on our journey?

To win the fight, keep your eyes wide. Always 
know where your enemies are.

[Alear] Surprise 

[Alear] 
What are those things scattered around 
the battlefield?
[Byleth] b 
[Byleth] StandBy 
[Byleth] 
Those are my targets, and I will destroy them... 
Unless you can prevent me from doing so.
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
I'll guard them well!

[Byleth] 
Depending on the wielder, power can be used 
for good or evil with equal ease.
[Byleth] StandBy 
[Byleth] 
That's why the heart of the one controlling 
the power is important.
[Alear] t 
[Alear] Surprise 

[Alear] 
The heart. That would mean...
[Alear] Strike 

[Alear] 
My heart determines how the power is used... 
All right, Byleth. I'm ready!

[Hortensia] t 
[Hortensia] Sad 
[Hortensia] 
I've gotta say it feels a little weird to fight 
someone who's supposed to be an ally.
[Byleth] b 
[Byleth] 
Smile 
[Byleth] 
Just because we're fighting doesn't make us 
enemies. Not this time.
[Byleth] 
We're still friends. But for now, prepare 
for battle.
[Hortensia] Strike 
[Hortensia] 
OK. I've got no choice but to fight? Let's do it.
