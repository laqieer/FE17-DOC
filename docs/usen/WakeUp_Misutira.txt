Ciao, Divine One! It's a beautiful day!


Am I early?
I'll just sing a little something while I wait. 
Ahem!
♪Morning time! Here's the sunshine!♪
♪Dream on, O great dragon divine!♪


♪Ooo, Divine One! You just woke up in time!♪
Haha, sorry!
That was loud. But hey, good morning!


Yes! You're up!
Ready for action, I see.
That's the kinda commander we need!


--- C2 ---

I'm starving! C'mon, Divine One, let's go 
get something to eat!
Oh, you're asleep...


I know...
I'm gonna whisper in your ear.
Grilled meat, deep-fried fish...
freshly baked bread, juicy fruit, cake lathered 
in frosting...


Yay, you woke up!
Let's find some tasty grub!
Ooo, you know what I really want?
Extra helpings!


Yay, you're up!
C'mon, chow time!
Ugh, I'm always so hungry, you know?
Hah! Probably 'cause I never sit still.


--- B1 ---

Running over here made me hungry.
I'll just make myself a snack while I wait 
for you to wakey-wakey.


Just gonna light a teensy fire, put the meat 
on, and...
Oh, look at that! Grilled to perfection!
Oh... OH NO! This fire is HUGE!
Water! I've gotta throw some water on it! Hyah!


Haha... Uh, nope, not at all.
No meat roasting here.
C'mon, let's go get some food.
I'm starving!


Morning!
Good thing you're up!
I was about to get a bonfire going and grill 
up some meat!


--- B2 ---

Divine One, I need your help! I grilled up 
way too much meat!


I'm serious...
I need you to help me eat it all.
And no...
I'm not trying to trick you into helping me 
raid a bandit hideout.


You're up!
OK, before we defeat our enemies, we have 
to defeat this huge pile o' meat!
No leftovers!
No wasting!


Sorry.
It's just...
everyone's stuffed!
Only your stomach can save us!

♪Oh, Divine Dragon, my dear...♪
♪I see you slumbering here! You'll miss the 
whole day...I fear!♪


Hmm...I can't believe you slept through 
my singing!
You must find it soothing.
Funny. Mom flies awake after one verse.


Ciao!
It's so pretty out!
I know...
You and me should kick back and relax.


Lalala─ Oh!
You're up!
Well, it looks like I got here early, so...
Wanna go for a walk with me?


--- A2 ---

Guess who?
I'll be impressed if you can figure it out.


Maybe you need more clues.
Well, you and I fought some bandits the 
other day.
We were totally surrounded.
But we totally beat 'em, of course.


Morning!
You knew who it was, didn't ya?
I mean, how could you not?
We make an amazing team, after all!


Ta-da!
The one and only Timerra, of course!
Your good ol' bandit-fightin' pal.
But you knew right away, didn't ya?


--- S1 ---

It's me, Divine One! I bet you could tell from my 
beautiful voice, right?


Hehe, don't wake up if you don't want to.
This is really nice too.
I just wish we could go on like this forever.
My lifetime though...
Well, let's just say I'll be leaving the party 
first, ya know?
But hey, if I disappear...
make sure you get up in the mornings, OK?


Morning!
Just so you know...
you are amazing, and being here with you 
is heavenly.
Oh, and even when I'm the queen of Solm...
I hope I can wish you good morning like this 
every single day.


Good morning!
Yeah, I can't start my day without seeing 
that incredible face of yours.
So, let's make it through the day in one piece.
That way I can say good morning to you 
tomorrow too.


--- S2 ---

I've been dying to see you!
So I won't apologize if I wake you up.


The thing is, you giving me the Pact Ring...
I never thought it would give me so 
much freedom.
Now that I have it, I can lend you my strength.
And I can come and go whenever I choose.
But...it's funny.
I have all this freedom.
And yet, I just want to be near you.


Morning!
Now that I've seen you...
I'm off to train.
I think you're amazing!
And I hope...
you feel the same. Always.


Hehe, maybe I should have waited.
But you and I are connected now.
And you told me I was free to see you whenever 
I liked.
And I liked now.
