[Citrinne] 
Hmm...
[Veyle] 
Oh, um, why are you looking at me like that?
[Citrinne] 
I'm just so curious...
[Veyle] 
Curious? About what?
[Citrinne] 
It's so...modest.
[Veyle] 
I... I don't understand.
[Citrinne] 
You're a princess, yet there isn't a single bit of 
jewelry or finery on you.
[Citrinne] 
Your outfit is just so...modest!
[Veyle] 
What does it matter to you? It just... It wasn't 
my fate to have lots of fancy things, I guess.
[Citrinne] 
Of course. I understand.
[Citrinne] 
And yet─oh, how shall I put this... I feel a deep 
need to coax your inner royal out from hiding.
[Veyle] 
I'm sorry if my...plainness...bothers you.
[Citrinne] 
Oh my. I apologize, Lady Veyle. I hope you 
know that I meant no offense.
[Citrinne] 
Just rest easy and leave everything to me.
[Veyle] 
Leave everything... Wait, what do you mean?
[Citrinne] 
Let's see... I suppose it would be wise to start 
with the base garments.
[Citrinne] 
Oh, but a person's style is directly influenced 
by their lifestyle, so perhaps... Hmm...
[Citrinne] 

[Veyle] 
What does that mean? Aw, I'm not sure I want 
to find out.

[Veyle] 
I can't believe how many rare gems have been 
stitched into this dress. It's so sparkly.
[Citrinne] 
Are you pleased with your new attire, 
Lady Veyle?
[Veyle] 
MY attire? Oh, I can't possibly keep this. 
It's way too valuable.
[Citrinne] 
Oh? Really? I was sure it would suit you...
[Veyle] 
And why did you hand me this deed saying I 
own "a deserted island with beautiful beaches"?
[Citrinne] 
It also says, "private villa included." A pretty 
dress deserves a pretty escape, don't you think?
[Veyle] 
I suppose... But I can't accept a deserted island 
or a gem-covered dress.
[Citrinne] 
Perhaps just this crown then? I had it custom 
made for you, Lady Veyle.
[Veyle] 
Oh, it's so beautiful!
[Veyle] 
Wait, no! I can't! I don't need this!
[Citrinne] 
But... But... Oh, won't you please accept just 
one of these things?
[Citrinne] 
For my sake?
[Veyle] 
For your sake? What do you mean?
[Veyle] 
Oh.
[Veyle] 
I understand.
[Veyle] 
This isn't a gift─it's an offering.
[Veyle] 
It's like when the worshippers from Elusia kept 
giving me all those fancy offerings...
[Veyle] 
Hoping their wishes and prayers would 
be granted.
[Citrinne] 
Really? Oh my.
[Veyle] 
Well, I won't accept anything from you, Citrinne.
[Veyle] 
It's unfortunate, really.
[Veyle] 
All I wanted was for us to be friends.
[Veyle] 

[Citrinne] 
Oh, dear... Lady Veyle...

[Citrinne] 
Lady Veyle? May I have a moment?
[Veyle] 
I suppose.
[Citrinne] 
I need you to know...I only wanted to be friends 
with you. Truly.
[Citrinne] 
But it seems as if my actions have made a mess 
of things. I apologize for that.
[Veyle] 
...
[Veyle] 
Before I accept your apology, I have to 
ask something.
[Veyle] 
What did you mean when you said you wanted 
me to accept the gifts for your sake?
[Citrinne] 
I just wanted to see my favorite thing...
[Citrinne] 
The smile on a friend's face.
[Veyle] 
You...wanted to see me smile?
[Citrinne] 
Yes. That's why I asked you to accept them for 
my sake.
[Veyle] 
The dress, the island, the crown...they weren't 
offerings? They were gifts...for me.
[Citrinne] 
I promise. I meant them as gifts, that's all.
[Citrinne] 
I thought it might make you smile to receive 
presents worthy of a princess.
[Veyle] 
I'm so sorry, Citrinne. I completely 
misunderstood your intentions.
[Veyle] 
I hope it's not too late...
[Citrinne] 
No, not at all! I still have the deed to that island. 
Let me just─
[Veyle] 
Oh, no! That's not what I meant! I don't need 
expensive presents.
[Veyle] 
I meant, I hope it's not too late to be friends. 
I hope maybe we could start...now?
[Citrinne] 
Of course...
[Citrinne] 
Of course we can, Lady Veyle!
[Citrinne] 
I already consider you to be one of my most 
precious friends.
[Veyle] 
Hehe, that makes me so happy, Citrinne.
[Veyle] 
Your friendship really is the most wonderful 
gift you could ever give me.
