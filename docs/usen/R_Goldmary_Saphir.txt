[Goldmary] 
Hello, Saphir.
[Goldmary] 
I heard you're good with fish. Is that true?
[Saphir] 
Yep. You heard right.
[Saphir] 
Been fishing ever since my dad first took me out 
on the water. Been cooking 'em about as long.
[Saphir] 
If it's got gills or flippers or tentacles, I can 
cook it to your preference.
[Goldmary] 
I see. Even uncommon ingredients like squid 
or octopus are within your purview, then.
[Saphir] 
They sure are! I once caught this massive thing. 
A real whopper. Don't even know what it was.
[Saphir] 
But that didn't stop us from cutting it up and 
making a huge feast for the whole village.
[Goldmary] 
That is quite a story. You must be exceptionally 
skilled.
[Goldmary] 
That is why I must destroy you utterly.
[Saphir] 
Whoa, hey! Why the hostility?
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, Saphir, but there is only room for one 
perfect chef here.
[Goldmary] 
I challenge you to a singular contest of 
culinary skill.
[Saphir] 
You mean, like...a cook-off?
[Goldmary] 
That's right. We'll showcase our talents and let 
others decide which of us is superior.
[Saphir] 
Sure, I guess this might as well happen.
[Goldmary] 
Good. I will tell you when and where as soon as 
it is decided. Be ready to cook some seafood.
[Goldmary] 
And look forward to being ground into dust 
and used for seasoning.

[Saphir] 
Here we are. Ready to cook some fish?
[Goldmary] 
Well...
[Goldmary] 
Not exactly.
[Saphir] 
Hey, what's wrong? I thought you were 
gonna grind me to dust.
[Goldmary] 
Ashamed as I am to admit it...I wasn't able to 
get my hands on any decent fish.
[Saphir] 
No? That's a shame. Look what I caught─as 
rare a specimen as you'll find in these parts.
[Goldmary] 
The competition hasn't even started, and I've 
already lost.
[Saphir] 
Not at all. Look, I caught one for you too.
[Goldmary] 
Why would you do that?
[Saphir] 
Wouldn't be fair otherwise. It's a cook-off, 
not a fishing contest.
[Goldmary] 
That's true...
[Goldmary] 
Thank you, Saphir. This is a noble gesture. 
I'm humbled by your kindness.
[Goldmary] 
But as much as I want to win this competition, 
I can't let you outshine me in nobility either.
[Goldmary] 
So...please take this.
[Saphir] 
What have we got here?
[Goldmary] 
Rare herbs. They were hard to come by, but it 
would be poor form not to share them now.
[Saphir] 
You weren't kidding─these are tough to find! 
Hehe, thanks, Goldmary. You're all right.
[Saphir] 
Now, let's get cooking! May the best chef win.
[Goldmary] 
Agreed. You're going down.

[Goldmary] 
The cook-off was a delight, Saphir. I'm... I'm 
actually proud to say we were evenly matched.
[Saphir] 
Yeah, it was great. Can't complain about a tie 
with a skilled chef like you.
[Saphir] 
Tight as the competition was, though...that 
wasn't the best part.
[Saphir] 
That honor goes to all the smiling faces 
we got to feed.
[Goldmary] 
I have to agree.
[Goldmary] 
The crowd seemed to be so worn down before 
we got started.
[Goldmary] 
But by the time we were finished, they were 
completely revitalized.
[Saphir] 
Yeah. We did a good thing.
[Goldmary] 
I have to say, Saphir, the way you handled our 
contest truly moved me.
[Saphir] 
How so?
[Goldmary] 
The only reason I was able to cook at all was 
because you shared your catch with me.
[Goldmary] 
If not for your generosity, I would have been 
a laughingstock.
[Goldmary] 
And even though you could have humiliated me, 
you didn't say another word about it.
[Saphir] 
Hahaha! Are you kidding? I could say the same 
thing about you, y'know.
[Goldmary] 
I don't see how.
[Saphir] 
Those herbs of yours were a key ingredient in 
my dish. I couldn't have made it without 'em.
[Saphir] 
And you didn't say another word about that, 
did you?
[Goldmary] 
Hehe!
[Saphir] 
What's so funny?
[Goldmary] 
It's just very unlike me to refrain from 
saying something.
[Goldmary] 
Normally, I'm the sort of person who would 
take credit for those herbs.
[Goldmary] 
But in this situation... Well, I guess you could 
say I was inspired by your good deed.
[Saphir] 
That's really touching.
[Goldmary] 
I'd love it if we could do this again.
[Goldmary] 
I don't mean as a competition. Let's just cook 
up another feast for people.
[Saphir] 
Sounds great. We should branch out from 
seafood next time too.
[Saphir] 
I'll be in unfamiliar territory, though, so you'll 
have to give me a few pointers.
[Goldmary] 
I'll be happy to teach you a few tricks.
[Goldmary] 
Maybe then you'll be able to say I inspired you 
as well.
