[Panette] 
Hm... Hm Hmmm...
[Ivy] 
Did you need something from me, Panette?
[Panette] 
Ah, no. Why do you ask?
[Ivy] 
You have been staring at me for some time.
[Panette] 
It's just that for a princess, you seem so... 
How to put this? Composed.
[Ivy] 
Do I? It seems like a rather ordinary level of 
composure to me.
[Panette] 
Really? But you are not bursting into song or 
dancing to and fro.
[Ivy] 
Correct. I do not do those things.
[Panette] 
Nor are you running around like a mad wolf or 
cramming prime rib down your gullet.
[Panette] 
You are simply...standing around. It was so odd, 
I could not help but stare.
[Ivy] 
Perhaps you are merely unaccustomed to the 
standard and expected conduct of royalty.
[Panette] 
I have offended you, haven't I? My deepest 
apologies.
[Ivy] 
No─no need for that. I should not be looking 
for offense in others' customs.
[Ivy] 
It's rather nice to speak with you, actually. 
My own retainers lack a certain...femininity.
[Panette] 
Really? I enjoy your company as well.
[Ivy] 
Good. Then, if it's all right with you, I'd like it 
very much if we became friends.
[Panette] 
Of course, Your Highness! It would be 
my honor!

[Ivy] 
Panette... Please explain yourself.
[Panette] 
I promised we were going somewhere special. 
Well...here it is!
[Ivy] 
When I said that I'd like for us to be friends...
[Ivy] 
I did not realize that would entail visits to 
ancient...decayed...ruins?
[Panette] 
Precisely! Doesn't it make your heart quicken?
[Ivy] 
Excessively so, I'm afraid.
[Ivy] 
I feel as if a vengeful ghost could steal upon us 
at any moment.
[Panette] 
I know! It is ever so charming.
[Ivy] 
You find it...charming.
[Ivy] 
Ghosts. You find the idea of ghosts charming.
[Panette] 
Why, of course! I simply adore them!
[Ivy] 
I suppose I ought to thank you.
[Ivy] 
This place is...special to you. For that reason, 
I appreciate your sharing it with me.
[Ivy] 
Unfortunately, people have a wide variety 
of tastes.
[Panette] 
Oh dear. You are not by any chance afraid of 
ghosts, are you?
[Ivy] 
I am, in fact, terrified to the very brink of 
my composure.
[Ivy] 
The stain on the wall like a human silhouette. 
The handprints on the windows. The stale air...
[Ivy] 
It is only by force of will that I remain here. 
Conscious. Not screaming.
[Ivy] 
My dignity hangs by one last thread of decorum. 
The pride I take in my royal office.
[Ivy] 
That thread is...about to snap. Yes, it will snap 
any moment now.
[Ivy] 
Even a princess is only human, after all.
[Ivy] 
So...with that...
[Ivy] 
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE!
[Ivy] 

[Panette] 
Good heavens! Princess Ivy...slow down!

[Panette] 
I cannot tell you how sorry I am for taking 
you to those ruins.
[Ivy] 
Please, don't worry about it.
[Panette] 
I didn't even think to ask if you were afraid 
of ghosts. How horribly careless!
[Panette] 
Please allow me to atone for my error. 
Whatever you need done, I will do.
[Ivy] 
You don't need to atone for anything. I'm fine.
[Ivy] 
I seldom need to go anywhere alone, so I've 
scarcely felt my new crippling fear of solitude.
[Panette] 
What?!
[Ivy] 
The howling wind keeps me awake at night, but 
I've learned to scream myself into exhaustion.
[Ivy] 
And so what if the creak of a floorboard renders 
me motionless for hours on end? I don't mind.
[Ivy] 
I have accepted that the lifetime of fear I went 
through in a single day has scarred me forever.
[Panette] 
Oh, you poor woman! I am so very sorry!
[Ivy] 
Hahaha!
[Ivy] 
No, I'm sorry. I had to tease you a little.
[Ivy] 
I'm fine, Panette. Really.
[Ivy] 
I understand that you brought me to that place 
because you thought it would make me happy.
[Ivy] 
Please don't worry about it ever again.
[Panette] 
Don't worry about it?! I put you through a 
terrible ordeal!
[Ivy] 
Your intention was purely for me to enjoy it, 
was it not?
[Panette] 
Well, yes, but─
[Ivy] 
That is what matters to me. Thank you.
[Panette] 
Oh... All right. If you are certain.
[Panette] 
Do you think, despite this horrible blunder, 
we might still be friends?
[Ivy] 
Of course!
[Ivy] 
So long as you tell me where we're going ahead 
of time from now on.
[Ivy] 
And no more haunted places, please.
[Panette] 
Hehehe, of course! From now on, 
we stay in the land of the living!
