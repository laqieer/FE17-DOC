[Alcryst] 
Divine One, watch out! There's a wolf!
[Alear] 
What? Where?!
[Alcryst] 
Mr. Wolf! Please go away! Leave the Divine 
Dragon alone─I beg you!
[Alcryst] 
Ugh... It isn't listening to me... No choice. 
I'll have to get serious.
[Alear] 
That pose! Is he about to...bow in apology like 
the incident at the border?!
[Alcryst] 
Mr. Wolf! I'm so, so sorry!
[Alcryst] 
I'm sure that my apologies will enrage you 
further─to the point you might devour me!
[Alcryst] 
And if I wind up in your stomach, my allies may 
waste days looking for me, but I must persist!
[Alcryst] 
Please, though I have no right to make this 
request, I ask you to go home! I'm begging you!
[Alear] 
The wolf is actually turning away... Incredible.
[Alcryst] 
There it goes...
[Alcryst] 
Thank goodness you're all right, Divine One.
[Alear] 
Thank you, Alcryst. I'm glad you're OK too. 
That was a risky move...
[Alcryst] 
Think nothing of it. Your life is worth far more 
than mine, so I just did what needed to be done.
[Alear] 
Uh, no. My life, your life, everyone's lives... 
None of us are above anyone else.
[Alcryst] 
Ah. You're right, Divine One... Looks like I've 
fallen short yet again.
[Alcryst] 
The Divine Dragon's radiance should lighten my 
mood, but I've managed to darken it instead...
[Alcryst] 
I sincerely apologize─I should leave.
[Alear] 
What? Alcryst! Wait!
[Alear] 
Wow. He's so fast...

[Alear] 
Alcryst? Do you have a moment?
[Alcryst] 
I do, Divine One. What is it?
[Alear] 
Why are you standing like that? Are you OK?
[Alcryst] 
I'm preparing to bow.
[Alear] 
And...why are you doing that?
[Alcryst] 
I want to be ready in case I need to apologize 
for something.
[Alear] 
Oh, for the love of─ There's no need for that! 
I just wanted to discuss that wolf incident.
[Alcryst] 
Oh? What about it?
[Alear] 
I need you to understand something about me 
and about you. I'm not higher. You're not lower.
[Alear] 
We share the same footing. Try not to think or 
act otherwise, OK?
[Alcryst] 
I wish I could follow that order, but...I just don't 
believe it.
[Alear] 
Hey, come on... Why is it so hard for you to 
accept that?
[Alcryst] 
I'm very sorry to disappoint you, Divine One.
[Alear] 
I guess it can't be helped. I worry, but you do 
get results. Keep handling things your own way.
[Alcryst] 
My own way? Are you sure?
[Alcryst] 
I'm aware that I often bring the mood down 
around others, and I struggle with compliments.
[Alcryst] 
I'm nowhere near as confident as my brother, 
so I'm sure my hesitation frustrates people.
[Alcryst] 
Despite all of that...you really think it's OK for 
me to keep handling things...my own way?
[Alear] 
I do.
[Alear] 
But I hope that, someday, you'll take what I've 
been saying to heart.
[Alcryst] 
Very well. Thank you for your advice, 
Divine One...

[Alear] 
Alcryst! There's another wolf!
[Alear] 
It's heading toward you! Look out!
[Alcryst] 
Yes. I see it.
[Alear] 
Why are you standing still?! We need to get 
to safety!
[Alcryst] 
It's OK, Divine One. I can handle this.
[Alcryst] 
Smell that, boy? I brought some jerky with me. 
Come on, eat up...
[Alear] 
I don't believe it. Alcryst just tamed that wolf!
[Alcryst] 
This is the same wolf that almost attacked you 
before, Divine One.
[Alcryst] 
You'd better head back up the mountain now. 
Stay safe out there, OK?
[Alear] 
When did you two become friends?
[Alcryst] 
I've been coming here to practice my archery. 
He keeps showing up to watch.
[Alcryst] 
We were pretty tense around each other at first, 
but then I remembered your advice.
[Alear] 
Which advice was that?
[Alcryst] 
You said I should handle things my own way. 
I didn't want to attack the wolf, so I relaxed.
[Alcryst] 
He must have sensed that because he relaxed 
in kind. Now it's like we're friends.
[Alear] 
Alcryst! That's amazing!
[Alcryst] 
Thank you. It was all because of your guidance.
[Alcryst] 
Oh! What am I doing?! I'm thanking the Divine 
Dragon in such an informal manner! I should─
[Alear] 
Please, Alcryst, no more throwing yourself 
at my feet.
[Alcryst] 
Huh?
[Alear] 
Don't be upset. Your apologies are impressive, 
but you could stand to, well, stand more often.
[Alear] 
If you really want to thank me, that wolf did 
look awfully friendly toward you...
[Alear] 
Could you help me win him over?
[Alcryst] 
That should be easy. Just bring some jerky next 
time. Then we can all play together.
[Alear] 
I'll do just that! Can't wait. Thank you, Alcryst.

[Alcryst] 
Uh, excuse me...Divine One?
[Alear] 
Alcryst? What is it?
[Alcryst] 
Uh... Well, you see...
[Alear] 
You stopped yourself from bowing! Very nice 
recovery, Alcryst.
[Alcryst] 
Yes. I must try to stand tall.
[Alcryst] 
Please, Divine One, have a look at this.
[Alear] 
Oh! What a beautiful gemstone! It has such a 
mysterious color.
[Alcryst] 
It's a stone of Brodian origin. The coloring is 
quite rare, with red and blue mixed together...
[Alcryst] 
My father gave it to me when I was born. 
He liked how it matched my features.
[Alear] 
Ah, I see! This is a match for your blue hair and 
red eyes, isn't it? This gem suits you perfectly.
[Alcryst] 
B-but...your features are even more of a match, 
Divine One. The color distribution differs, but...
[Alcryst] 
It reminds me of you. I see someone I treasure 
who encouraged me to do things my own way.
[Alear] 
Wow. Someone you treasure, huh?
[Alcryst] 
My father told me to choose an important 
person to give this to someday. So...
[Alcryst] 
Divine One... Please accept this as a token of... 
well, a token of my feelings toward you.
[Alear] 
...
[Alear] 
Thank you, Alcryst. I gladly accept your token.
[Alcryst] 
...
[Alear] 
Now it's my turn. I'd like to give you this ring.
[Alcryst] 
This is the Pact Ring...
[Alear] 
It is. And now it's yours.
[Alear] 
Prince Alcryst... I, the Divine Dragon, grant you 
this, a symbol of our special bond.
[Alear] 
Let's share our lives as fellow soldiers...and 
partners in peace.
[Alcryst] 
C-coo...
[Alear] 
I'm sorry, did you just...coo?
[Alcryst] 
Cool! Astoundingly cool! Impossibly cool! 
I can't believe this!
[Alcryst] 
I thought I stuck the landing for sure, but then 
you outshined me with an even grander gesture!
[Alcryst] 
And I don't even mind! This makes me so 
happy. Th-thank you, Divine One...
[Alear] 
Oh, Alcryst, please don't cry!
[Alcryst] 
I won't. I promise. I'll do my best to stand tall 
for you─and for myself.
[Alcryst] 
Or, uh...taller than before, at least.
[Alear] 
I suppose that's a start.
[Alcryst] 
And I will get stronger! Despite how I seem, 
I am a prince of Brodia...
[Alcryst] 
As a son of the kingdom of warriors, I will 
become someone you can rely on...
[Alcryst] 
And I pledge to always protect you, 
Divine Dragon .
[Alear] 
Thoughtful as ever, Alcryst.
[Alcryst] 
I can say all of this with the utmost confidence. 
In fact, I swear it upon this ring.
[Alear] 
I believe you, Alcryst. Thank you.
[Alcryst] 
I will stand beside you proudly and be the best 
prince I can be, to the very end.
