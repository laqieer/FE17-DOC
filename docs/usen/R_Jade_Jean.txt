[Jade] 
Hello, Jean.
[Jean] 
Ah! Jade?!
[Jade] 
Sorry, did I startle you? You look so scared...
[Jean] 
Not at all! My heart is beating the 
normal amount.
[Jade] 
Hmm...
[Jean] 
So, if you don't need me for anything, I'll just 
be going now.
[Jade] 
You are scared. Is it me?
[Jade] 
Am I frightening you somehow? I'm not trying 
to be scary...
[Jean] 
...
[Jean] 
I'm not scared. Really. I just...have a hard time 
around you.
[Jade] 
Around...me?
[Jean] 
Um, yes. Monsters I can deal with.
[Jean] 
Cramped spaces, the dark, bugs, wild animals─ 
none of that stuff is scary to me.
[Jean] 
You...on the other hand...
[Jade] 
What are you getting at, Jean?
[Jean] 
People like you... It's hard for me to... I'm sorry!
[Jean] 

[Jade] 
There he goes.
[Jade] 
I wonder what he meant by "people like you"...

[Jean] 
Jade...I'm really sorry about before.
[Jade] 
For saying that it's hard to be near me?
[Jade] 
Don't worry, Jean. No apology necessary, but 
I would like an explanation.
[Jade] 
Why do you have a hard time around "people 
like me"? What does that mean?
[Jean] 
Well...
[Jean] 
People say that...you're cold─almost inhuman─ 
on the battlefield.
[Jade] 
I suppose that's not...always untrue.
[Jean] 
Then is it true that you never hesitate to rush 
right into battle?
[Jade] 
Ah. Guilty as charged.
[Jade] 
Thank you. That's all I needed to hear. 
I understand now.
[Jean] 
You do?
[Jade] 
You were living a relatively peaceful life until 
you joined our ranks, right?
[Jade] 
I can see why soldiers with bloody pasts and 
bloodier weapons might make you anxious.
[Jean] 
U-um, wait, no. That's─ That's not what I...
[Jade] 
It's OK, Jean. I'm not judging you.
[Jade] 
I really do understand. I'll give you some space.
[Jade] 
...
[Jade] 
Sorry again for causing discomfort.
[Jade] 
[Jean] 
Jade, wait!

[Jean] 
Jade!
[Jade] 
Yes, Jean?
[Jean] 
You had it all wrong! I'm not scared of you!
[Jade] 
But you said it was hard to be around me...
[Jean] 
I did, but I wasn't finished...
[Jean] 
I know that the reason you rush into battle isn't 
because you're bloodthirsty. It's to protect us.
[Jean] 
But either way, it always puts you on the 
front lines.
[Jean] 
So when it's over, you come home hurt worse 
than anyone else. Am I right?
[Jade] 
Oh...
[Jean] 
I worry about you. I get so worried sometimes 
I can hardly stand it.
[Jade] 
Oh, Jean...
[Jean] 
People who throw themselves into combat like 
you don't tend to live very long.
[Jean] 
That's what makes you hard to be around─the 
idea that one day you might not be there...
[Jade] 
...
[Jean] 
But...I think I've gotten over that.
[Jean] 
However injured you get, I can always heal you.
[Jean] 
You fight so hard to protect me, so I should do 
my part to keep you alive too.
[Jade] 
That's very noble of you.
[Jean] 
I'm really sorry for the way I acted before.
[Jean] 
From now on...
[Jade] 
From now on, we'll fight side by side...as allies 
and friends.
[Jean] 
Yes. That's exactly right, Jade.
[Jean] 
I'm really glad we've got that straightened out.
