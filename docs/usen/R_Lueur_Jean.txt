=== Alear & Jean ===

[Alear]
Jean? Are you not getting enough greens
at the café?
[Jean]
Oh, no, I'm actually picking medicinal
herbs. See?
[Alear]
Wow, you've got a ton picked already.
[Jean]
This one acts as a painkiller, and this one is
useful in several ointments.
[Jean]
It used to grow all over my home island, but it's
gotten harder to find lately.
[Jean]
So I'm picking some here to send back to
my father.
[Alear]
For the clinic on your island, right?
[Alear]
This is a lot for one person to harvest alone.
Let me help you.
[Jean]
No, no, no, that's OK! You must have a lot of
other important things to do, Divine One.
[Alear]
Not so many that I can't lend a hand here.
[Alear]
Besides, with the war and your studies, I bet
you're so busy, you barely have time to sleep.
[Jean]
Hm-hm, I should've known the Divine One
would see right through me.
[Alear]
That's right. Nothing gets by me.
[Jean]
If you really wouldn't mind, then yes, it would
be a big help. Thank you!

[Alear]
Picking herbs again today, I see.
[Jean]
This one really makes a difference in treating
all kinds of illnesses and injuries back home.
[Jean]
I used to go out all the time with my father
to harvest these.
[Alear]
I didn't get to talk much with your father on
the island. What's he like?
[Jean]
Whenever I succeed, in studies or in helping out,
he praises me like a well-behaved puppy.
[Jean]
But when I mess up, he gets very upset, like
he's scolding a misbehaving puppy.
[Alear]
So you're a puppy either way, huh?
[Jean]
Haha, now that you mention it...
[Jean]
He was the kind of dad where some days we
got along, and some days I hated him.
[Jean]
But in his absence, I appreciate him more.
Same with my mother.
[Jean]
I didn't realize it when I saw them every day,
but I have a lot of respect for my parents.
[Jean]
I think the only reason I work so hard now is
because of the way they raised me.
[Alear]
Jean...that's so beautiful...
[Jean]
Huh?! Are you crying?!
[Alear]
That story about your family was just...
very touching.
[Jean]
Thank you, Divine One.
[Jean]
Here, take this poultice. It's good for swelling
around the eyes.
[Alear]
Haha, thanks, Jean. I needed that.

[Alear]
I have something for you, Jean.
[Jean]
Medicinal herbs? Oh! This is quite a lot.
[Alear]
I found a place full of them in the forest, so I
picked as many as I could.
[Jean]
Wow...thank you so much. This is going to make
a big difference back home.
[Alear]
What you said about your parents really struck
me. I want to help your family as much as I can.
[Jean]
Thanks, Divine One.
[Jean]
Hey, what happened to your arm? It's all
scratched up.
[Alear]
Oh, right after I found the patch of herbs,
I slipped and tumbled down a hill.
[Jean]
Oh no! Here, sit down, and I'll treat it right now.
[Alear]
It doesn't really bother me.
[Jean]
Please, Divine One. I'd hate for your wounds to
stay open and get infected.
[Alear]
All right. Go ahead, then.
[Jean]
Let's see here...
[Jean]
You know, Divine One, I think it was good that
I left the island to travel with you.
[Alear]
Yeah?
[Jean]
You're a very generous person, but you don't
know how to be generous to yourself.
[Jean]
As long as I'm around, no matter how little care
you have for your well-being, you'll be fine.
[Jean]
I want to pay you back a hundred times over
for all the kindness you've shown me.
[Alear]
Wow.
[Jean]
There. All treated. It should heal quickly now.
[Alear]
Thanks! And I'm glad to have you along too.

[Alear]
We pulled up a pretty big haul today.
[Jean]
Mostly thanks to you. You're not tired from
working so hard?
[Alear]
Having you along made it fun. I feel like I could
keep going for hours.
[Jean]
Uh-oh. Looks like you're hurt again.
[Alear]
Huh? Oh, no. That's from the last battle.
I stepped in to protect an ally.
[Alear]
I had it healed right afterward, but I guess it still
left a mark.
[Jean]
You should try this. It's an ointment I made
from the herbs we picked last time.
[Jean]
If you smear it on, it should keep the redness
down. You'll have to wait a bit for it to dry.
[Alear]
Thank you.
[Jean]
If you're ever hurt...or even just in trouble,
I hope you know you can count on me.
[Jean]
I want you to be able to count on me the way
so many others are counting on you.
[Alear]
But, Jean, don't you know?
[Alear]
I already do.
[Jean]
You─ You do?
[Alear]
Of everyone in the army, you're somebody
I know I can always rely on.
[Alear]
In fact, I've been thinking you deserve to have
this Pact Ring I've been carrying.
[Jean]
I don't know... Something that precious should
go to someone worthier.
[Alear]
I can't think of anyone worthier than you.
You've always been there for me, after all.
[Jean]
Well... I guess that makes sense.
[Jean]
Thank you. From now on, you can consider
me your personal physician!
[Alear]
I wouldn't have it any other way.
[Jean]
But if that's how it's going to be, I've got a lot
of reading and practice to get to.
[Jean]
The Divine One's personal physician had better
not make any mistakes!
[Alear]
Take your time. Once this war is over, I should
have a lot fewer injuries to patch up.
[Jean]
True. Um, ...
[Jean]
Thanks for believing in me. I'll work hard to
become a doctor worthy of treating you.
