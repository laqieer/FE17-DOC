[Ivy] 
Did you need something from me, 
Prince Alcryst?
[Alcryst] 
Hm.
[Ivy] 
I see. You are pretending to ignore me.
[Alcryst] 
I still refuse to forgive you. You know why.
[Alcryst] 
How else should I behave in the presence of 
someone who helped to murder my father?
[Ivy] 
...
[Ivy] 
I apologize for my part in your father's death.
[Alcryst] 
Y-you do?!
[Ivy] 
I know an apology can't heal your wounds, or... 
really achieve much at all.
[Ivy] 
But we are now allies.
[Ivy] 
I think it's important we find what common 
ground we can and meet each other halfway.
[Alcryst] 
Uh...
[Ivy] 
That is why I'm taking this crucial first step.
[Ivy] 
I am truly sorry about your father.
[Alcryst] 
Princess Ivy, I...
[Alcryst] 
I used to fear your family and your country. 
I never dreamed we'd end up on the same side.
[Alcryst] 
Life is so unpredictable...
[Alcryst] 
It pushes us forward, ready or not. Holding on 
to past prejudices will only trip us up.
[Alcryst] 
From now on, I promise to do my best to find 
that common ground you mentioned.
[Ivy] 
Thank you. But you should know that staring 
is rude.
[Alcryst] 
Ah! You're right! I apologize for being so 
careless. I won't let it happen again.
[Alcryst] 

[Ivy] 
At least we're looking in the same direction. 
Perhaps better times lie ahead...

[Alcryst] 
Princess Ivy? Are you...glaring at me?
[Ivy] 
No, Prince Alcryst. At least not intentionally.
[Ivy] 
But I can't take my eyes off of your armor.
[Ivy] 
In Elusia we are taught from an early age to 
keep watch for Brodian armor.
[Alcryst] 
Ooh. I think I understand...
[Alcryst] 
Brodia has invaded Elusia more times than I can 
count. My country has a lot to answer for.
[Alcryst] 
For what it's worth...I am sorry.
[Ivy] 
Oh? And what do you mean by that, exactly?
[Alcryst] 
Huh? I, uh, wha─
[Ivy] 
Did you just issue a formal apology from the 
kingdom of Brodia for its invasions of our land?
[Ivy] 
Are you admitting fault on behalf of your people 
and swearing to adopt peaceful foreign policy?
[Ivy] 
Reconciliation between nations is a serious 
matter, not to be taken lightly.
[Alcryst] 
Th-that's not what I─
[Alcryst] 
What I meant to say was, uh, if Brodia is at 
fault then we absolutely should apologize.
[Alcryst] 
But that apology is not mine to give! The king 
and nobility would have to convene and agree...
[Alcryst] 
So when I said I was sorry, it came from me as 
an individual, not as a representative of...uh...
[Ivy] 
Heh heh, I know that. I'm sorry─you are a little 
too easy to toy with.
[Alcryst] 
Oh, Princess Ivy... I was so nervous.
[Ivy] 
My ill feelings toward Brodia are in the past, 
but I could not resist teasing you a little.
[Ivy] 
Look on the bright side─we are comfortable 
enough now to joke with one another. Right?
[Alcryst] 
Y-yes, of course! I did think my heart was going 
to stop, but I suppose it was...funny...

[Alcryst] 
Pardon me, Princess Ivy?
[Alcryst] 
In our last conversation, you made it clear that 
you still harbor resentment toward Brodia.
[Ivy] 
Yes. I did.
[Alcryst] 
Well, at the risk of overstepping my boundaries, 
I hope you'll allow me to say one thing.
[Alcryst] 
The relationship between Brodia and Elusia has 
never been civil─certainly not in my lifetime.
[Alcryst] 
But as you've mentioned, we are now allies... 
We work together.
[Ivy] 
That's true.
[Alcryst] 
This alliance was as unpredictable as it 
is wonderful.
[Alcryst] 
I will work hard to ensure that our countries 
become allies when this conflict is over.
[Alcryst] 
I may not be able to do as much as my brother, 
the crown prince, but...
[Alcryst] 
Well, I thought I owed you a clear statement of 
my own intentions at the very least.
[Ivy] 
...
[Ivy] 
My first impression of you was that you were 
weak-willed and uncharismatic.
[Ivy] 
I feel differently now.
[Alcryst] 
You do?
[Ivy] 
When it matters, you speak your mind. And 
what you say is kind and thoughtful.
[Ivy] 
These are qualities I consider princely.
[Alcryst] 
Oh, no, please don't think too highly of me. 
You're much more regal and capable than─
[Ivy] 
Are you suggesting that I, crown princess of my 
kingdom, am not a good judge of character?
[Alcryst] 
N-not at all! I would never, ever...
[Alcryst] 
Ah. Another joke?
[Ivy] 
Very good. You're catching on.
[Alcryst] 
Haha, I take it as a sign that our relationship 
is improving.
[Ivy] 
Agreed. I hope our friendship continues to grow.
[Ivy] 
In honor of our fathers...and for the future of 
our kingdoms.
[Alcryst] 
Yes. Here's to a better future!
