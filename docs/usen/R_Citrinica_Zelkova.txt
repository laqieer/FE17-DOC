[Zelkov] 
Done... It's done. Curses, what do I do now? 
How do I go on *living*?
[Citrinne] 1 

[Citrinne] 
Is something wrong, Zelkov? I can lend an ear, 
if you wish to discuss whatever it is.
[Zelkov] 
That is very kind of you. But I doubt you would 
truly *understand.*
[Citrinne] 
Try me.
[Zelkov] 
...
[Zelkov] 
One of my *pursuits*...has come to an end.
[Citrinne] 
Oh. You're broken up over a...hobby? I assumed 
it was something more serious.
[Zelkov] 
The word "hobby" is insufficient to describe 
what is absolutely *paramount* to me.
[Citrinne] 
I... I see. Apologies. Please, go on.
[Zelkov] 
I had been *nurturing* a young bird.
[Zelkov] 
Her parents had *abandoned* her. She had not 
yet learned to fly.
[Zelkov] 
I took it upon myself to *care* for her. In doing 
so, I became something of a foster parent.
[Citrinne] 
Aww, how adorable.
[Zelkov] 
It is done, now. She has gone.
[Citrinne] 
She escaped?
[Zelkov] 
She has left the nest. Taken her *rightful* place 
among the clouds.
[Citrinne] 
Pardon me, but...isn't that a good thing?
[Zelkov] 
Yes. It was my *intention* from the start.
[Zelkov] 
Indeed, as an instructor, I am *proud* to see her 
fly away all on her own.
[Zelkov] 
But as a father, I am *consumed* by loss.
[Zelkov] 
Do you understand my problem now, Citrinne? 
Do you have a *solution* for me?
[Citrinne] 
Hmm... I could purchase a similar-looking bird 
for you to care for. Or hire a search party.
[Zelkov] 
No, *that* won't do...
[Citrinne] 
In that case, there likely isn't much I can do.
[Zelkov] 
I understand. In that case, I will take up no more 
of your time. This will be my *burden* to bear.
[Citrinne] 
I'm sorry, Zelkov. I wish there was something 
I could do to help.

[Citrinne] 
Zelkov, how have you been?
[Zelkov] 
Despite attempts to drown it in other pursuits... 
my loss continues to *consume* me.
[Citrinne] 
Ah... That's too bad.
[Citrinne] 
I'm sorry to impose while you're feeling blue, 
but could you help me with something?
[Zelkov] 
What do you *require*?
[Citrinne] 
This. Give it a read.
[Zelkov] 
"My son is a layabout. How do I convince him to 
put in some work?"
[Zelkov] 
"They say I need to cheer up, but they don't 
get it. My love's left me. How can I move on?"
[Zelkov] 
What *exactly* am I reading?
[Citrinne] 
A register of young Brodians who need help. 
Letters from them or from their parents.
[Zelkov] 
Why show this to *me*?
[Citrinne] 
Sometimes to assist the royal family, I give 
counsel to those who are struggling.
[Citrinne] 
There seem to be...rather a lot this time. 
I could use your assistance.
[Zelkov] 
Citrinne... Your *compassion* is extraordinary.
[Citrinne] 
Huh?
[Zelkov] 
Providing *counsel* to these people could be 
the pursuit that helps me move past my loss.
[Zelkov] 
That *was* your intention, was it not?
[Citrinne] 
Haha, you're giving me too much credit. 
I wasn't thinking that far ahead.
[Citrinne] 
Anyway, how about you pick a person you 
think you can help and write them a letter?
[Citrinne] 
They could benefit from an adult's guidance.
[Zelkov] 
...
[Zelkov] 
Yes. Yes, of course. I will *begin* immediately.

[Citrinne] 
Zelkov! I can hardly believe it!
[Citrinne] 
Did you really send advice to every single 
person on that list?
[Zelkov] 
Yes, I *did.* It was no trouble.
[Citrinne] 
Good work. They were all quite grateful.
[Zelkov] 
That is wonderful to hear...even if the errand 
failed to rid me of my *grief.*
[Citrinne] 
Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that.
[Zelkov] 
However, I have been feeling somewhat more 
*optimistic* of late.
[Citrinne] 
Truly?
[Zelkov] 
Something *occurred* to me while I was giving 
counsel to these troubled individuals.
[Zelkov] 
I realized they were, in their own way, each like 
a *bird* still learning to fly.
[Zelkov] 
My advice was focused on helping them manage 
on their own. To learn to *leave* the nest.
[Zelkov] 
Just like my *little* one.
[Zelkov] 
...
[Zelkov] 
It was helpful to *consider* that while writing.
[Citrinne] 
I see.
[Zelkov] 
I am *grateful* to you, Citrinne.
[Citrinne] 
Whatever do you mean? It was you who did 
me a favor!
[Zelkov] 
You asked for my help, *knowing* that it would 
assist me in turn.
[Citrinne] 
Haha, I'm sure I don't know what you're 
talking about.
[Zelkov] 
Heh, you are a wonderful person. Truly.
[Zelkov] 
Now then. I shall take my leave of you. It is time 
I began *searching* for my next pursuit.
[Citrinne] 
I know it will be lovely, whatever it is.
[Zelkov] 
Thank you.
[Zelkov] 
One last thing, *before* I go.
[Citrinne] 
Oh? What's that?
[Zelkov] 
Let us continue to pursue this friendship. It has 
become *important* to me.
[Citrinne] 
Haha, worry not, Zelkov. I have no plans to fly 
away on you.
