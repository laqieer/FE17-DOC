Ngh, you still haven't found her?!
[Barbarian] [Martial Monk] 中央
Sorry, boss! The thief was too quick for us.
We lost track of where she went!
[Barbarian] お頭
We're supposed to be the thieves, you bums!
We steal─we don't get stolen from!
[Barbarian] お頭
Well, she can't have left this fortress yet.
Go catch her! No excuses!
[Barbarian] [Martial Monk] 中央
Yes, boss!
$蛮族 [Axe Armor] 中央
Boss! Bad news!
[Barbarian] お頭
Am I about to hear an excuse?!
$蛮族 [Axe Armor] 中央
There's a tough-looking bunch headed right
for us. They're armed too!
[Barbarian] お頭
Typical. How much worse can today get?
[Barbarian] お頭
Whatever, this won't stop us either. Battle
squads, in position and ready to move!
[Barbarian] お頭
I want our thieves in the treasury now. Once
the treasure is secure, get to a safe place.
[Barbarian] [Martial Monk] 中央
Got it, boss!

[Anna]
Ooo! A whole room full of treasure! I'm sure no
one will mind if I help myself.
[Anna]
Hey, is someone talking? Sounds panicked,
whoever they are.
[Barbarian] * [Barbarian] [Barbarian] [Archer]
Move your butts and get in position!
[Anna]
Is there about to be a fight? I'd better find
someplace to hide!

[Anna]
I guess this is my best option...

Can you believe the luck we're having today?

[Barbarian] [Martial Monk] 中央
Less talking, more stalking. Make sure your
gear is ready before things kick off!

[Anna]
Uh-oh. This is way too many bandits to make
a clean getaway.


[Alear]
Hmm... The townsfolk told us about a bandit
base, and I'd say we've found it.
[Alear]
I feel sorry for all those poor villagers who had
their valuables stolen.
[Alear]
Precious keepsakes, family heirlooms... Let's
see if we can put them back in the right hands.
[Alear]
Though it looks like we're in for a fight before
that can happen.

[Alear]
Here's hoping the local authorities will keep
these bandits from causing any more trouble.


[Anna]
You guys are really strong, huh? Do you have
room on your team for me?


[Alear]
You want to join us? I should warn you, our
battles will be much more grueling than that.
[Alear]
You'd be placing yourself in danger.
[Anna]
I know I'm small, but I pack a punch! I can take
care of myself, guaranteed.
[Anna]
Besides, I've got nothing better to do. Not until
I figure out where my family went.
[Alear]
You lost your family...
[Anna]
It gets lonely on the road. Maybe if I travel with
you folks, our paths will cross someday.
[Alear]
Well, if that's what you want, I have
no objections.
[Alear]
I'm , the Divine Dragon.
Looking forward to working with you.
[Anna]
Hang on, what?! You're the Divine Dragon?!
My sales...they're gonna go through the roof!
[Anna]
Oh, and the name's Anna. But you can call me
Lady Anna. Pleasure to be in business with you!



[Alear]
I just wish we could have protected the girl.
[Alear]
What was a little girl doing in a bandit's fortress
in the first place?
[Alear]
I suppose we'll never get the chance to ask.

[Barbarian] $ [Barbarian] [Barbarian] [Thief]
Hm? Did that treasure chest just...move?
So that's where the thief went!
[Anna]
Ah! I've been found out!
[Barbarian] [Thief]
It won't open... Hey, thief! Let go of the lid!
Don't make me work up a sweat!

[Anna]
Dang...you found me.

[Anna]
Only one thing to do now if I wanna get out of
this. Time to show my skills!


[Alear]
There was a child in there?! We have to hurry
and rescue her from these bandits!

[Anna]

[Alear]
What's a little girl doing here? This is a bandit
fort. It's no place for children!
[Anna]
But you're not a bandit, right? So why don't
you keep me safe?
[Alear]
Well... I mean, I could, but─
[Anna]
Relax
[Anna]
It's a deal! Thanks a million.
[Anna]
You might not think so, but I'm pretty handy in
a fight. Let me help you help me!



[Anna]
The battle's over, huh? Good thing nobody
ever found me in there.
[Anna]
Now the treasure's mine for the taking!
[Anna]
Relax
[Anna]
Although...those others seem pretty strong.
They really wiped the floor with those bandits.

There's the thief! Get her!
[Anna]
Relax
[Anna]
Hahaha! If you think you're gonna catch me that
easily, think again!

[Barbarian] お頭
Damn you for playing us for fools! You'll never
get your hands on that treasure!

[Barbarian] お頭 b
[Barbarian] お頭
Well, well, well. So the thief turned out to be
just some brat.
[Barbarian] お頭
What do you say, boys? I bet we could get a
pretty penny in ransom out of her parents.
[Anna] Shy
[Anna]
My parents have no idea where I am, so that's
a pretty weak threat if you ask me.
 [Barbarian] お頭 StandBy
[Barbarian] お頭
Yeah, well I didn't ask you! We'll figure that
out later!

I guess...today could get worse after all...


--- DIE ---

[Anna]
Ah, I'd better retreat. Dying will put me out of
business for good...

[Anna]
I guess...it's over for me. Too bad I'll never see
my sisters again...
