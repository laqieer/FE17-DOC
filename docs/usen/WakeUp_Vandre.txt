We decided to take turns waking you from 
your slumber, Divine One.
Today, the duty falls to me.


How soundly you sleep...
I hesitate to wake you needlessly.
Alas, such is my duty as a steward.
Divine One... Ahem, it's best you start 
getting up.


Good morning.
That I might be the one to wake you...
is indeed an honor.


It's good to see you rising so promptly.
A fine morning, is it not?


--- C2 ---

It is I, Vander, 32nd Steward of the Dragon.
Oh...are you resting?


Hmm. What would be the most pleasant 
wake up experience?
Perhaps if I deliver breakfast each morning?


Divine One.
For reference, what manner of food would you 
enjoy upon waking?


Good morning.
As always, I shall endeavor to tend to all 
of your needs.


--- B1 ---

Divine One, please do forgive my intrusion.


You expressed a certain sense of guilt for 
troubling me, but I say...
There is no greater pleasure than to serve.
Ah, forgive me. Perhaps I am pushing my 
service upon you again.


Ah, you are awake?
Well then, I shall take my leave.
Many thanks for your resolute patrol 
of the Somniel.


I see you are finding time to rest.
Excellent choice. Rest focuses the mind.


--- B2 ---

Until such time as you awake...
I shall attend to maintenance of the altar.


Ah, cleaning the altar like this...
It brings back a number of happy memories.
When Queen Lumera would visit...
she would gaze longingly at your 
sleeping face...


Ah, Divine One.
How are you feeling today?
We are having absolutely lovely weather.


Oh my. You are quick to rise today.
I should have arrived sooner...
I beg you to pardon my carelessness.


--- A1 ---

Divine One, we must speak about the 
upcoming battle if─
Ah. I see you are resting.


You have been working tirelessly of late.
Keep pushing yourself and one day...
you will become a magnificent ruler, the same 
as Queen Lumera.


You heard me speaking?
Think nothing of it.
I am, as ever, at your disposal.


I am quite sorry for waking you.
Though you do wake up easier now.
Hm-hm. I must say, it brings a smile to my face.


--- A2 ---

I have arrived slightly earlier than usual. 
How do you fare?


I will be outside knitting until you need me.
I would like to show you what I'm working on, 
but wonder if you'll like it...


I had thought to leave...
but I see I have roused you. Apologies.
By the way, do you happen to like knitting?


Good morning.
Please, take your time rising. I have no wish 
to rush you.


--- S1 ---

Divine One. It is I, Vander.
May I have a quick word with─
Hah, you are sleeping.


I treasure your Pact Ring, Divine One.
In it, I sense the power of Queen Lumera...
and of yourself.
By my oath, I will repay the honor...
that you have bestowed upon me.
I am your steadfast knight, eternally.


You have awakened, Divine One.
I thought perhaps I might chat with you.
I do enjoy our talks so.


Oh? You were only pretending to sleep?
So we're close enough now...
that you engage in mischief?


--- S2 ---

Sorry to disturb you, but it is time to get up.


I suspect, besides the Emblems, it is I who sees 
your sleeping face the most.
The day will come when I will entrust your care 
to the next generation of stewards...
Still, as the 32nd Steward of the Dragon... No...
As Vander...
I pray you find a place in your heart to always 
remember me.


Good morning.
You say you heard something?
Perhaps it was a dream.
Or else the mere ramblings of an old man who 
thinks the world of you.


I am pleased to see you wake so quickly...
as it means we can spend a little time together.
