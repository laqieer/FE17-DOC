=== Boucheron & Lindon ===
--- C ---



[Boucheron]
...
[Lindon]
My, my. What happened here to bring you to
such a state?
[Boucheron]
Oh... I, um, found a book lying around.
[Boucheron]
But when I started reading it, it was so moving
that I...I couldn't hold back the waterworks.
[Lindon]
A tragedy, is it? Tell me more.
[Boucheron]
It's a story of a great sage known only as "L."
[Lindon]
Oh? Tell me more about this "L" fellow.
[Boucheron]
It starts off with L as a young boy who's at the
top of his class at an academy in Elusia.
[Boucheron]
Then, it follows him as he becomes a royal
soldier─even ending up as the prince's retainer.
[Lindon]
Mm-hmm. I'm with you so far.
[Boucheron]
The prince was supposed to ascend the throne,
but it ended up being somebody else instead.
[Boucheron]
The prince left the castle in frustration. L just
stands there stunned as he goes.
[Boucheron]
That was too sad to take, so I don't know what
happens next.
[Lindon]
Oh, you poor thing. Here, dry your eyes.
[Boucheron]
Thank you, sir.
[Boucheron]
You know, lots of books make me cry, but this
one hit me really hard for some reason.
[Boucheron]
Thinking about the prince's bitterness and the
way L felt to see him go...it's just too tragic.
[Lindon]
You've got me invested now. If you keep
reading, do tell me how it turns out.
[Boucheron]
Sure thing, sir.
[Lindon]
And you can keep the handkerchief.

[Lindon]
So, how's that book of yours coming along?
[Lindon]
Oh, but where are my manners? I meant to
give you a treat first.
[Boucheron]
These are some tasty-looking pastries.
[Lindon]
I baked them myself. There's apple filling inside.
[Boucheron]
You bake, Sir Lindon?
[Lindon]
Oh, yes. Nothing bakes a pastry like a good
jolt of thunder magic. Go on, try one.
[Boucheron]
Oh, don't mind if I do.
[Boucheron]
Wow! I had no idea a little zap of lightning
could make such a tasty treat.
[Lindon]
Good, aren't they? Now, back to the subject
of your book.
[Boucheron]
Oh yeah. Last time, the prince L worked for
didn't inherit the throne, so he left the castle.
[Boucheron]
Then, L meets another royal soldier and finds
comfort with her.
[Boucheron]
They get married and begin an ordinary, but
happy, life together.
[Boucheron]
That's as far as I've got for now.
[Lindon]
Fascinating. This story has its hooks in me.
I was a royal soldier once myself, you know.
[Lindon]
I notice you don't seem to be crying
today, though.
[Boucheron]
It's actually pretty tough to hold it in. L's wife
goes through so much for his sake...
[Boucheron]
But I'm embarrassed to be seen crying all the
time, so I'm doing my best to keep it together.
[Lindon]
Heh, don't hold back on my account!
[Lindon]
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Cry as hard as you like. Let it all out!
[Boucheron]
Are...are you sure? Well...if you say so...
[Boucheron]
UWAAAAH!
[Lindon]
Oh my, your nose is running! Here, something
to wipe it with.
[Boucheron]
Thanks again...

[Lindon]
I baked cookies for us, Boucheron! With
thunder, of course, as always. Now, eat up.
[Boucheron]
Oooh, I can't wait. Hey, there's raisins in
these! Yum.
[Lindon]
Read any further in that book yet?
[Boucheron]
I finished it, actually.
[Lindon]
Have you, now? Well then, tell me everything.
[Boucheron]
Sure... After the wedding, L's life was simple
but happy.
[Boucheron]
The couple went through hard times, but they
did it together, and saw their children grow up.
[Boucheron]
But just when the kids were all grown and they
could enjoy their sunset years...L's wife passed.
[Boucheron]
L never got to feed his wife the last pastry he
baked for her...with a bolt of thunder.
[Boucheron]
...
[Boucheron]
...
[Lindon]
There, there, Boucheron... I find myself crying
as well today.
[Boucheron]
I realized when I got to that part...this story is
about you, isn't it?
[Lindon]
Indeed it is. "L," of course, is my first initial.
[Boucheron]
But why is there a book about you?
[Lindon]
I thought─before I join my wife in the beyond─
I'd record my life for posterity.
[Lindon]
But I was careless and lost the manuscript.
[Boucheron]
So you wrote this book? Well, now I'm sorry
I read it without permission.
[Lindon]
Nonsense. I'm genuinely glad that you picked it
up and read the whole tale.
[Boucheron]
It was wonderfully written, for what it's worth.
[Lindon]
Why don't we spend more time together? You
can get to know me until my last pages.
[Boucheron]
It would be my pleasure.
[Lindon]
Splendid! I'm in such a good mood that I think
I might bake another batch of sweets!
[Lindon]
But lightning-baking takes time, so why don't
you tell me your story?
[Boucheron]
Let's see, where to start? I guess with the day
my parents met...
