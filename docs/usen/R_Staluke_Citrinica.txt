=== Alcryst & Citrinne ===

[Citrinne]
Hyah!
[Citrinne]
I just can't seem to get this right.


[Alcryst]
Hello, Citrinne. Are you training with magic?
[Citrinne]
Oh! Alcryst! Where did you come from?
Are you lost?
[Alcryst]
What? No, I was just passing by.
[Citrinne]
I see. My goodness, you were so...quiet.
[Alcryst]
You always seem to be training in your spare
time, Citrinne. I admire your dedication.
[Alcryst]
I think you might be the hardest-working person
in all of Brodia.
[Citrinne]
I appreciate the kind words, Alcryst, but...
[Citrinne]
All of this training isn't enough. I'm still far
behind everyone else.
[Citrinne]
I must, must, must grow stronger.
[Alcryst]
Really? Why? I think you're fine as you are now.
Besides, I'll protect you.
[Citrinne]
Ah, yes. That's the same Alcryst I knew as a
child─placing others well ahead of himself.
[Citrinne]
However...I can't rely on your kindness.
[Citrinne]
When it comes down to it, I...
[Alcryst]
Citrinne?
[Citrinne]
No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.
[Citrinne]
I need to resume my training. Please excuse
me, Alcryst.
[Alcryst]
Oh, uh... All right, Citrinne...
[Citrinne]

[Alcryst]
Something is seriously bothering her...but what?

[Citrinne]
Oh, it's hopeless. My best is still so weak.
[Citrinne]
I... I don't deserve to be Alcryst's retainer.


[Alcryst]
I disagree.
[Citrinne]
Alcryst! Again? How long have you been there?
[Alcryst]
A while. I apologize for spying. I was worried
about you after our last chat.
[Alcryst]
Do you really believe that you don't deserve to
be my retainer? You know that's not true.
[Citrinne]
...
[Citrinne]
Alcryst, you and I are cousins─practically
siblings since we grew up together.
[Citrinne]
And, for as long as I've known you, you've
carried a low opinion of yourself.
[Citrinne]
Growing up in Diamant's shadow didn't give
you many chances to shine on your own.
[Alcryst]
That's true. I suppose it's still true.
[Citrinne]
But I've seen you shine. I see how amazing you
truly are.
[Citrinne]
You always spot a person's greatest skill or best
quality and make sure they're recognized for it.
[Citrinne]
You support and openly praise the people
around you.
[Citrinne]
I could go on.
[Alcryst]
You're giving me far too much credit...
[Citrinne]
A person like that should be protected. I've felt
that way about you since we were children.
[Citrinne]
But I was a fool to think I could succeed at that.
Convictions aren't enough.
[Citrinne]
I am simply not strong enough to keep you safe.
[Alcryst]
That isn't true!
[Citrinne]
I'm sorry, Alcryst. I'm so sorry that they chose
me to be your retainer.
[Citrinne]
If you weren't stuck with me...I'm sure you'd
have someone stronger by your side.
[Alcryst]
Citrinne...

[Alcryst]
Citrinne, do you have a moment?
[Citrinne]
Oh, Alcryst.
[Alcryst]
I'm not sure if it's because we're cousins or
what, but...we have a lot in common.
[Alcryst]
As you know, I find it...difficult...to accept my
own worth. I see that same struggle in you.
[Citrinne]
How do you mean?
[Alcryst]
You believe that you're too weak to be my
retainer, but you couldn't be more wrong.
[Citrinne]
Alcryst, you really don't have to try and make
me feel better about this.
[Citrinne]
In terms of strength, I am inferior to the other
royal retainers. That is irrefutable.
[Alcryst]
If you're referring to raw power, maybe.
[Alcryst]
But that's why you use every spare moment
you have to train, right?
[Alcryst]
Rain or shine, you haven't missed a single day.
[Alcryst]
You may lack physical strength, but you make
up for it in strength of will. That matters.
[Citrinne]
Perhaps, but...commitment to training is not
what makes a worthy retainer.
[Alcryst]
Again, I disagree.
[Alcryst]
Because I know how seriously you take your
role, it's easy to place my trust in you. So I do.
[Citrinne]
You do? Really?
[Alcryst]
Do you have any idea how reassured I was
when I heard that you would be my retainer?
[Alcryst]
Wait─reassured isn't the right word for it.
Let me phrase this more clearly.
[Alcryst]
I am so, so glad that you became my retainer.
[Alcryst]
Yes, we are cousins. Yes, we have known each
other since we were very young.
[Alcryst]
But I don't care about the obvious reasons why
you were chosen.
[Alcryst]
To me, the important difference is that you
volunteered for this position yourself.
[Citrinne]
I wanted to protect my wonderful cousin.
[Alcryst]
Exactly. I don't deserve that protection, but...
it means the world to me that you think I do.
[Alcryst]
That's why I'm happy things are like
this, Citrinne.
[Citrinne]
Alcryst...
[Citrinne]
That's...such a wonderful thing to hear you say.
It makes me want to redouble my training!
[Citrinne]
I have a long way to go before I know I can
protect you, after all.
[Alcryst]
Hey, wait─I'm the one who's protecting you!
[Citrinne]
Haha, of course. Thank you, Alcryst.
