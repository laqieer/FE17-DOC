=== Alear & Citrinne ===

[Citrinne]
Excuse me, Divine One. I wanted to thank you
for aiding me in battle the other day.
[Citrinne]
If it's not inappropriate, I would like to find a
gift for you to fully express my gratitude.
[Alear]
A gift? That isn't necessary, Citrinne. I only did
what anyone would have done.
[Citrinne]
Haha! Oh, Divine One. You're too modest!
[Citrinne]
Aha! A gift idea has just come to me.
[Citrinne]
An acquaintance of the Brodian royal family is
looking to sell their private island─at cost!
[Citrinne]
What would you say to your own private island
getaway? My treat, of course.
[Alear]
An entire island?! That's really not─
[Citrinne]
Not enough. I agree. Shall I add some of my
antique jewelry? It's just a few generations old...
[Alear]
No! Citrinne, I don't need expensive gifts.
[Citrinne]
Really? Then...what sort of gift would you be
more inclined to accept?
[Alear]
Well, if I can't talk you out of it...
[Alear]
To be honest, I would prefer the kind of gift
that money can't buy.
[Citrinne]
Something that money...cannot buy?
[Alear]
No private islands. No jewelry. I value gifts that
aren't defined by how much they cost.
[Alear]
That's the best kind of gift a person can receive.
Do you understand?
[Citrinne]
I see. Let me just...think on this for a while.
Farewell for now, Divine One.

[Citrinne]
Hello again, Divine One. I gave your words on
gifts some thought.
[Citrinne]
You said you would prefer something that
money could not buy...
[Citrinne]
I apologize for the delay. It feels as if I've kept
you waiting for days, weeks, months!
[Alear]
It really hasn't been that long...
[Citrinne]
To me, it felt like an eternity.
[Alear]
Do you have an idea?
[Citrinne]
Indeed I have. I think this token of my gratitude
will be much more to your liking. For you!
[Alear]
Oh. It's, uh...
[Citrinne]
It's a pebble!
[Alear]
Yes. This certainly is a pebble.
[Citrinne]
I found it sitting on the side of the road and
paid nothing to acquire it. What a thrill!
[Citrinne]
No cost. No worth. I quite literally stumbled
upon the perfect gift for you!
[Alear]
...
[Citrinne]
Is something the matter, Divine One?
[Alear]
I guess I didn't explain myself well enough.
[Alear]
Imagine that you found this pebble a long time
ago and kept it. Maybe you grew attached to it.
[Alear]
If you were to give me that pebble─one you
cherished─I would consider it a wonderful gift.
[Citrinne]
One that I...cherished?
[Alear]
You know, sentimental value? Worth that comes
from the heart rather than the wallet?
[Citrinne]
Worth that comes from the heart...
[Citrinne]
I think I understand.
[Citrinne]
Next time, I'll offer you something that will truly
delight you.
[Citrinne]
Rest easy, Divine One! I shall return!

[Citrinne]
Hello once again, Divine One. I've come to
give you...this gift.
[Alear]
Oh, Citrinne! What a gorgeous bouquet!
[Citrinne]
I thought of you as I picked each flower. I hope
these will suffice...
[Alear]
You hand-picked all of these flowers for me?
That's a wonderful gesture.
[Citrinne]
...
[Alear]
Citrinne? Are you OK?
[Citrinne]
I once had a very close friend who loved gifts...
and would make a game of begging for things.
[Citrinne]
Each gift made her so happy. Over time, it
became a natural part of our rapport.
[Citrinne]
Then, one day, I surprised her with a bouquet
just like this. She begged for a dress instead...
[Citrinne]
When I asked if she didn't like the flowers, she
grew angry. She said I was being...cheap.
[Alear]
That's awful. Is that why you offered to give me
such expensive gifts?
[Citrinne]
Yes. That's why.
[Alear]
If someone won't be your friend unless you buy
things for them, that isn't a real friendship.
[Alear]
I think this bouquet is a wonderful gift, Citrinne.
It makes me very, very happy. Thank you.
[Citrinne]
I'm so glad to hear it. I finally found the right
way to express my gratitude.
[Citrinne]
That makes me very, very happy as well.
Thank you, Divine One.

[Alear]
Here, Citrinne. Have a look at this.
[Citrinne]
Is that a dried flower? It looks familiar...
[Alear]
It's from the bouquet you gave me. I carefully
dried each flower for use as a decoration.
[Citrinne]
Oh! Yes, of course! I'm delighted to see how
you've taken such good care of them.
[Alear]
I think of your kindness each time I look at
them, Citrinne.
[Citrinne]
What a lovely thought. Thank you for sharing
this with me.
[Alear]
I didn't call you over just to show you
the flower.
[Alear]
This time, I have a gift for you.
[Citrinne]
You do? For me? What might that be?
[Alear]
This. The Pact Ring.
[Citrinne]
What?!
[Citrinne]
But this is a historic piece of jewelry. I suspect
it's worth more than all of my riches combined!
[Citrinne]
Why would you give this to me?
[Alear]
Don't think of how much it's worth. I'm giving
this to you as a token of our friendship.
[Alear]
I want you to be my closest confidant, Citrinne.
Are you willing to walk and fight by my side?
[Citrinne]
Oh my...
[Citrinne]
Of course I am, Divine One. I will happily accept
this gift.
[Alear]
I'm so glad to hear it.
[Citrinne]
Heh, you know, I love to give gifts, but I rarely
receive them myself...
[Citrinne]
You were right about sentimental value. A gift
from the heart is a wonderful gift indeed.
[Alear]
Couldn't agree more.
[Citrinne]
Thank you, Divine Dragon ...
I must be the luckiest person in the world.
[Citrinne]
When this war is over, we must attend a formal
ball together. I know that's a long way off...
[Alear]
Why wait? We could just dance right here
and now.
[Alear]
Think of it as a formal-ish ball. Just for us.
[Citrinne]
I'd like that very much.
[Citrinne]
What a gift exchange this is─you and I both
offering to support one another. It's priceless.
