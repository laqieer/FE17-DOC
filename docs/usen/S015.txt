=== Paralogue The Connector ===

(Garden of Memories)
A mysterious ring is enshrined in
a place that feels similar to the
Lythos Castle gardens.

[Alear]
Oh my! Are my eyes lying to me?
[Marth]
This is quite a surprise. It looks just like the
Lythos Castle Gardens.
[Alear]
So I'm not the only one seeing it?
[Marth]
It looks like the castle, but it feels like it too.
The air, the smells─all of it.
[Vander]
Right you are. I've served in the castle for many
years, yet this vision fooled me at first.
[Alear]
I know it isn't real, yet I still get a sense of
nostalgia looking at it...
[Alear]
My mother trained me in the castle garden.
The flowers were in full bloom...like these.
[Vander]
I remember it well. Alas, after the attack, that
garden has been left in ruins.
[Alear]
It has, hasn't it...
[Marth]
Look! Over there! I can see something
glimmering. Do you see it too?
[Alear]
Is that an altar? And on it... There's a ring!
[Vander]
I thought we'd gathered all the Emblem Rings...
Can it be that there were more?
[Alear]
Perhaps an Emblem we were unaware of?
Let's go have a look!
[Marth]
Wait. I feel a presence... There are enemies
nearby.

[Alear]
Corrupted?! They must be here for the ring!
[Alear]
We can't let them take it! That ring might
belong to another Emblem!
[Vander]
I fight beside you once more, Divine One!
[Marth]
Hm. That ring... Could it be?

[Alear]
We retrieved the ring safely! But it doesn't seem
to hold an Emblem? Strange...
[Vander]
Is it but a normal ring?
[Alear]
It seems so, but when I hold the ring, I feel
a warmth stirring in my chest.
[Marth]
So it's as I suspected.
[Vander]
What is it that you have surmised?
[Marth]
The "Pact Ring." It belongs to, and holds the
power of, Divine Dragon Monarch Lumera.
[Alear]
What else do you know about this "Pact
Ring," Marth?
[Marth]
Lumera once said that Divine Dragons will give
a special ring to someone they truly trust.
[Marth]
The ring strengthens the bond between the two
and brings them closer together.
[Marth]
It grants special powers to the Divine Dragon
and anyone they make a pact with, of any sort.
[Alear]
So, Mother...once gave this ring to someone she
trusted and had a special connection with?
[Marth]
That's what I'd guess too. But she'd lost her
friends and allies in the war.
[Marth]
So who she gave the ring to, or if she gave it at
all...there's just no way to know.
[Alear]
Mother...
[Marth]
But we know that, as long as she lived, the most
important person to her was you.
[Marth]
You should inherit the ring. Give it to your most
trusted ally.
[Alear]
I'll think long and hard before I decide who's
worthy to wear it.
[Vander]
That we've arrived at this place, it must be the
work of Queen Lumera.
[Alear]
It's a happy thought, Mother watching over me.
But the fight ahead is my own. I must be strong.
[Alear]
Let's go. I'm reluctant to leave...but there is
much work to do.

RAAARGH!

[Alear]
This is just like when I fought the soldiers my
mother created for our mock battle.

[Alear]
Mother is gone, but wherever she may be,
I'll show her how strong I've become!

Raaargh!
