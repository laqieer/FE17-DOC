=== Chapter 16 Seashore Travels ===

(Azure Coast)
While planning their next move
after getting a new ring, the Divine
Dragon's army receives a report.

--- OP ---




[Alear]
With Emblem Corrin added to our ranks, each
country's rings have been collected.
[Alfred]
Right. No more rings in the wild. Between us
and Sombron, they've all been taken.
[Alear]
Let's consider the situation.
There are five Emblems on our side.
Lyn, Lucina, Ike, Byleth, and now Corrin.
[Alfred]
Meanwhile, the Fell Dragon's got seven in his
grubby claws─most of them our old allies.
Marth, Sigurd, Celica, Micaiah, Leif, and Roy.
As well as another Emblem Ring his forces stole
from Lythos─the Azure Twins.
[Alear]
To gather all 12, we will need to face the
enemy directly.
[Diamant]
Are you proposing we invade Elusia?
[Alfred]


[Ivy]
Returning to Elusia already...

[Timerra]
Yeah, that's gotta be complicated.
[Ivy]
Indeed. But that aside, invading Elusia now
would be a mistake.
They have a clear advantage─seven Emblems
to our five.
[Alear]
The worst-case scenario is that they steal more
of our rings. That's what concerns me.
[Ivy]
If that happens, we can abandon all hope of
defeating the Fell Dragon.
[Alear]
But the longer we wait to attack, the more likely
it is they'll attack us.
[Diamant]
It's best that we strike first. One never wants to
be on the wrong end of an ambush.
[Ivy]

[Alfred]
But we're not ready to take the offensive.
Rock and a hard place, huh?
[Alfred]



[Vander]
Pardon the interruption.
[Alear]
Vander. What is it?
[Vander]
Word from the port of Solm─a number of
warships were spotted on the horizon.
Judging from the crests on their sails, they
appear to be Elusian vessels.
[Alear]
They're attacking the queendom again?
[Vander]
No, in fact...the fleet sails toward Firene.
[Vander]

[Alfred]
My kingdom...
[Alear]
We'd better take a look for ourselves.
[Timerra]
Let's head to the Azure Coast. It's near the
border, and it's got a clear view of the sea.



[Marni]
♪Hmm-hmm♪ Smooth sailing! At this rate,
we'll be the first ones in Firene.
[Mauvier]
It would seem so.
[Marni]
Wonder why Zephia told us to go ahead... Our
orders are to kill everyone we see, right?
With this kinda head start, think of the body
count we can get. We'll be heroes!
Seems like Zephia's really taken a shine to us.
Don'tcha think, Mauvier?
[Mauvier]
I do not particularly care. I have my orders and
I will follow them.
[Marni]
Ugh! See, this is why I can't stand you. You
never praise me, and you're no fun at all!
I thought Griss was bad! At least he's not the
boringest man in the world...
[Mauvier]
...
("イルシオン兵 $"イルシオン兵 [Paladin]
Lady Marni. Sir Mauvier.
[Marni]
You got something to report?
$"イルシオン兵 [Paladin]
Two soldiers have deserted the fleet.
[Mauvier]
Hm. Perhaps they had reservations about the
current strategy.
[Marni]
Whatever. Leave them be. We'll catch up later
and beat the daylights out of 'em.
$"イルシオン兵 [Paladin]
Ah, but...they took an Emblem Ring.
[Marni]
What?!
[Mauvier]
Explain.
$"イルシオン兵 [Paladin]
As a precaution, we kept each ring on a
separate ship in the fleet.
These soldiers attacked the guard on watch and
stole the Ring of the Azure Twins.
Warships are already in pursuit.
[Mauvier]
We will take chase as well. The ring must be
returned at any cost.
These soldiers, what are their names?
$"イルシオン兵 [Paladin]
Rosado and Goldmary.
[Marni]
Princess Hortensia's retainers? I thought those
two were behaving themselves lately.
[Mauvier]
No longer, it seems. Do we know where
they went?
$"イルシオン兵 [Paladin]
They were headed to Solm by wyvern.
[Marni]
All right, turn this ship around! Take us to the
coast of Solm!
Ugh! And we were in the lead! Those two are
in heaps of trouble.




[Rosado]
We're in Solm now. I think it's safe to say we
lost them.
[Goldmary]
Perhaps we should pause for a moment, then?
I'm sure your wyvern needs to rest her wings.
[Rosado]
Good idea. Let's take a breather and then start
looking for Hortensia.
We have to make sure she gets the Ring of the
Azure Twins.
[Goldmary]
Indeed.

.(イルシオン兵
*(イルシオン兵 [Lance Fighter]
Aha! There they are!
,イルシオン兵 (イルシオン兵 [Sword Flier]
Let's seize them!
*(イルシオン兵 [Lance Fighter]
(イルシオン兵 [Sword Flier]

[Goldmary]
Is a few minutes' rest really too much to ask?
[Rosado]
Let's get out of here, Goldmary!


[Alear]
That's an Elusian fleet, all right. And it does
look to be headed toward Firene.
We have to get there before they do.


[Timerra]
That'd be nice, but look. We've got Elusian
soldiers on the beach.
You wanna attack again, huh? I'll give you a
good old-fashioned Solmic welcome...

[Alear]
That's not enough troops for an invasion.
It looks more like a search party.

[Timerra]
Divine One! There's a wyvern coming this way!

[Alear]
They must've spotted us. Everyone, at
the ready!
[Timerra]
[Hortensia]
Hold on... Rosado? Goldmary?

[Alear]
...



[Rosado]
Hortensia!
[Rosado]

[Goldmary]
You're not hurt, are you? I was so worried...

[Hortensia]
Not as worried as I was! Oh, I'm so happy
you two are alive!
[Hortensia]


[Alear]
Nice to see you and your retainers back
together again.
[Goldmary]


[Rosado]
The Divine Dragon! Watch out!
[Alear]

[Hortensia]
Put that away, Rosado!
I'm on the Divine Dragon's side now. My sister
is too.
[Rosado]

[Goldmary]
Princess Ivy as well?
[Goldmary]


[Rosado]
Psst! If you're being held against your will,
blink three times.
[Hortensia]
I swear, it's not like that. I wanted to join them,
so I did.
I made this choice for Elusia. Question is─as my
retainers and my friends─will you join me?
[Rosado]
All right. If this is what you want, then it's what
I want too.
[Rosado]

[Goldmary]
Whatever banner you're under, I will defend it
with all my might.
[Hortensia]
Good. I knew I could count on you two.
[Goldmary]
[Hortensia]



[Rosado]
Um, Divine One? Sorry for drawing my weapon
on you. Here. This is yours.
[Alear]
Is this...
[Rosado]
The Ring of the Azure Twins. We stole it from
the ship we were on.
[Alear]
Thank you.
[Alear]

[Hortensia]
Good going!
[Rosado]

[Goldmary]
Hehe, I hope my dazzling abilities do not
blind you.
[Hortensia]


[Alear]
This is just what we needed.
Restore calm, Emblem of the Sacred!



[Eirika]
Finally, I am returned to your side. My name
is Eirika.
I raise my sword in hopes that peace will
come to this world at last.

[Alear]
I know we can depend on you, Eirika.
Now, which of you should I give this ring to?
You're both to thank for bringing it here.
[Eirika]
[Goldmary]
You ought to give it to Rosado.
Rosado flew us here. He was instrumental in
our escape.
[Goldmary]
[Rosado] Shy

[Rosado]
You were too, Goldmary! But there's no time
to argue, is there?
Lend me the ring and I promise, I'll do my part.

[Alear]
It's settled. Here you are, Rosado.


--- ED ---




[Alear]
The Elusian soldiers have fled. Marni and
Mauvier too.
Now we can head to Firene.
[Alfred]
Yes, right away! If those ships made landfall,
then my people are in danger.




[Zephia]
Ah, that cool breeze. Hm. Lovely, isn't it?
Almost a shame we'll arrive in Firene soon.
[Veyle]
I'm surprised you came with us, Zephia.
You're so loyal to Papa, I figured there was no
way you'd approve of this.
[Zephia]
Oh? Well, your father is my master. But...
Lately, his orders have been somewhat
concerning.
[Veyle]
I know exactly what you mean. He thinks
nothing of killing people.
I have the same blood in my veins, of course.
Maybe it's natural people mistrust me.
[Zephia]
Oh, Lady Veyle, no. I heard about those awful
things the Divine Dragon said.
That you killed Lumera? Stole the rings? If I
were you, I wouldn't believe a word of it.
After hearing who your father was, the Divine
Dragon probably said that to hurt your feelings.
[Veyle]
Hm. I've decided I won't harm anyone, ever.
Even if it costs me my life.
So I'm not going back to Papa. I don't want to
destroy this world.
[Zephia]
How kindhearted of you.
[Veyle]
If you two really want to help, then after I've
cleared up this misunderstanding...
will you help me find my sibling?
[Zephia]
What a silly thing to say! You are Lord
Sombron's only child.
You have no brothers or sisters.
[Veyle]
That's not true. We've met.
Look at this.
[Zephia]
How beautiful. It looks like a dragonstone.
[Veyle]
It is a dragonstone.
A thousand years ago, I was crying and one of
my siblings gave it to me. I remember it well.
"Even though I can't stay with you, I'll always
be your friend."
"If you're sad or lonely, remember...if this stone
is intact, that means I'm still alive."
As you can see, in all this time, it hasn't
even cracked.
[Zephia]
...
[Griss]
But that means... What does that mean?
[Veyle]
It means my brother is still alive, and I'm going
to find him.
[Veyle]
It means my sister is still alive, and I'm going
to find her.
Perhaps with his help, I can convince Papa to
end this horrible war.
Perhaps with her help, I can convince Papa to
end this horrible war.
[Zephia]
...
[Veyle]
Zephia, is something wrong?
[Zephia]
No, I'm just so...moved.
After we've finished our business in Firene,
Griss and I will help find your sibling.
[Veyle]
Thank you! I've been looking on my own this
whole time. You two will be a big help.
[Zephia]
Look, Lady Veyle! Firene on the horizon.
Why don't you take in the view? Maybe reflect
on what you'll say to patch things up.
[Veyle]
Good idea.
[Veyle]
[Zephia]
...
Another one of Lord Sombron's children
survived?
[Griss]
First I'm hearing of it.
[Zephia]
I don't understand... They all perished in the
war a thousand years ago.
All of them except Lady Veyle, who was too
young to fight.
I watched it happen, Griss. Watched as each and
every one of them met their end.
Unless... No.
[Griss]
What? Remember something?
[Zephia]
It's only a hunch. But if I'm right, we may have
a problem on our hands.
[Griss]
Good thing we heard this before she fell asleep.
[Zephia]
Yes. After all, once we've gotten to Firene and
uncovered the truth...
she will never awaken again.

[Marni]
Finally! This is where those thieves ran off
to, right?
[Mauvier]
By all accounts, yes. Now we sniff them out.

[Goldmary]
Moments ago the beach was dry, and now the
water is up to my ankles.
The tide here seems to rise and fall at a
moment's notice.
Try to keep me on dry land, will you? Ugh, I'd
hate to be stuck tromping around in the water...


[Rosado]
Our side's cuter for sure, but by the looks of it,
theirs might be tougher...


[Eirika]
Worry not, Rosado. With my power, you can
punch through even the hardiest foes' defenses.
[Eirika]
Relax
You may also call upon my twin brother's
abilities, if you like.

* 村人おばさん Surprise
村人おばさん
Yeah, I saw those troops on the shore. Be
careful, all right? And take this. Might help.

$ [Marni]
Huh? We came here to hunt a couple thieves.
What are you punks doing here?

[Marni]
Hahaha! Gotcha, sticky fingers! Wanna find out
what I do to no-good traitors?

[Marni]
Fine, we'll call it even. Next time, though?
You're dead. Super-duper dead.

[Mauvier]
Hm. I should have guessed Hortensia's retainers
would seek your forces out.

[Mauvier]
No mercy for mutineers.

[Mauvier]
I withdraw for now. But we will meet again.
