It is morning!


That did not wake you? Your sleeping skill 
is strong.
But this is it for you, I am afraid.
Your sleep ends now. Prepare yourself.
WAKE UP!


You are up!
Now break your fast.
I recommend miso soup.
And rice, of course.


Ah!
You are awake.
Let us break our fasts!


--- C2 ---

Make ready!
Kagetsu himself has arrived to wake you!


Sorry to be late.
I overslept!
It is evening.
I hope you had nothing important to do!


I see my future...
Vander is scolding me.
That is best avoided! I must go!


Good morning! Or is it evening?
Hah!
I seem to be in need of my own wakeup visit!


--- B1 ---

How long will you sleep, Divine One? It is 
already past noon!


Time is flying, Divine One! Hurry!
You must break your fast!
You are missing every mealtime!


Kidding! Still morning.
Oh, I know this look.
Mm-hmm.
Princess Ivy makes that face often.


I knew that would wake you.
You fell for my cunning plot!


--- B2 ---

Wake up, my friend!


Still sleeping?
I have more questions for you.
Well...
That can wait until later.


Ah.
Still sleepy, I see.
Get some rest.
I will make certain you are not disturbed.


Hello!
You are up early!
Will you go out with me now?


--- A1 ---

Early to bed, early to rise, as they say!
Who calls upon you? It is I, Kagetsu of Elusia!


It seems you have become used to my voice.
Divine One?
You are alive in there, are you not?


Phew, you woke up!
If you hadn't...
I would have been distraught!


I have succeeded in waking you.
Good! We have much to discuss.


--- A2 ---

I have arrived!
I will now honor our bond of friendship by 
waking you.


You said that friends help one another through 
their darkest moments.
Those words changed me.
Thank you for your wisdom, Divine One.


Y-you heard all of that?
No matter. I meant every word.
And I will help you through your darkest 
moments as well!


Rise and shine!
Excellent.
Today will be good.

Cherished partner!
I do enjoy calling you that.


I see that my voice no longer wakes you!
You are accustomed to me.
That is expected of one's partner, of course.
It makes me glad.
This love may have come to us unexpectedly...
But each time I see this Pact Ring on my hand, 
I am filled with happiness all over again.
I love you, Divine One.


My partner is awake.
I will set the mood.
On this day, as on every other...
I devote my love and my skill to you completely.


Was I too loud just now? Apologies.
I was happy to see you.
Allow me to correct my mistake.
Here, I will greet you more softly.
Good morning.


--- S2 ---

I am early! I did not want to wait.
May I come in?


Sound asleep.
If only my cherished partner did not have to 
fight in battle.
I wish to take away all of your pain.
But I know you are much too kind and giving 
to be content with that.
Whatever you must endure to grow stronger, 
I will have to allow it.
Vexing as it may be.


Good morning!
Are you ready to face today's battles?
I have a secret.
In the future I have seen...
we live happily ever after.


My partner is awake already?
Bright and early.
I want to hold you and never let go. But I 
suppose I must...
Eventually.
