=== Céline & Louis ===

[Louis]
Is the tea to your liking, Princess Céline?
[Céline]
Very much so. I particularly enjoy the aroma.
[Céline]
I smell a hint of citrus along with...floral notes,
yes? More than one variety, if I'm not mistaken.
[Céline]
It brings to mind the blossoms often found
during the warmer months.
[Céline]
Taken altogether, the scent is most pleasing.
[Louis]
I endeavor to satisfy.
[Louis]
This black tea is a mix of leaves from southern
Firene with dried fruit rinds and flowers.
[Céline]
It's heavenly, as the blends you prepare
always are.
[Céline]
The chance to sip the tea you brew is one of
the small joys that gets me through each day.
[Louis]
Haha, you're too kind, Princess Céline.
[Louis]
Somewhat related...do you remember the
special leaves I mentioned recently?
[Céline]
Yes, of course.
[Céline]
You said that they would produce a unique and
distinctive flavor, if I recall.
[Louis]
You recall correctly.
[Louis]
I have a lead on how one might acquire such
leaves. I take it that would interest you?
[Céline]
Truly? You're right. I'd love to sample it
for myself.
[Louis]
Excellent. The wait will be worth it.

[Céline]
Simply exquisite.
[Céline]
The depth! The fullness of this fragrance!
I've never had a black tea quite like it.
[Louis]
You enjoyed it, then?
[Céline]
Louis, "enjoyed" is an understatement.
[Céline]
I've sipped my share of tea in my life, but rarely
have I tasted any of this caliber.
[Céline]
I'm extraordinarily grateful to you for
the privilege.
[Louis]
It pleases me that you are pleased.
[Céline]
Might I trouble you for another cupful?
[Louis]
Of course. I have an ample enough supply of
leaves to brew another pot.
[Céline]
Thank you. Ahh, what a joy this tea is.
[Louis]
Haha, the bliss on my princess's face makes it
worth the trouble.
[Louis]
Ugh...
[Céline]
Hmm? Is something the matter with your arm?
[Louis]
Nothing of note. Just a minor incident on my
outing to fetch the tea leaves.
[Céline]
What happened?
[Louis]
These tea leaves were not farm-grown, alas.
They arise naturally in the wild.
[Louis]
The path to their native fields is treacherous,
due to the ferocious beasts who nest there.
[Céline]
One of these beasts attacked you...
[Louis]
Please do not let it trouble you. It is a surface
wound and nothing more.
[Louis]
I would bear a hundred injuries like it for the
sake of these precious tea leaves.
[Louis]
Now then, that fresh pot is ready for you.
Your cup, please?
[Céline]
I've lost my taste for it. Good day, Louis.
[Louis]
Have I offended?

[Céline]
Louis, I must apologize.
[Céline]
I left without finishing the tea you went to such
lengths to prepare for me.
[Céline]
All you endured for the sake of those leaves...
[Louis]
There is no need to apologize, Princess Céline.
[Louis]
It was I who soured your pleasant mood.
[Céline]
...
[Céline]
Louis... There are many joys in my life.
[Céline]
I have always held the way you prepare tea for
me to be among them.
[Louis]
Thank you.
[Céline]
It's true that the tea brewed with your special
leaves brought me more joy than usual.
[Céline]
That said...Louis, understand this.
[Céline]
It grieves me that you would put yourself in
harm's way to bring me that joy.
[Louis]
Princess Céline?
[Céline]
All I need is the pleasure of your company while
drinking tea. Any tea will do.
[Céline]
I need no extravagant gestures. That small,
everyday joy is enough for me.
[Louis]
Truly, I am chastened.
[Louis]
I see that I have misinterpreted your needs.
A blunder most unbecoming.
[Louis]
It's a mistake I'll not make again. I swear to you,
here and now...
[Louis]
I will remain at your side that I might safeguard
the small joys of your life.
[Céline]
Very good. I shall expect nothing less.
[Céline]
Now, if that is settled...might I ask you to put
on a pot of tea?
[Louis]
Certainly. I trust you will not mind if I do not
bring out the special leaves, yes?
[Céline]
Hahaha, I think that would be best.
[Céline]
Even an ordinary tea is elevated by the
everyday joy of these small moments.
