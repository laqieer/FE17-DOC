[Chloé] 
Louis! Were you watching me again?
[Louis] 
Indeed I was. You and your whole coterie 
of ladies.
[Louis] 
The sight of you all together pleased me to 
no end.
[Chloé] 
The way you talk, it sounds like you were taking 
in fine art at a gallery.
[Louis] 
To me, there is no greater art. The finest 
galleries fall far short by comparison.
[Louis] 
There are so many subtleties and nuances to 
be seen that I could do so all day.
[Chloé] 
That's really the whole reason you do it?
[Louis] 
It's no different than appreciating a beautiful 
landscape. I sit quietly and let it soothe me.
[Louis] 
I see no harm in people-watching, and I'm sure 
you of all people must agree.
[Chloé] 
Yeah. When you put it that way, I guess I do.
[Louis] 
I've seen the way you drop everything to moon 
over any especially picturesque scenes.
[Chloé] 
Like a princess and her knight...a prince and 
his servant...oh, or a pegasus and a maiden!
[Chloé] 
So many lovely scenes straight out of a fairy 
tale. I adore them all!
[Louis] 
You and I are kindred spirits in that respect.
[Louis] 
Here's an idea, why don't you and I have 
a little viewing party sometime?
[Louis] 
We can stand at a remove and point out scenes 
that catch our respective eyes.
[Chloé] 
That sounds like fun. I'm game if you are.

[Chloé] 
Take a look at that, Louis. Isn't it lovely how 
that couple shares a meal together?
[Chloé] 
The girl hand-feeds the boy, and then the boy 
returns the gesture.
[Chloé] 
So intimate...like a prince and princess from 
my fairy tales.
[Louis] 
It's quite a sight. One imagines the sort of lives 
they lead, how they met, and so forth.
[Louis] 
It's an interesting change of pace to observe 
your favorite scenes now and then.
[Louis] 
...
[Chloé] 
Uh-oh. For someone who just said it's 
interesting, you don't sound so invested.
[Louis] 
I'm sorry. There is something I feel is lacking 
after all, it seems.
[Chloé] 
Hmm-hm! And what would that be?
[Louis] 
I'm not certain, but...
[Louis] 
I suspect what's missing is...you.
[Chloé] 
Me? How so?
[Louis] 
Everyone adores you, Chloé. You're perpetually 
surrounded by friends.
[Louis] 
The closeness you show with those friends... 
there's nothing quite like it.
[Louis] 
The sight of it fills me with such joy that I 
would hold it in my mind forever if I could.
[Louis] 
The drawback, it seems, is that scenes without 
you in them lose their luster.
[Chloé] 
I can tell you mean that as a compliment, so... 
thanks, Louis.
[Chloé] 
But I'd be careful who I said that to.
[Chloé] 
I know where you're coming from with that 
hobby of yours, but other people...
[Chloé] 
It takes a lot of explanation before people will 
understand. Not all of them have the patience.
[Louis] 
Haha, I'll bear that in mind.
[Chloé] 
We should probably get going. That couple we 
stared at is starting to stare back.
[Louis] 
Yes, perhaps it's time for us to withdraw. 
Shall we see what else we can see?

[Louis] 
Shall we observe some more lovely scenes 
today, Chloé?
[Chloé] 
Sure, Louis. Here's hoping we can spot a really 
dashing one.
[Louis] 
Ah yes, I have this for you, if you wish.
[Chloé] 
You brought me...dried fish?
[Chloé] 
I've never seen any quite this color.
[Chloé] 
All those blues and greens and yellows... Hard 
to believe it's really food, huh?
[Louis] 
I'm told it's quite rare and not often found 
at market.
[Louis] 
That's the sort of folk food you prefer, yes? 
Take it in case you feel peckish.
[Chloé] 
Thanks, Louis. It looks great! I'm always eager 
to try something new.
[Chloé] 
But I don't think I ever mentioned to you my 
love for folk foods.
[Louis] 
Oh, Chloé. I've spent too much time observing 
you not to be an expert on the subject by now.
[Chloé] 
Hmm-hm! You're an odd one, Louis.
[Chloé] 
But then, I'm not one to talk.
[Louis] 
What do you mean?
[Chloé] 
I got you some dried grapes. Hope you 
like them.
[Louis] 
Why, thank you, Chloé. Grapes are my favorite, 
you know.
[Chloé] 
I do know. I've been watching you too.
[Louis] 
You've been watching me?
[Chloé] 
Just like you've been watching me.
[Chloé] 
No matter who you're with, Louis, it always 
looks like something out of a fairy tale.
[Louis] 
Haha, turnabout is fair play, it seems.
[Chloé] 
We know a lot about each other at this point. 
Hmm-hm! What a way to get to know someone.
[Louis] 
Isn't it, though?
[Louis] 
Some might call it odd that I learned your 
preferences via observation rather than asking.
[Chloé] 
Not me. It makes perfect sense, given our 
shared love for people-watching.
[Louis] 
I suppose you're right.
[Chloé] 
Well, if we both have our favorite snacks, is it 
time to go?
[Louis] 
Quite so. I think it's going to be another lovely 
day, my friend.
