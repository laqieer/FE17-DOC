Morning!
Lady Anna's here to wake you up bright 
and early!


Still snoozing, huh?
Say, if you're weak to mornings, does that make 
you strong against nights?
And if nights are weak to you...does that make 
them strong against mornings?
There's a triangle here. I can feel it.


Hey, Divine One!
If you need some effectiveness against morning,
I'd recommend trying the special weapon of 
early bedtime.
Good luck!


You're awake already? That was quick!
So quick, in fact, I have to wonder...
Do you really even need someone to come by 
and wake you up?

Lady Anna's wake-up service has arrived!


Still asleep?
That won't do.
Luckily I've got just the thing.
Introducing the wake-up plushie!
Put it out like this, set the timer...and get ready 
for a horrible noise!


You're awake!
My products never fail.
I'm gonna sell so many of these.
Um...
As soon as I get them to stop breaking on the 
first use.


Morning, Divine One!
Did I do a good job?
If you're happy with the service...
please recommend it to your friends!

Hey, get up! It's time for the festival!


Not easily fooled, are you?
Technically it wasn't a lie. Where I'm from, 
there's a festival every day, so...
Aw... I hope everyone's doing OK.


Morning, Divine One.
What? No, I'm feeling fine! Promise!
Good salesmanship demands a 
cheerful disposition.
Thanks for asking, though.


Ha! My plan worked flawlessly!
There's no festival here today...
but back home there's a festival every day. So I 
didn't lie to you!

The Divine Dragon's got lots of potential...


Back home in Wintertide Village...
there's a festival every day. Constant need for 
new products!
Your talent for ideas would make us both 
a fortune!


Hey, Divine One! Wanna move to Elusia?
I've got a great plan...
that'll have us swimming in gold.
No? Aw, why not?


Hi!
I've been thinking. I'm gonna need more 
product ideas...
and we make a good team.
Wanna help me out some more?

I've got a surprise for you, Divine One!
It's a potion that'll make your voice sound silly 
and squeaky!


You're not gonna sleep through this. Behold, 
the power of squeak!
I am Lady Anna, queen of the squeaks! 
I demand your fealty!
Hehehe, this is amazing! I hope it's permanent!


Aw, it wore off.
Did you really sleep through the whole thing?
Guess I'll have to find another potion.


Hi!
Here you go, Divine One. Drink up!
Come on, don't you trust me?
I promise it'll wear off eventually.

The Sweethearts Day necklaces are looking 
great so far!


We've done a wonderful thing.
Thanks to us...
lots of folks are going to have an amazing 
Sweethearts Day.
I couldn't have done it without you.


Thanks again...
for the necklace idea.
Still not changing the name, though, sorry.
It has to be the "Divine Dragon Pendant"!


Since they were your idea...
I thought you should know.
I'm still working out the details of my 
crafting technique...
but it's getting better every day!

Get up!
Three gold if you wake up right now! Now, 
now, now!


Still asleep, huh? That's OK.
I'll hang around for a bit.
I still can't believe you gave me the Pact Ring.
What a rare and valuable gift.
That's what I like about you, though.
You're not afraid to prove how committed you 
are to doing good business.
That's why you're a great partner. And a great 
friend too.


Good morning.
Are you ready to make some money?
As long as we're working together...
the gold is gonna roll right in. You'll see!


Hehe, I knew that'd get you.
My business partner understands the value of a 
gold piece!
That's why we work so well together.

Sweethearts Day is over!
Quick, Divine One! We need a new 
merchandising idea!


Sweethearts Day was great for us, but we can't 
get complacent.
If we wanna profit long term...
we need to find ways to re-create that success.
Our stuff flying off the shelves!
Customers scrambling to buy!
That's what we need. That's the path to riches.


Good morning! Oh, you were dreaming of all 
the fabulous wealth we're gonna rake in?
With me as your business partner...
it's only a matter of time.


Oh, you're already up! Good.
That's the energy we need.
Now let's get to thinking.
I know we'll come up with something incredibly 
lucrative once we put our heads together.
