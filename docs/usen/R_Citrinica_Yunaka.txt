=== Citrinne & Yunaka ===
--- C ---



[Citrinne]
Yunaka. Tell me what you have planned for the
upcoming Brodian assembly.
[Yunaka]
Sorry, could you try again? Only one of my ears
was ready that time.
[Citrinne]
I know you've been asking around for details on
the upcoming gathering of Brodian officials.
[Yunaka]
Uh...what?
[Citrinne]
Brodia is my treasure, as are its people. If you
have any criminal intentions, I will stop you.
[Yunaka]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. Back it up. I-I think
this might be a misunderstanding.
[Citrinne]
Oh? What exactly am I "misunderstanding"?
You are lying about your identity, are you not?
[Yunaka]
That's, uh... Well, I...
[Citrinne]
Don't bother denying it. You've fooled many,
but I know your true profession.
[Citrinne]
You're an assassin.
[Yunaka]
...
[Citrinne]
I assume you didn't consider someone like me
to be a threat.
[Citrinne]
As a noble it's my duty to keep my people safe,
and I can tell that you're up to something.
[Citrinne]
I've already gathered all the evidence I need. If
you don't confess, I'll tell everyone about you.
[Yunaka]
...
[Yunaka]
Yeah. It's true. I was a Brodian assassin.
[Yunaka]
Honestly, though, I've put that life behind me.
That's not who I am anymore.
[Citrinne]
Try harder.
[Yunaka]
I'm telling you the truth. Look, hear me out
at least. Please─I'll tell you everything.
[Citrinne]
...
[Citrinne]
Fine. I'll hear what you have to say...but later.
[Citrinne]
Know this, Yunaka...to protect Brodia, I can and
will act with a heart of cold steel. No mercy.
[Yunaka]
Yeah. I'll remember.
--- B ---



[Citrinne]
All right, Yunaka. I'll listen to what you have to
say, but if a single lie slips through your lips...
[Yunaka]
I'll start from the beginning. And I won't lie.
[Yunaka]
The girl in this story isn't named Yunaka.
She's called Larimar.
[Yunaka]
She's born to a poor family living in a town on
the Brodian bluffs. Her parents abandon her.
[Yunaka]
She isn't even old enough to understand why.
But then a man takes her in...an assassin.
[Citrinne]
Oh!
[Yunaka]
He tells her he wants a little helper.
[Yunaka]
So he trains the girl to kill.
[Citrinne]
To what end?
[Yunaka]
Easy money.
[Citrinne]
So this man foisted his profession onto you?
[Yunaka]
Correct.
[Citrinne]
And that's how you became an assassin...
[Citrinne]
There is tragedy to your tale, but you've earned
no sympathy.
[Yunaka]
I'm not asking for sympathy. And I'm not done.
[Citrinne]
Fine. Continue your story.
[Yunaka]
Wait─someone's coming.
[Citrinne]
Is that a problem?
[Yunaka]
We'll have to finish this another time.
[Citrinne]
Very well.
--- A ---



[Citrinne]
All right, Yunaka. We're alone. Finish your story.
[Yunaka]
All right.
[Yunaka]
The girl does as she's told─as she's trained to
do. Killing is just a job to her. Not personal.
[Yunaka]
Until one day, when the assassin who raised her
falls ill.
[Yunaka]
His disease is incurable. He has little time left.
[Yunaka]
So he tells the girl the real reason he took her in
was to set her up to succeed him.
[Yunaka]
And then, offering all the money they'd earned
together as payment, he gives her one last job.
[Citrinne]
No...
[Yunaka]
She feels mostly scorn for him. But she also
knows that, without him, she wouldn't be alive.
[Yunaka]
So she honors his last wish. She puts him down.
[Citrinne]
...
[Yunaka]
After that, Larimar gives up murder for hire.
Tries to move on with her life.
[Yunaka]
She changes her name to Yunaka, and that's it.
Here she is. Being someone new.
[Citrinne]
I see...
[Yunaka]
Now, about the meeting with the Brodian brass.
[Citrinne]
Right. I'm still suspicious of your intentions.
[Yunaka]
I was laying the groundwork for a project.
[Citrinne]
What kind of project?
[Yunaka]
Truth is, I've been wanting to set up a fund to
help underprivileged kids.
[Yunaka]
That meeting was going to be the start. I was
planning to propose the idea there.
[Citrinne]
Oh!
[Citrinne]
So that's why you've been asking so many
people about the Brodian assembly.
[Yunaka]
Exactly. My goal is to do all I can to make sure
no kid has to go through what I went through.
[Citrinne]
...
[Citrinne]
I've been a vicious fool.
[Yunaka]
What? No way. You were right to be suspicious.
That didn't bug me.
[Citrinne]
Yunaka, please allow me to help you establish
that fund. Consider it the start of my apology.
[Yunaka]
Wait, really?
[Citrinne]
As this war rages on, the number of children
who have lost parents grows and grows.
[Citrinne]
Brodia's heart is breaking. Many of our nobles
have been searching for ways to help.
[Citrinne]
Please, let me share my connections. I acted in
bad faith...and I must atone for that mistake.
[Yunaka]
No, no! You've got nothing to atone for.
Seriously, I'm nothing but grateful.
[Citrinne]
I'm relieved to hear that...
[Citrinne]
You're trying to do a wonderful thing here.
I will ensure that you find success.
[Citrinne]
You and I have a long working relationship
ahead of us. I look forward to it!
[Yunaka]
Yeah, we do! And I promise you, I'll never
forget this kindness.
