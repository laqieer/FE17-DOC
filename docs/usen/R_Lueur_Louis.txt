=== Alear & Louis ===

[Alear]
Louis? What are you doing there?
[Louis]
Oh, hello, Divine One. I wasn't doing anything
of note, really.
[Louis]
Merely observing those two over there chatting
with one another.
[Alear]
Um, OK. And you're doing that...why?
[Louis]
That is the question, is it not?
[Louis]
There are all sorts of philosophical implications
to the simple act of asking, "Why?"
[Louis]
To which I suppose I would respond...
for edification.
[Alear]
So you watch people chat in order to
learn things?
[Louis]
Precisely. There is deep meaning in these
seemingly simple encounters.
[Louis]
Through observation, many delightful and
subtle details reveal themselves.
[Louis]
When one treats them as one would treat a
gallery piece, can there possibly be any harm?
[Alear]
There, uh... I think maybe there can.
[Alear]
What's right or wrong goes beyond rules and
laws. There's courtesy and decency.
[Alear]
If you knew they didn't like being watched,
you'd stop, right?
[Louis]
But of course, Divine One.
[Louis]
I would never elevate my appreciation above
their own comfort.
[Alear]
Just so we're clear. Well then, I guess...I'll leave
you to it...
[Louis]
Very good, Divine One. I trust that I have eased
any concerns you had.

[Louis]
...
[Alear]
Hi, Louis.
[Louis]
Ah! Greetings, Divine One.
[Alear]
Are you doing your people-watching thing
again? I can leave if I'm interrupting.
[Louis]
Oh, you weren't interrupting anything. I was
thinking about my family.
[Louis]
I left three younger brothers behind back in
my hometown.
[Alear]
So you're the oldest?
[Louis]
Yes, I am the oldest of us four.
[Alear]
Wow. It must have been tough being the
big brother.
[Louis]
I suppose so, from a certain point of view.
[Louis]
Our mother passed away before her time, so it
was up to me to raise them.
[Louis]
But I love them nonetheless. We all muddled
through together somehow.
[Alear]
Maybe taking care of them is how you got to be
such a good retainer.
[Louis]
You know, you may be right. It takes quite a bit
to ruffle me, as it were.
[Louis]
And now that I consider it...growing up in that
way may have given rise to my little hobby.
[Alear]
How so?
[Louis]
Spending one's youth in an all-male household
gives one a rather narrow view of the world.
[Alear]
I... I guess.
[Alear]
Do your kid brothers do it too?
[Louis]
They do not.
[Alear]
That kind of pokes a hole in your theory, then.
I think it might just be you, Louis.
[Louis]
Haha, the mystery deepens.

[Louis]
Thank you for your help, Divine One.
[Louis]
I always have such trouble deciding on gifts to
buy for my brothers.
[Alear]
It was nothing. I'm sure they'd be thrilled to get
any gift from their big brother.
[Alear]
How's the letter going, by the way? You said
you were going to send one with the gifts?
[Louis]
That was my original intent, but I think
I've reconsidered.
[Alear]
Why's that?
[Louis]
Well, the purpose of the letter and gifts was that
I wasn't sure when next I shall be home.
[Louis]
But when it came time to put pen to paper,
I found myself merely staring at the blank page.
[Alear]
I wouldn't worry about the best way to say it.
Just write whatever you feel.
[Louis]
Something from the heart...
[Louis]
"How are you? I am doing well." Ugh, those are
the beginnings of a rather childish letter.
[Alear]
No, it's like the gift. They'll be happy to hear
from you no matter what you say.
[Alear]
The important thing it to make it clear. Take any
chance you get to tell them how you feel.
[Louis]
Wise words...
[Louis]
You are correct, of course. Thank you. I shall
include a letter after all.
[Louis]
And so long as I'm writing to them, I shall tell
them all about you.
[Alear]
Me?
[Louis]
My brothers should know how wonderful
you are.
[Louis]
You won't object to me introducing a precious
friend to my family, will you?
[Alear]
Aw, Louis. You're embarrassing me. But yeah,
that'd be nice.

[Alear]
Sorry to keep you waiting. What was it you
wanted to talk about?
[Louis]
Thank you for taking the time to meet with me,
Divine One.
[Louis]
...
[Alear]
Um...Louis?
[Louis]
Would you care for some tea?
[Alear]
I'm fine, thanks. So you wanted to discuss
something?
[Louis]
...
[Alear]
You're fidgeting a lot today. What's going on?
[Louis]
My apologies. I had hoped my anxieties would
be less obvious for all the world to see.
[Louis]
I brought you here to ask a straightforward
question.
[Louis]
Yet my hands are shaking, my face is flushed
with sweat, and my feet feel leaden.
[Alear]
If something is bothering you, just ask, and I'll
help in whatever way I can.
[Louis]
It's my brothers, you see. They strongly wish to
meet you once the war ends.
[Alear]
Is that all? Of course.
[Louis]
That's not all. It's the reason they wish to meet
you that has me so flustered. How to put this...
[Louis]
It would seem my brothers have discovered
just what you mean to me, Divine One.
[Alear]
What?
[Louis]
The letter I sent them contained some...effusive
praise for you.
[Louis]
In their reply, they said that they absolutely
must meet this person I spoke of so gushingly.
[Louis]
They even included our mother's heirloom ring
that I might present it to you.
[Alear]
...
[Alear]
So that's it.
[Louis]
I apologize for putting you in this predicament.
[Alear]
What a beautiful ring. And you're giving it
to me?
[Louis]
Pardon?
[Louis]
Yes. It would make me happy for you to have it.
[Alear]
Thank you, Louis.
[Alear]
You've had so much practice caring for your
family that I'd feel lucky for you to care for me.
[Alear]
That's why I have a matching gift for you,
if you'll take it. It's the Pact Ring.
[Louis]
You're too kind, .
[Louis]
When this war is over, we must visit my home
and sample the grapes it's famous for.
[Alear]
I'd like that. And I'd like to meet your family
as well, of course.
[Louis]
It feels odd to step out of serving you and grow
so close. But it's a step I'm happy I took.
