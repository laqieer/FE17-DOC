=== Hortensia & Lindon ===
--- C ---


[Hortensia]
Hey, Lindon! My sister's asking for you.
[Lindon]
Ah, thank you, Princess Hortensia. So sorry to
have made you fetch me like this.
[Hortensia]
That's OK─I had a thing to do and you were on
the way. Oh, that's a pretty painting!
[Hortensia]
The lady's beautiful... Is she your daughter?
[Lindon]
This lovely painting is of my even lovelier wife.
[Hortensia]
Yeah, she's a vision. You're a lucky guy!
[Lindon]
If she were here now, I'm sure she would be
delighted to hear you say so.
[Hortensia]
You'll have to introduce us next time she's
around. I'd love to meet her.
[Lindon]
Unfortunately, that will not be possible...
She passed away some time ago.
[Hortensia]
Oh... Oh no. I had no idea. I'm so sorry.
[Lindon]
Hm-hm, it's quite all right, Princess Hortensia.
[Lindon]
We raised three children together. They're all
grown now, off living lives of their own.
[Lindon]
I've had mages to train and keep me company,
and I'm sure she's at peace in the hereafter.
[Hortensia]
You've accomplished so much. I'm sure if she
were here, she'd say she's very proud.
[Hortensia]
Say, Lindon... Would you consider giving me
some lessons? I could learn a lot from you.
[Lindon]
I'm flattered that you would suggest the idea...
but I think it best for us both that I decline.
[Hortensia]
How come?
[Lindon]
I simply don't have the stamina to
teach anymore.
[Hortensia]
I understand. You've still got battles to fight.
I shouldn't trouble you.
[Lindon]
Don't fret! I'm sure there's a spry spellcaster
out there who would make the perfect tutor.

[Hortensia]
Lindon, can we talk?
[Hortensia]
I was hoping you might...reconsider giving me
some lessons.
[Lindon]
As I said before, Princess Hortensia, I don't
have the energy for teaching anymore.
[Lindon]
Besides, I've heard that you're already top of
the class in the Elusian Academy, are you not?
[Lindon]
There's no reason to rush your education.
Take the time to grow.
[Hortensia]
...
[Hortensia]
My father didn't live long enough to see me
make it on my own.
[Hortensia]
That's why I'm in a rush. I don't want any
more regrets like that.
[Lindon]
Ah, of course.
[Hortensia]
I want my father to rest knowing I can take care
of myself─like your children do.
[Hortensia]
You can help me with that, can't you?
[Lindon]
I understand you, truly. But...I have further
reasons to decline.
[Hortensia]
What do you mean?
[Lindon]
Since King Hyacinth's abrupt passing, Elusia
has been gripped in a moment of crisis.
[Lindon]
In a time such as this, even a minor incident
could upset the balance of our kingdom.
[Lindon]
To protect my beloved Elusia, I must dedicate
all of my strength to our reconstruction efforts.
[Lindon]
Under these conditions, I simply do not have
any time to devote to you, Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia]
So that's why Ivy was asking for you...
[Hortensia]
I'm sorry, Lindon. I was being selfish.
[Hortensia]
I was thinking only of my own education, while
you and Ivy are both hard at work for Elusia.
[Lindon]
No, no. You have nothing to apologize for.
[Lindon]
There's no fault in looking out for yourself,
Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia]
Maybe you're right. Thanks.
[Hortensia]
I am still a princess of Elusia, though. Let me
know if there's anything I can do to help.

[Hortensia]
...
[Hortensia]
What can I do for Elusia?
[Hortensia]
What can I do, Father? Help me...


[Lindon]
If he were here, I'm sure King Hyacinth would
say that you already serve our kingdom well.
[Hortensia]
Lindon...
[Hortensia]
How can you be so sure? My father's...gone.
[Hortensia]
Ivy was always the model daughter, but I...
I was more of a pain.
[Hortensia]
When I imagine him looking down on me, all
I see on his face is disappointment.
[Lindon]
I was originally a retainer to the king's older
brother─your uncle. I think you knew that...
[Lindon]
At that time...I did not think kindly of
King Hyacinth.
[Hortensia]
Really? I had no idea.
[Lindon]
There was a scrabble for succession, with your
uncle openly opposing your father's claim.
[Lindon]
In the end, the elder brother lost the battle for
the throne...and soon abandoned the country.
[Lindon]
I had argued passionately in favor of your uncle,
so I resented your father right out of the gates.
[Lindon]
But then, one day, he turned to me and said,
"Lindon, you serve our kingdom well."
[Hortensia]
Ah...
[Lindon]
I didn't know what to make of that. He and I
were supposed to be enemies!
[Lindon]
Then I realized that he meant it. In uncertain
times, we both cared deeply for Elusia's safety.
[Lindon]
That's why I can confidently speak for him and
say...you serve our kingdom well.
[Hortensia]
That means a lot to me.
[Lindon]
What's more, a parent always loves their child.
[Lindon]
King Hyacinth could never be disappointed in
you, Princess Hortensia.
[Lindon]
I've raised three children to your nil, so if I say
it's true...you have no room to argue.
[Hortensia]
OK, OK. Consider me convinced.
[Hortensia]
I really do feel much better now. Thank you.
[Hortensia]
I'm going to keep taking care of myself─and
keep doing my best. I'll make Father proud.
[Lindon]
That's it. That's the spirit.
[Lindon]
I may lack time, but I'm never short on words of
advice. If you ever need to talk, I will listen.
[Lindon]
You're a fine, accomplished young woman.
I'm eager to see what else you become.
[Hortensia]
I'll make you proud too, Lindon.
