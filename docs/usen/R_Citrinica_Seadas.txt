[Citrinne] 
Seadall, is it true that you can tell fortunes?
[Seadall] 
It is.
[Seadall] 
I can divine anything, from the day's fortune 
to a person's greater fate.
[Citrinne] 
What a marvelous talent! In that case... Would 
you read Brodia's future for me?
[Seadall] 
Brodia's future?
[Citrinne] 
Brodia is my home. I love my home.
[Citrinne] 
And since the start of the war, I have been 
worried about its future.
[Seadall] 
Ah, you'd like to know the fate of the 
kingdom, then.
[Seadall] 
It...may not be good news. Are you sure you 
want me to do this?
[Citrinne] 
Yes. I am prepared for the truth, whatever it 
may be.
[Seadall] 
Understood. Then let's begin.
[Seadall] 
Spirit of the Cards, cast your divine light so that 
I may see the fate that awaits great Brodia...
[Seadall] 
...
[Seadall] 
It is revealed. Brodia's future...
[Citrinne] 
Yes?
[Seadall] 
I see...nothing.
[Citrinne] 
Nothing? What do you mean, nothing?!
[Seadall] 
It's just as I said. I see nothing. That's what the 
cards have shown me.
[Citrinne] 
That can't be...
[Citrinne] 
Does that... Will the war bring my country 
to ruin?
[Seadall] 
I admit...I'm not really sure myself.
[Citrinne] 
I... I see. Well, thank you for the reading.

[Citrinne] 
...
[Seadall] 
Citrinne, are you still worried about my reading 
the other day?
[Citrinne] 
I am.
[Citrinne] 
I have thought of little else since.
[Seadall] 
I see.
[Citrinne] 
Brodia's towns... Have you ever been? 
They're wonderful.
[Citrinne] 
Especially after a nice, long bout of rain.
[Citrinne] 
The sun peeks out from the clouds and all the 
buildings glitterâ”€like a scene from a fairy tale.
[Citrinne] 
As a young girl, I used to sit by the window 
during storms and wait for that moment.
[Citrinne] 
I would even skip my ballroom dance practice 
and just sit there, waiting...
[Seadall] 
It's a beautiful story...like one from a book.
[Seadall] 
But reality isn't storybook beautiful very often. 
You can't just sit and wait for the rain to stop.
[Citrinne] 
What?
[Seadall] 
Sitting and worrying about what Brodia's fate 
might be won't help your homeland.
[Citrinne] 
I know that.
[Citrinne] 
I'm not waiting by the window anymore. I'm out 
there in the mud, fighting for Brodia.
[Citrinne] 
But I'm just one person. I can't protect the 
kingdom on my own.
[Citrinne] 
And that... Well, it breaks my heart.
[Seadall] 
...
[Citrinne] 
I have to go. Excuse me.
[Citrinne] 

[Seadall] 
Citrinne...

[Citrinne] 
Seadall, I apologize for losing my composure 
the other day.
[Seadall] 
No, don't apologize. I can see how much Brodia 
means to you.
[Seadall] 
But I wanted to share this with you.
[Citrinne] 
Share what?
[Seadall] 
I had a feeling you'd come, so I read Brodia's 
fortune again.
[Citrinne] 
And...what did you find?
[Seadall] 
It's not that Brodia has no future. It's that a fog 
had settled around Brodia's future.
[Seadall] 
I can finally see it.
[Seadall] 
I suspect the powerful feelings you hold for 
your home have driven the fog away.
[Citrinne] 
What did you see? What was on the other side 
of the fog?
[Seadall] 
Brodia, after the rain has passed.
[Citrinne] 
...
[Seadall] 
A period of darkness and strife will pass over 
Brodia and other countries...
[Seadall] 
But when it's over, the sun will shine from 
between the clouds on your home.
[Citrinne] 
...
[Citrinne] 
Haha, thank you. I hope you're not just 
humoring me.
[Seadall] 
Huh? What do you mean?
[Citrinne] 
That fortune... You're not just saying that to 
make me feel better?
[Seadall] 
No. I'm not running a scam or trying to make 
you feel good. I don't need to do that.
[Citrinne] 
I pray that is the case.
[Citrinne] 
I have to say, with your help, I have been able 
to face reality in a way I couldn't before.
[Citrinne] 
I can't passively wait for the future to come. 
I have to take it into my own hands.
[Citrinne] 
For Brodia's sake. For the world's.
[Seadall] 
I believe you will, Citrinne. And you have 
my support.
[Citrinne] 
Thank you.
[Citrinne] 
Ah! I nearly forgot. You must allow me to 
compensate you for your services.
[Seadall] 
Once peace has been achieved, you could give 
me a tour of Brodia.
[Seadall] 
I love exploring places I've never been before.
[Citrinne] 
That's a wonderful idea! Let's travel to one of 
the towns sometime soon. After a storm.
