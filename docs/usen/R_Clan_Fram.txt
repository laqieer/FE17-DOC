[Framme] 
It's about that time, President Clanne.
[Clanne] 
I'm all set, President Framme.
[Framme] 
In that case... I call this meeting of the Divine 
Dragon Fan Club to order!
[Framme] 
Woooo!
[Clanne] 
Yeaaah!
[Framme] 
Ahem. Our first and only agenda item is how to 
broaden the fan club's reach.
[Framme] 
President Clanne, you have the floor.
[Clanne] 
I think we should do something splashy to drum 
up people's excitement.
[Framme] 
Seconded!
[Framme] 
The only question is...what?
[Clanne] 
I have an idea.
[Clanne] 
How about we spread our message by 
making pamphlets?
[Framme] 
I'm listening.
[Clanne] 
See, everyone's heard of the Divine Dragon. But 
only a few know the person behind the title.
[Clanne] 
You and me, we could tell the world what the 
Divine One is really like.
[Framme] 
Yeah... Yeah! I'm picking up what you're 
putting down!
[Framme] 
Ooo, ooo! How about this─we slap the Divine 
One's beautiful face on the cover, and title it...
[Framme] 
"The Divine Dragon: Up Close and Personal." 
Boom!
[Framme] 
Inside, we have an interview with every juicy 
detail folks could possibly wanna know!
[Framme] 
Favorite foods, favorite weapons, hair-care 
routine, shoe size. The raw, uncut story!
[Clanne] 
...
[Framme] 
You don't like it.
[Clanne] 
I love it! That's way less stiff and formal than 
what I had in mind.
[Clanne] 
Just the sort of brilliant idea I'd expect from 
you, Madam President!
[Framme] 
I couldn't have gotten there without your 
suggestion, Mr. President!
[Framme] 
All right, let's get working on this pamphlet 
so we can hand it out all over town.
[Clanne] 
Uh, wait. All over town?

[Clanne] 
There are a lot of people here...
[Framme] 
Uh, yeah. That's kinda the point.
[Framme] 
This is our chance to tell everyone how great 
the Divine Dragon is.
[Clanne] 
Yeah, but...
[Framme] 
Come on, we both worked so hard on these, 
we gotta let the people see 'em.
[Clanne] 
Or instead, we could quietly put them down 
over there and...
[Framme] 
OK, showtime. I'll start us off.
[Framme] 
Listen up, everybody! My brother has a reeeal 
important announcement to make.
[Clanne] 
Aw...
[Framme] 
Psst, Clanne! That was your cue.
[Framme] 
You're the one who said people would think 
we're weirdos if we didn't introduce ourselves.
[Clanne] 
I'm just, uh...kinda nervous?
[Framme] 
Everyone's staring at us. This is a real mess.
[Framme] 
Fine. I'll introduce both of us, OK?
[Clanne] 
O-OK...
[Framme] 
All right, then! We are Clanne and Framme, 
the 33rd Stewards of the Divine Dragon.
[Framme] 
We will answer all your burning questions about 
the Divine One, with these lovely hand-bound─
[Clanne] 
Stop! Please stop! This was a bad idea!
[Framme] 
What?!
[Clanne] 
I can't do this. There are too many people. 
It's embarrassing.
[Clanne] 
They're all gonna think we're weird. Who even 
cares about the Divine One's shoe size?
[Framme] 
We do.
[Clanne] 
Ugh, I feel like such a wimp. I thought I could 
be a steward?
[Clanne] 
I'm not even cut out to be in the fan club. 
Sorry, Framme.
[Framme] 
Clanne, wait!

[Clanne] 
Ungh...
[Framme] 
OK, Clanne. Spill it. What are you sulking about?
[Clanne] 
Isn't it obvious? The pamphlets.
[Clanne] 
I can't believe I was too chicken to hand them 
out. I don't deserve to call myself a fan.
[Framme] 
Clanne, does every fiber of your being course 
with passion for the Divine One?
[Clanne] 
I mean, yeah. You know that.
[Framme] 
So? There you have it.
[Framme] 
You're a fan, plain and simple.
[Clanne] 
But... But...
[Framme] 
Being a fan isn't about what you do. It's about 
what you feel.
[Framme] 
If you've got that sweet, dragony passion in 
your heart, you're a Divine Dragon fan!
[Clanne] 
Huh...
[Clanne] 
Yeah. You're right. You're right!
[Clanne] 
And you know what? I'm gonna try again. 
I WILL pass out those pamphlets!
[Framme] 
That's the spirit!
[Clanne] 
But first, I think we better make a few changes.
[Framme] 
What, right now?
[Clanne] 
Right now. You said it yourself. Being a fan is 
about passion. Where's the passion?
[Clanne] 
We should write about our experiences with the 
Divine One, so our enthusiasm comes across.
[Clanne] 
There aren't enough illustrations either. Let's 
ask for help from someone who can draw.
[Clanne] 
And the interview needs...more. We didn't even 
ask if the Divine One prefers red or blue!
[Framme] 
Wow. Look at you, all motivated and stuff.
[Framme] 
That's the hardworking brother I know and love.
[Framme] 
These are gonna be the best pamphlets ever. 
President Clanne, let's get to work.
[Clanne] 
It would be my honor, President Framme!
