=== Corrin & Alfred ===

--- C ---

[Alfred] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Alfred] 
You've got a big family, right? What's it like 
having older siblings or a younger brother?
[Corrin] 
The older siblings were steadfast, while my 
younger brothers were arrogant, but still cute.

--- B ---

[Alfred] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Alfred] 
I was born into royalty, but you chose your own 
fate for yourself. I think that's amazing.
[Corrin] 
Thank you. My heritage was complicated, but in 
a way, that's what made me free to choose.

--- A ---

[Alfred] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Alfred] 
I was never in a position to choose my path. 
I wonder sometimes if that was a good thing.
[Corrin] 
Everyone's lives turn out differently. You never 
know when you'll reach your crossroads.
[Corrin] 
One day, you'll be in a position to decide your 
kingdom's future. That's a big choice in itself.
[Alfred] 
I'll take those words to heart. And I'll think it 
through before that time comes.

=== Corrin & Anna ===

--- C ---

[Anna] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
Have you...ever been to Nohr or Hoshido? 
You're the spitting image of someone I know.
[Anna] 
Nope. Those names aren't ringing a bell. Might 
have been one of my sisters? We all look alike.

--- B ---

[Anna] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I'm sorry I mistook you for someone else. I hope 
you can forgive me, Lady Anna.
[Anna] 
Hey, you called me Lady Anna! Nice! Next time 
I stock something good, you'll be first to know.

--- A ---

[Anna] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Anna] 
Corrin! I got in something great! It's a flower 
that draws good luck to you.
[Corrin] 
What a pretty flower! I'd love a whole bouquet 
of them. But I don't have any of your currency...
[Anna] 
It's not for sale. I just wanted you to see it. 
You know, so that good things will come along!
[Corrin] 
It must work, because one good thing has 
happened already. I made friends with you!

=== Corrin & Bunet ===

--- C ---

[Bunet] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I've heard you're a great chef, Bunet. What a 
wonderful skill to have. I'm envious.
[Bunet] 
It is, but being a great chef comes at a cost. I've 
yet to create a flavor I'm fully satisfied with.

--- B ---

[Bunet] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Bunet] 
Corrin, your Emblem Ring sparkles like a dessert 
made with the finest sugar. It is exquisite.
[Corrin] 
Oh, I hadn't noticed that, Bunet. But you're 
right, it is very beautiful.

--- A ---

[Bunet] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Bunet] 
Your ring, Corrin, it's marvelous. When I look at 
it, I start dreaming up entirely new desserts.
[Corrin] 
That's nice, but I'm worried my ring will distract 
you on the battlefield. Enemies will target you.
[Bunet] 
Then I won't look at it during battle. The cool 
feel of it in my hand will be inspiration enough.
[Corrin] 
Haha, a wonderful solution. Your heightened 
senses should be a strength, not a weakness.

=== Corrin & Boucheron ===

--- C ---

[Boucheron] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
You're a good companion, Boucheron. When I 
fight at your side, I feel myself getting stronger.
[Boucheron] 
You're pretty reassuring yourself. I hope you'll 
stick with me when I walk alone late at night.

--- B ---

[Boucheron] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Did our last battle tire you out? I was headed 
off for some fishing to relax. Want to come?
[Corrin] 
Count me in! Even if we get lost on the way, 
the two of us together will figure something out.

--- A ---

[Boucheron] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Once again, I'm really sorry. I can't believe I got 
lost coming back from fishing in broad daylight.
[Corrin] 
It's fine! I enjoyed the sight of the sun filtering 
through the trees on the long walk home.
[Corrin] 
The sunny forest was a nice change of pace 
from the long nights where I grew up.
[Boucheron] 
You're so nice to me, Corrin. I hope I can learn 
to always see the bright side like you do.

=== Corrin & Céline ===

--- C ---

[Céline] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I've heard you like tea, Céline. That's one thing 
we definitely have in common.
[Céline] 
Indeed? How splendid that we share an interest! 
Do tell me all about your favorite blends.

--- B ---

[Céline] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Céline] 
I'm fascinated to hear of your favorite teas. You 
describe them so well I can practically taste it.
[Corrin] 
It's a shame I'll never get to sip them again now. 
A post-battle cup of tea is very soothing.

--- A ---

[Céline] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Céline] 
I've brewed some tea for you, Corrin. Though 
you can't taste it, the smell may do you good.
[Corrin] 
Ah! This smells just like the tea that my butler 
would make whenever I was exhausted.
[Céline] 
Excellent. I brewed it based on your description. 
I felt so sad that you could no longer drink it.
[Corrin] 
I'm touched that you went through all the 
trouble. Nobody brews tea like you, Céline.

=== Corrin & Chloé ===

--- C ---

[Chloé] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Chloé] 
You know what'd make a nice picture? You and 
a dashing prince. Or maybe an obedient butler!
[Corrin] 
Chloé, if we're going to be fighting side by side, 
I think maybe you should be the one next to me.

--- B ---

[Chloé] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Chloé] 
Can you really become a dragon?! That's so 
perfect! We should find you a king or a maiden.
[Corrin] 
You've got that distant stare again. I'm afraid to 
ask who you're picturing me with this time.

--- A ---

[Chloé] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
We've been working together for so long, but 
you never picture yourself with me, Chloé.
[Chloé] 
Sorry, Corrin. But I'm just a knight. You need 
someone much more epic to stand beside.
[Corrin] 
Nonsense. How many battles have we fought 
together now? We're already great partners.
[Chloé] 
Aww. That's so nice of you to say. The two of 
us side by side must be pretty magical indeed!

=== Corrin & Citrinne ===

--- C ---

[Citrinne] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Thank you for lending me your power, Corrin. 
I must repay you. What gift would you like?
[Corrin] 
Oh, stop. There's no need to "repay" anything. 
I'm just happy to fight by your side, Citrinne.

--- B ---

[Citrinne] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I know you don't need me to repay you, but... 
I couldn't stop myself. How do you like them?
[Corrin] 
All these accessories? Hats, swimsuits, masks... 
Where did you even get all of this?!

--- A ---

[Citrinne] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I feel so foolish. I was in such a rush to repay 
you, I forgot that Emblems can't hold anything.
[Corrin] 
It's OK. I got to admire so many fun things! 
Thank you for showing me a wonderful time.
[Citrinne] 
That's kind of you to say. I want to repay you 
again, but in non-material ways this time.
[Corrin] 
Emblems thrive on the feelings of others. 
Your gratitude is the only gift I need!

=== Corrin & Clanne ===

--- C ---

[Clanne] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Clanne] 
Standing by you feels sort of like being next to 
the Divine Dragon. Like you're...more than me.
[Corrin] 
Perhaps because I have dragon blood? Oh, did 
you know I used to take the shape of a dragon?

--- B ---

[Clanne] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Clanne] 
Um, Lady Corrin, when you turned into a 
dragon, how did it feel? Weird? Tingly?
[Corrin] 
The thing I feel most is how people look at me. 
Surprise, fear, awe... I've yet to get used to it.

--- A ---

[Clanne] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Clanne] 
I'm always with you, but I still haven't seen you 
turn into a dragon. Could you do it right now?
[Corrin] 
I can't fully transform now, just alter parts of 
my body. I'm sorry to disappoint.
[Clanne] 
No! I'm sorry for making a selfish request! 
I wanted to know more about my new friend.
[Corrin] 
I'm glad you consider us friends! Oh! I've never 
asked... Do you turn into anything?

=== Corrin & Diamant ===

--- C ---

[Diamant] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Diamant] 
Building and protecting a kingdom requires a 
powerful army...but that calls for great restraint.
[Corrin] 
I agree. Too many conflicts end with one side 
being wiped out.

--- B ---

[Diamant] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I was forced to make a terrible choice in a 
brutal war. After that, there was no going back.
[Diamant] 
I see... Ruling my kingdom may require such 
impossible choices someday. I need to be ready.

--- A ---

[Diamant] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I don't regret my choice, but I've sometimes 
wondered if there was another option.
[Diamant] 
What strategy would follow? Not attacking, but 
not retreating? Surrender to both sides?
[Corrin] 
When you say it like that...I'm honestly not sure 
what would have followed such a choice.
[Diamant] 
It may have been hard, but you didn't run from 
making a tough call. I admire your will, Corrin.

=== Corrin & Etie ===

--- C ---

[Etie] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
You're in incredible physical form, Etie. It's 
almost distracting when we fight together.
[Etie] 
Hah, thanks! Your praise gets me so fired up 
that I've gotta go jog away the energy. See you!

--- B ---

[Etie] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Etie] 
Corrin! Did I just see your arm muscles bulge 
out and get huge for a second there?!
[Corrin] 
You must've seen me partway in dragon form. 
I know it's impressive, but don't try to imitate it.

--- A ---

[Etie] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Etie] 
It was nice of you to say I'm in peak physical 
form, but I don't hold a candle to you.
[Corrin] 
That's not true. My dragon transformations 
aside, I'm really not all that muscular.
[Etie] 
But you're stronger than me in spirit. I've got a 
long road ahead if I want to be as tough as you.
[Corrin] 
Etie, I've seen how strong your will is. Whatever 
you want to make of yourself, you can do it.

=== Corrin & Fogado ===

--- C ---

[Fogado] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Fogado] 
You know, I used to get in trouble for sneaking 
into the fortress where your ring was kept.
[Corrin] 
Is that right? Well, from now on, no sneaking is 
required. You can see me whenever you like.

--- B ---

[Fogado] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
The battle the other day...it was in a beautiful 
spot. I guess that's strange to say during a war.
[Fogado] 
No, we should appreciate beauty when we can. 
One day I'll show ya all of Solm's prettiest sites.

--- A ---

[Fogado] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I can't wait to see your country's idyllic places. 
But it's Solm's blue sea I'm most excited about.
[Fogado] 
Let's go, then! It's stunning, and the fishing is 
great...though I'm no good at it myself.
[Corrin] 
It's easy. You just put something shiny on the 
line to catch the fish's eye. Shiny...like my ring!
[Fogado] 
Ha! No way am I throwin' your Emblem Ring in 
the water! But we will go to the sea.

=== Corrin & Framme ===

--- C ---

[Framme] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Framme] 
I'm busy looking after the Divine Dragon, but I 
feel like I should look after you too, Lady Corrin.
[Corrin] 
That's very kind of you, Framme, but you're so 
young. I think I should be looking after you.

--- B ---

[Framme] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Framme] 
Please don't worry about asking me to do stuff 
for you. I may be young, but I'm super reliable.
[Corrin] 
You are very reliable in battle, Framme. But in 
day-to-day things, you are a bit, uh, clumsy.

--- A ---

[Framme] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I hope you'll come to rely on me one day, 
Framme. Unless you're worried you can't?
[Framme] 
No, that's not it. I just wish we had our own 
secret signal. Like, a special look or a wink.
[Corrin] 
A special wink between us...interesting. So how 
about this? Make eye contact and...
[Framme] 
Hehehe, yes! That's the perfect secret signal for 
us, Lady Corrin! You're the best!

=== Corrin & Goldmary ===

--- C ---

[Goldmary] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
You're always so poised and relaxed in battle, 
Goldmary. How do you do it?
[Goldmary] 
A luxurious hot spring bath refreshes my body 
and leaves me with a serenity that lasts all day.

--- B ---

[Goldmary] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Goldmary] 
When I'm bathing in a hot spring, I feel as if 
all my worries are simply drifting away.
[Corrin] 
I know what you mean! Back home, I'd soak 
until my fingers and toes were all wrinkled up.

--- A ---

[Goldmary] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I should take you to visit my home village, 
Corrin. We have hot springs all over.
[Corrin] 
That sounds idyllic! Of course, I'd love to go.
[Corrin] 
This is a bit silly, but since I won't be able to 
bathe, maybe you could...dip my ring in for me?
[Goldmary] 
That is a request I'm happy to honor. We'll 
make sure your ring comes out sparkling.

=== Corrin & Hortensia ===

--- C ---

[Hortensia] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Why does everyone who shows up here have to 
be so adorable?! There's too much competition.
[Corrin] 
We do have a good-looking army, don't we? 
I think it's lovely.

--- B ---

[Hortensia] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I love the way you tell everyone they're 
adorable, Hortensia. It's great for morale.
[Hortensia] 
Is that really what it looks like to you, or are you 
teasing me? I can't tell.

--- A ---

[Hortensia] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
Your hair color is delightfully unique. I assume 
you use some kind of dye?
[Hortensia] 
Yep. The two-tone effect is pretty cute, right? 
I'm surprised an Emblem knows about this stuff.
[Corrin] 
Hair dye was popular in my world as well. 
My little sister used it a lot like you do.
[Hortensia] 
I didn't know you had a little sister! I guess 
I'll have to fill that role for you now, won't I?

=== Corrin & Ivy ===

--- C ---

[Ivy] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Ivy] 
Hello, Corrin. Did you need something from me?
[Corrin] 
No, no. I just thought we could have a chat. 
If you're busy, though, I'll try another time.

--- B ---

[Ivy] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Ivy] 
It must be terribly boring to follow a surly one 
like me around. You have my apologies.
[Corrin] 
On the contrary, I'm very entertained. I enjoy 
seeing all the subtle ways you express yourself.

--- A ---

[Ivy] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Ivy] 
We've only spent a few battles together, and yet 
I feel you've learned to see right through me.
[Corrin] 
If that's true, it's not by any power of mine. 
It's because you've learned to open your heart.
[Ivy] 
I do not trust people easily. Somehow it is 
different with you, though. I can't explain why.
[Corrin] 
Regardless of the reason, I'm glad to hear it. 
I hope we can converse like this more often.

=== Corrin & Jade ===

--- C ---

[Jade] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I've heard you write novels, Jade. Would you 
mind if I read them sometime?
[Jade] 
I wouldn't mind at all. In fact, I'd actually love 
to know what you think of them, Corrin.

--- B ---

[Jade] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Jade] 
Corrin? You look upset... If my novels aren't 
your style, you can tell me. I won't take it hard.
[Corrin] 
No, no─seeing you reminds me how funny they 
are... And now I can't...stop laughing, hehe!

--- A ---

[Jade] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Jade] 
Have you calmed down at all, Corrin? Or will I 
still cause a giggle fit just by standing here?
[Corrin] 
All better now. Your novels were so good! You 
make me want to try writing stories of my own.
[Jade] 
I hope you do! I would love to read any kind of 
novel you might write.
[Corrin] 
Is there any greater feeling than to know your 
actions will bring someone joy? I doubt it.

=== Corrin & Jean ===

--- C ---

[Jean] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
You're aiming to become a doctor, right? I'd let 
you treat me, but I don't have any injuries.
[Jean] 
Don't feel bad. Health is important! Most people 
envy the way Emblems can't get ill or wounded.

--- B ---

[Jean] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
If both sides agreed not to target doctors, 
there'd be a lot fewer casualties in war.
[Jean] 
That's a nice thought, Corrin. It's true, though. 
If we could manage that, we'd all be better off.

--- A ---

[Jean] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
When a doctor saves a soldier, they also save 
the soldier's whole family. It's a good thing.
[Jean] 
Yeah. Every life matters to a lot of people. 
I want to help there be fewer tragedies of war.
[Corrin] 
If there was even one more doctor like you, 
I think that peace would be within our grasp.
[Jean] 
Thank you, Corrin. That means a lot to me. 
I'll work my hardest to be a first-rate doctor!

=== Corrin & Kagetsu ===

--- C ---

[Kagetsu] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
Spending time with you reminds me of my 
birthplace, Kagetsu. You have a similar air.
[Kagetsu] 
If it is anything like my homeland, then its air 
must be wonderful indeed!

--- B ---

[Kagetsu] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Corrin! Will you go out with me so you can tell 
me more about your birthplace?
[Corrin] 
Go out with you?! I'll gladly tell you more, but 
I don't see how that's necessary.

--- A ---

[Kagetsu] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
It was fun to go out with you, Corrin! I was 
quite pleased by your stories of Hoshido.
[Corrin] 
I'm glad. I enjoy talking about home. Thinking of 
those I miss, I feel power stir within me.
[Kagetsu] 
In that case, you must speak of them more! 
I wish to see you at your very strongest.
[Corrin] 
Hehe, I appreciate the thought. But I feel the 
same power just thinking of you, Kagetsu.

=== Corrin & Lapis ===

--- C ---

[Lapis] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I saw you picking plants after that last battle, 
Lapis. Are you using them for something?
[Lapis] 
Yep! Emergency provisions. I did this a lot back 
in the country. Ahh! How did I slip up so fast?

--- B ---

[Lapis] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Lapis] 
No one knows I'm a bumpkin. If anyone asks 
about the wild plants...they're for crafts, OK?
[Corrin] 
I see. I once wished I could hide my own origin. 
People assumed many things about me...

--- A ---

[Lapis] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Lapis] 
I hid my country roots out of shame...but it 
sounds like you had more dire reasons, Corrin.
[Corrin] 
My two homelands were at war with each other. 
My upbringing was a tangled web of deception.
[Corrin] 
But don't compare yourself to me. If you want 
to keep your origin a secret, I'll support you.
[Lapis] 
No platitudes? Phew. Thank you, Corrin. I hope 
I'm as strong as you someday.

=== Corrin & Lindon ===

--- C ---

[Lindon] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Lindon] 
So you fight by transforming, just like the 
Divine Dragon. I have many questions...
[Corrin] 
I'd be happy to provide whatever answers I can. 
Your experiments are fascinating to me.

--- B ---

[Lindon] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Lindon] 
Since you're interested in my experiments, tell 
me this: which tome should I bake with next?
[Corrin] 
I'd go with fire magic, but the gravity magic my 
little brother used to use might also work well.

--- A ---

[Lindon] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Lindon] 
I'm not as young as I like to pretend. Maybe it's 
time I stopped doing these strange experiments.
[Corrin] 
Don't talk that way! You're never too old to do 
what you love. Besides, you're still young to me.
[Lindon] 
In what sense?! Oh, hmm, I suppose that's true 
for an Emblem. In that case, let's get baking!
[Corrin] 
Haha, that's the spirit. Now we just need to 
decide which tome to use for this one!

=== Corrin & Louis ===

--- C ---

[Louis] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
The way you're always one step behind me 
is a lot like the butler I once had.
[Louis] 
Where your butler and I differ is that I stay one 
step back in order to remain virtually invisible.

--- B ---

[Louis] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
You really don't have to be invisible, Louis. 
I'm glad to have you around.
[Louis] 
I should have said that I wished to blend into 
the background...

--- A ---

[Louis] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I get you now, Louis. You want to fade into the 
background for your people-watching hobby.
[Louis] 
Quite right. So you see, you needn't worry 
about my fading into the background.
[Corrin] 
But I love it when people get along too! You 
should take me with you next time!
[Louis] 
Ah! You and I, invisible to all but one another... 
An intriguing dynamic I had never considered.

=== Corrin & Alear ===

--- C ---

[Alear] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I spent most of my youth cooped up in a castle. 
Everything felt fresh when I got to leave.
[Alear] 
I can relate to that. It sounds like our 
circumstances aren't so different.

--- B ---

[Alear] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Alear] 
So often in battle, the choices before me are so 
heavy that I find myself paralyzed.
[Corrin] 
I know that feeling. Sometimes I wonder what 
would've happened if I'd chosen differently.

--- A ---

[Alear] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Alear] 
Do you ever start second-guessing yourself 
after making an important decision?
[Corrin] 
There's one choice I always reflect on. Every 
option would hurt those I cared for...
[Corrin] 
But I don't regret it. I chose what I did for the 
sake of the people I trusted the most.
[Alear] 
Thanks. Thinking about who I trust is a good 
signpost for any tough calls I have to make.

=== Corrin & Mauvier ===

--- C ---

[Mauvier] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Lady Corrin, you chose your own path in life. 
I could not even choose my own faith...
[Corrin] 
Don't feel sad about the past. It's why you are 
who you are. It's why you met Lady Veyle.

--- B ---

[Mauvier] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
You never chose your faith, yet you did choose 
to fight alongside us. That's just as important.
[Mauvier] 
True, perhaps. However, Marni's life may have 
been saved had I made my decision sooner.

--- A ---

[Mauvier] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
Everyone imagines how life may have gone if 
they'd chosen differently. Let go of your regret.
[Corrin] 
Everyone's choices remain forever. Please don't 
look back. Look toward tomorrow, Mauvier.
[Mauvier] 
Yes. Still, it is a fact that I served as one of the 
Four Hounds, and that I allowed a friend to die.
[Mauvier] 
However, people such as yourself say they 
respect me. I want to be worthy of that.

=== Corrin & Merrin ===

--- C ---

[Merrin] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Lady Corrin, I will protect you. I know you're 
strong, but still, I feel it's my duty as a knight.
[Corrin] 
Thank you kindly, but I can't be injured. What's 
important to me is that you protect yourself.

--- B ---

[Merrin] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
I know we're comrades in arms and equals. Still, 
I wish I was the protector keeping you safe.
[Corrin] 
I understand. It feels good to be the protector. 
Who wouldn't want that?

--- A ---

[Merrin] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Lady Corrin, I just heard you can turn into a 
dragon! Can you go all dragony for me, please?
[Corrin] 
I'm sorry, but in this world, it seems I can't fully 
turn into a dragon.
[Merrin] 
What?! Aw! But I'm dying to see it! No, I'm not 
giving up. I'll be patient and maybe it'll happen.
[Corrin] 
I'm not sure that's ever... Oh, never mind. I hope 
one day I can go "all dragony" for you, Merrin.

=== Corrin & Timerra ===

[Timerra] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Timerra] 
Corrin, I just want to thank you. I feel so lucky 
that my country was entrusted with your ring!
[Corrin] 
I feel lucky as well, Timerra. After all, it was you 
who came to get me. Now, let's win this war!

--- B ---

[Timerra] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Timerra] 
Do you like to sing, because there's nothing I 
love more. And I adore singing with others too!
[Corrin] 
I do. Songs were important in my world. They 
could be far more powerful than words alone.

--- A ---

[Timerra] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Timerra] 
You said you liked singing, but I've never heard 
you even once. Would you sing a song for me?
[Corrin] 
Oh, well, I enjoy it, Timerra, but I'm not really 
very good at it.
[Timerra] 
Singing isn't about being good or bad, it's about 
freeing your heart. Let me hear you, please!
[Corrin] 
OK, I'll try. ♪You are the ocean's gray waves, 
destined to seek...♪

=== Corrin & Pandreo ===

--- C ---

[Pandreo] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Pandreo] 
I hesitate to ask one such as yourself, but do 
you have a confession you'd like me to hear?
[Corrin] 
Confession? Oh, right, you're a cleric. Nothing is 
weighing on me at the moment, but thank you.

--- B ---

[Pandreo] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lady Corrin, your emotional strength is truly 
profound. I must tell you, I'm filled with respect.
[Corrin] 
Oh, I have a lot of experience, I guess. But I'm 
still learning. I really don't belong on a pedestal.

--- A ---

[Pandreo] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
Pandreo, why have you been so formal with 
me? You seem so laid-back with everyone else.
[Pandreo] 
Emblems are practically god-like beings! As a 
cleric, it is my duty to show you respect.
[Corrin] 
I can see how you'd think that, but I feel like a 
regular person. I wish you'd relax around me.
[Pandreo] 
If that is your wish, far be it from me to refuse. 
Ahem... It's tiiiime to party, Corrin! AROOO!

=== Corrin & Panette ===

--- C ---

[Panette] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Panette] 
Your skills on the battlefield are impressive. 
Surely you are equally skilled in a street brawl?
[Corrin] 
Street...brawl? My siblings and I used to fight, 
but I can't say if I was especially good at it.

--- B ---

[Panette] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Panette] 
So, you and your siblings fought, did you? My 
elder brother and I have also slugged it out.
[Corrin] 
Slugged it out? Oh, yes... I've done far worse 
than that to them...

--- A ---

[Panette] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I fought in a war once in which my siblings were 
also my enemy. It was so painful. Never again.
[Panette] 
I'm so sorry. I can't imagine anything more 
awful than fighting in a war against my brother.
[Corrin] 
With siblings, even small disputes can turn into 
big fights. The question is, is it really worth it?
[Panette] 
Oh, Lady Corrin, that is a good point indeed. 
This has been a valuable lesson. Thank you.

=== Corrin & Rosado ===

--- C ---

[Rosado] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Rosado] 
I'm not what you expect to see on a big wyvern. 
The contrast enhances my cuteness, doesn't it?
[Corrin] 
Contrast. Interesting. I wonder if transforming 
into a dragon would have the same effect...

--- B ---

[Rosado] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I don't think contrast enhances cuteness. My 
dragon form's only ever frightened people.
[Rosado] 
I didn't know you were still thinking about that. 
Maybe it's that you only transform to fight?

--- A ---

[Rosado] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I've been thinking about what you said, Rosado. 
It's true I only used my dragon form for combat.
[Rosado] 
Yeah. It'd be cute to be a dragon during, say, 
snack time. But that might ruin the majesty of it.
[Corrin] 
Maybe. It's a moot point now, since I can no 
longer transform. But thanks for indulging me.
[Rosado] 
Not sure what you're so worried about. Not to 
pad your ego, but...you're adorable.

=== Corrin & Saphir ===

--- C ---

[Saphir] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
This war has been such a trial for everyone. 
It's hard for me not to feel inadequate at times.
[Saphir] 
Hehe, didn't know Emblems got insecure. For 
what it's worth, I fight better with you here.

--- B ---

[Saphir] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Saphir] 
Must be nice to be an Emblem. Without a body, 
you never have to worry about getting old.
[Corrin] 
While that's true, aging is also part of what's 
beautiful about being human. I actually envy it.

--- A ---

[Saphir] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Saphir] 
You look so young, Corrin. I always forget that 
you're actually much older than me.
[Corrin] 
I suppose I've existed in this world for a long 
time. I've spent most of it in slumber, though.
[Saphir] 
Time changes you even if you sleep through it. 
So I guess you're kinda like a big sister to me.
[Corrin] 
Haha, I don't mind that. After all this time, I'd 
love to have a new sibling to look after.

=== Corrin & Seadall ===

--- C ---

[Seadall] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Seadall] 
I'm so grateful you rescued me at the fortress. 
If I may, I'd like to repay you with a dance.
[Corrin] 
I was glad I could be of help. And I would love 
to see you dance, Seadall.

--- B ---

[Seadall] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Seadall] 
Being a dancer used to be enough for me. But 
thanks to you, I see I want to be a protector too.
[Corrin] 
That's lovely, but the beauty of your dance 
saves people in more ways than you know.

--- A ---

[Seadall] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Seadall] 
When I read your fortune, Le Choix comes up─ 
the Choice card. It suggests difficult decisions.
[Corrin] 
I've made hard choices, yes. And every choice 
I've made has come with sacrifice...and loss.
[Seadall] 
I made a choice at the fortress to join this fight. 
The risks are great, but it is the right path.
[Corrin] 
I'm glad you don't regret it. But if it ever seems 
like too much, know that I'm here for you.

=== Corrin & Alcryst ===

--- C ---

[Alcryst] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Alcryst] 
You're so strong, Lady Corrin─as expected of a 
dragon from another world. Next to you, I... I...
[Corrin] 
Don't be so down on yourself, Alcryst. We held 
our own in the last battle, didn't we?

--- B ---

[Alcryst] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Alcryst] 
You shouldn't stare at me, Lady Corrin... It's a 
waste of time to scrutinize a lost cause like me.
[Corrin] 
I'm only worried. You remind me of my younger 
brother...and, just like him, you matter to me.

--- A ---

[Alcryst] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
You always envy other people, Alcryst, but I 
actually envy you in many ways.
[Corrin] 
I often wish I was a regular human like you. 
Alas, I was fated to be this way.
[Alcryst] 
I was unaware of your burden, Lady Corrin. 
My envy made me thoughtless. I apologize.
[Alcryst] 
It will take me some time, but...with you by my 
side, I feel like I can learn to fight with pride.

=== Corrin & Amber ===

--- C ---

[Amber] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Amber] 
My home was a quiet alpaca ranch surrounded 
by cliffs. What was your home like, Corrin?
[Corrin] 
I had two homes, one covered in darkness, the 
other bathed in light... Wait, what's an alpaca?

--- B ---

[Amber] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Amber] 
Alpacas are the best! They have four legs, long 
necks, fluffy wool all over their bodies...
[Corrin] 
If you exclude the fluff, that sounds like me in 
my dragon form. How big are their wings?

--- A ---

[Amber] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Amber] 
OK, so alpacas don't have wings...but if they 
did, I'm sure they'd be super cute.
[Corrin] 
You really love alpacas, don't you? Your eyes 
always light up when you talk about them.
[Amber] 
I do love them─a lot─but it helps that you're 
fun to talk to, Corrin!
[Corrin] 
Haha, I'm happy to hear that! I like talking to 
you too, Amber. You're a great ally.

=== Corrin & Vander ===

--- C ---

[Vander] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Vander] 
Your battle style does impress me. Yet in your 
human form, I find that I worry about you.
[Corrin] 
Oh? You remind me of my combat trainer, 
always keeping an eye on me.

--- B ---

[Vander] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I enjoy fighting by your side, Vander. It makes 
me feel like I'm the one being protected.
[Vander] 
What an honor to hear you say so, Lady Corrin. 
May we protect one another, always.

--- A ---

[Vander] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
You're always busy. If you tire, I can rub your 
shoulders. Or face. Whatever is customary here.
[Vander] 
Eh? Emblems cannot touch, can they? And rub 
my face? Is that common in your world?
[Corrin] 
Ah! Not common. Not really. Just sometimes. 
Depending on where you're from...
[Vander] 
Haha, Lady Corrin, the joy brought on by your 
offer has eased my fatigue plenty well.

=== Corrin & Veyle ===

--- C ---

[Veyle] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Veyle] 
You were amazing on the battlefield today. But, 
uh, do you mind hanging out a while longer?
[Corrin] 
Of course, Veyle, I'd love to. We so rarely get a 
chance to relax and chat with one another.

--- B ---

[Veyle] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I've enjoyed talking to you off the battlefield. 
I see now that you've needed company, Veyle.
[Veyle] 
I guess I have. I also just feel safe when I'm with 
you. Maybe it's because we're both dragons?

--- A ---

[Veyle] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
Veyle, you mentioned that we're both dragons, 
but do you ever turn into one?
[Veyle] 
I never want to be a dragon. I buried my 
dragonstone long ago. I don't know where it is.
[Corrin] 
You locked up your power to protect everyone? 
Oh, Veyle. I will be your dragon power.
[Veyle] 
If you're the source of my power, then I can be 
a good dragon. And that's all I've ever wanted.

=== Corrin & Yunaka ===

--- C ---

[Yunaka] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Gotta say, Corrin, I get a little starry-eyed 
hanging around with you.
[Corrin] 
Oh? You seem to be keeping your composure 
well enough, but I'm flattered nonetheless.

--- B ---

[Yunaka] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I wouldn't have guessed it by your usual cheer, 
but you're quite cool and calculating in battle.
[Yunaka] 
What? Me? Nah. That imagination's gotta be 
what makes you such a clever fighter though.

--- A ---

[Yunaka] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
I worry about you, Yunaka. Sometimes you 
seem to be...forcing yourself. Trying too hard.
[Yunaka] 
I appreciate the concern, Corrin. You're not 
wrong. There are times when I put up a front.
[Yunaka] 
But that front is just as real to me as the person 
I am underneath. And it's who I choose to be.
[Corrin] 
I respect that choice more than I can say. If it 
ever gets to be too much, please lean on me.

=== Corrin & Zelkov ===

--- C ---

[Zelkov] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Is there any endeavor outside of war that 
you pursue with *fervor,* Corrin?
[Corrin] 
Outside of war? That's a strange way to put it, 
but I suppose war can inspire a kind of fervor.

--- B ---

[Zelkov] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
Battle is a struggle of life and death. It demands 
you give your all, whether you want to or not.
[Zelkov] 
True. But giving your all is not what I mean 
by fervor. There must be *passion* involved.

--- A ---

[Zelkov] 1 
[Corrin] 2 

[Zelkov] 
I have killed many people. So many, in fact, that 
I sometimes feel *violence* is all I am good for.
[Corrin] 
If that were true, you would be a fundamentally 
bad person. I don't think that's the case.
[Zelkov] 
Your words are comforting, but I am afraid 
that is *precisely* the kind of person I am.
[Corrin] 
You have your other pursuits, right? You've 
taught me so much about having passion.
