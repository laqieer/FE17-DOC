[Alear] 
...
Not a nightmare... It was a memory...
Where am I?
Oh... I must have died protecting Veyle.
There's no waking up again this time.
I had dreamed I would awaken as a hero... Only 
now I realize, that did happen. But it's too late.
I wonder if I'll be able to find Mother here.

Mo...ther...
[Veyle] MPID Veyre 

[Veyle] 
...
[Alear] 
Veyle? Why are you here?
[Veyle] 
Papa used the rings to raise Gradlon.
The helmet reactivated, my head began to 
swim, and then...I was here.
Things didn't go how I wanted them to. And 
now it seems I've died.
[Alear] 
...
[Veyle] 
Papa said you're my big brother.
[Veyle] 
Papa said you're my big sister.
You gave your life to protect me. I'm so sorry. 
You should have let me die.
[Alear] 
Don't say that! I made the right choice.
You have a link back home. There's still a 
chance for you.
[Veyle] 
No... No more.
[Alear] 
What?
[Veyle] 
I tried so hard. I wanted Papa to look at me 
and not see a defect.
I wanted him to forget about the other worlds 
and just be with me.
I'd always think, "If only I tried harder..."
But it never mattered! I kept getting crushed 
over and over...
I'm so tired. If I have to die again and fail 
once more...
I'd rather it just end here─with you.
[Alear] 
Oh, Veyle...
[Veyle] 
Hey. Why don't we fall asleep...together? 
The world will end with or without us.
And...I feel happy because I finally found you. 
Maybe the others will join us eventually.
[Alear] 
Perhaps you're right.
[Veyle] 
Well, then...
[Alear] 
Except...I'm not ready to give up. I want to save 
our world and everyone I care about.
Veyle, you have been through so much, and 
I understand why you feel the way you do.
But please, don't give up. Not before you 
experience the life you deserve.
[Veyle] 
I don't care anymore. Even if I returned and 
survived all of it...
I can't stop Papa because I can't 
summon Emblems.
All I can do is create the Corrupted. A foul 
ability befitting a Fell Dragon.
[Alear] 
Corrupted...
Veyle, there is something you can do.
[Veyle] 
Huh?
[Alear] 
Revive me as one of the Corrupted.
[Veyle] 
What?!
[Alear] 
You did it to King Hyacinth. It was as if he'd 
come back to life─returned to himself.
Perhaps I could go back to the living world in 
the same way.
[Veyle] 
Maybe, but you aren't thinking this through!
You hate the Corrupted. They terrify you!
Now you want to be one? If we do that, you'll 
never be able to change back!
This way, at least you died as yourself. Would 
you really want to die as one of them?
[Alear] 
I'll sacrifice more than that if it saves everyone.
How I die doesn't matter. I just want to end 
this war. However I can.
[Veyle] 
...
[Alear] 
Please don't give up, Veyle. If we don't try, 
we lose everything.
To me, this is the only way forward.
[Veyle] 
But...
[Alear] 
Veyle... What do you live for?
[Veyle] 
What do you mean?
[Alear] 
My friends told me it doesn't matter where 
you're from. What's important is how you live.
How you live and what you do shapes your 
future. So...who do you want to become?
[Veyle] 
I've never thought about that.
But if it were possible for me to change now, 
I suppose...
I'd want to be like you. I'd want to become a 
dragon who saves the world.
[Alear] 
We really are siblings.
[Veyle] 
Hm?
[Alear] 
I said something very similar a long time ago.
Let's go back and save our world. Together.
[Veyle] 
All right.
I'll give it one last try. I hope to see you 
soon, brother.
I'll give it one last try. I hope to see you 
soon, sister.
[Alear] 
You're my dear sister, and I trust you with all of 
my heart.

Hahaha!
Stop fighting. You die either way!
[Mauvier] 1 
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle, please. Come back to us!
[Veyle] 黒 悪 
Aww, you miss her, Mauvier? Then I'll kill 
you first.
Maybe you'll find what you're after on the 
other side.

I know that my sister believed in me. So I... 
I believe in myself!
Shut your mouth! You are nothing but a defect!
Mark my words, you quivering little baby! 
You're gonna be dead soon!
No! I won't! You're not in control here, I am!
And I won't wear this horrible thing anymore!
Wait!
There's already a crack in it. I'll break it!
Then I get to be me again. You'll be gone!
Stop...stop it right now!
I don't want to go! Help me, Father! I beg of you!
Papa isn't coming. He doesn't care. It's time now.
Time to say goodbye.
Ngh... Ah! Aaaaah!


[Mauvier] 1 
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle!
[Veyle] 
Mauvier. It's all right. I'm myself again.
[Mauvier] 
I wish...I could have done something. I'm so sorry. 
But you did it all on your own.
[Veyle] 
You're wrong about me doing it alone. 
My brother helped me.
[Veyle] 
You're wrong about me doing it alone. 
My sister helped me.
[Mauvier] 
The Divine Dragon?
[Mauvier] 

[Veyle] 
I have to hurry.
Guardians of the underworld, cast aside the rules 
that govern life and death...
so that this body, void of life...may draw breath!
Rise up! Corrupted !

The Divine One has become corrupted...

[Timerra] 
What are we supposed to do now? Fight?
[Timerra] 
[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
No... We can't.
[Alear] 
Please, everyone. Listen.
[Diamant] 
You can speak?
[Alear] 
There's nothing to fear. I won't hurt you.
I asked Veyle to revive me as one of 
the Corrupted.
You must believe me.
[Diamant] 
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
But are you really...you?
[Alear] 
Yes. I'm the same person who took this journey 
with you─the Divine Dragon .
Whatever form I take, this soul is still mine.
[Alfred] 
...
[Alfred] 

[Veyle] 
Brother, look what I found.
[Alfred] 

[Veyle] 
Sister, look what I found.
[Alear] 
The Ring of the Hero-King...
[Veyle] 
It was lying by your side...as though it wanted 
to be with you.
The Emblems in the 12 rings have played their 
roles. They are likely drained of power.
Can you still summon them?
[Alear] 
You've done so much today. Now it's my turn.
[Veyle] 
All right.
[Alear] 
Marth. I've returned. I'm here for you. Please 
show yourself.
Shine on, Emblem of Beginnings!
...
[Veyle] 
Nothing happened.
[Veyle] 

[Alear] 
...
No. This has to work. We have so much 
to protect.
Please, Marth. Join me once more!
Shine on, Emblem of Beginnings!
[Marth] 3 
[Marth] 
...
[Alear] 
Marth!
I'm so happy to see you!
[Marth] 
...
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
But...that's the Fell Dragon version.
[Alfred] 
[Veyle] 4 

[Veyle] 
I used Fell Dragon power to raise my brother. 
He's using that same power to summon.
[Alfred] 
[Veyle] 4 

[Veyle] 
I used Fell Dragon power to raise my sister. 
She's using that same power to summon.
[Marth]

[Corrupted] [Warrior] 
RAAARGH!
[Veyle] 
[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
What happened? Are they reacting to 
the Emblem?
[Alear] 
Time is short. I'll need your help to summon 
all the Emblems again.
You don't have to trust me, but this is the 
only way.
We must stand together and fight as one!

[Alear] 1 
[Veyle] 3 

[Alear] 
That's it. I've summoned the Emblems, and 
we've fended off our enemies.
[Veyle] 
What a relief.
[Alfred] 2 
[Alfred] 
I think I'd better apologize. To both of you.
[Alear] 
What for?
[Alfred] 
Doubting what you said.
I thought this was all one of Sombron's tricks─ 
a way to turn us against each other.
But when we fought together, I knew it was 
you. Our ally. Our friend.
[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
Corrupted or not, I am glad you returned.
[Alear] 
Thank you all for placing your trust in me.
[Alfred] 

[Timerra] 2 

[Timerra] 
And thanks to Lady Veyle! We couldn't have 
won without you.
[Ivy] 
[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
Yes. Wresting back control of yourself, reviving 
the Divine Dragon... You did much today.
If not for your efforts, we'd probably be dead.
[Veyle] 
Thank you. I did what I could.
[Diamant] 

[Alear] 

[Veyle] 
[Veyle] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Now we're all together again...
...
[Veyle] 
What's the matter?
[Alear] 
I can't move...
[Veyle] 
What? No...
[Alear] 
I'm vanishing.
[Veyle] 
I knew this was a risk, but it wasn't supposed 
to happen so soon.
I gave you all the power I could. It should have 
been enough.
Unless... Oh no. Summoning the Emblems must 
have drained you.
[Alear] 
I didn't realize.
[Veyle] 
It's all right. I'll try again. Hang on!
Guardians of the underworld, cast aside the 
rules that govern life and death...
[Alear] 
...
[Veyle] 
Your body is rejecting my power! It can't 
take anymore...
[Alear] 
Thank you for trying, Veyle. But it seems my 
time has come.
[Veyle] 
...
[Alear] 
It's all right. The 12 Emblems are here.
With their help, I know you'll be able to 
stop Sombron.
[Veyle] 
No! You can't leave! You said we'd save the 
world together!
[Alear] 
I'm sorry. You'll have to do that without me.
At least I was useful in the end. I can die 
knowing you're all safe.
If only I could fight to the end with you, 
my friends...
[Veyle] 
Brother!
[Veyle] 
Sister!
[Alear] 
We got the rings back. We're all together.
I wish I could have finished the mission Mother 
gave me...
I wish I could see the world come to peace. 
But all I see is...
[Alear] 
Light?
[Veyle] 

不明 1 
不明 
Dragon child. You desire the power to fight... 
to the end, alongside everyone.
[Alear] 
Marth?

[Alear] 2 
[Veyle] 1 
[Alfred] 3 
[Alfred] 
The 12 Emblems must have granted 
their power...
[Veyle] 
Beautiful...
[Veyle] 
[Alfred] 

[Alear] 
How did this...
[Lumera] 1 

[Lumera] 
Before your slumber, I made you a promise.
I said I'd give you a birthday present that suited 
you perfectly.
I always knew this day would come.
A very happy birthday to you, .
[Lumera] 

[Alear] 
So, this ring...
[Marth] 1 
[Marth] 
That has become your Emblem Ring, 
.
[Alear] 
Marth!
[Marth] 
Lumera's power was held in that ring. You have 
restored the power of the Divine Dragon.
She must have known this day would come─ 
the day of your rebirth.
[Alear] 
I was dead... And now, look at me, I feel...new. 
What do you mean, "Emblem Ring"?
[Marth] 
Your life was saved by the combined power of 
12 rings, making you the thirteenth Emblem.
The Fire Emblem.
[Alear] 
I'm the thirteenth Emblem? The Fire Emblem?
[Marth] 
[Celica] 1 
[Celica] 
That's right, .
And that is your Emblem Ring, much like the 
rings that house our spirits.
[Celica] 
[Sigurd] 1 

[Sigurd] 
We Emblems have only ever been spirits. 
But you had a physical form...
Perhaps this is now why you seem unique 
among us.
[Alear] 
And it's like I was never Corrupted!
[Sigurd] 
[Leif] 1 
[Leif] 
Your power as an Emblem dwells in the ring, 
just as dragons imbue their power into stones.
Though you died, you are now reborn as an 
Emblem with a new body.
[Alear] 
But...how?
Sombron used your power. I thought you could 
only grant it once every thousand years.
[Leif] 

[Roy] 1 
[Roy] 
The 12 rings have another power. One we 
kept secret.
[Alear] 
And what's that?
[Roy] 

[Lyn] 1 
[Lyn] 
Now that you're an Emblem, we can finally 
reveal the truth.
[Lyn] 

[Eirika] 1 

[Eirika] 
We have always been able to perform the 
miracle at any time.
[Eirika] 
[Ike] 1 
[Ike] 
To use it, we all had to be together and agree 
on who deserved the miracle.
[Alear] 
So that means, I...
[Ike] 
[Micaiah] 1 
[Micaiah] 
Yes. We all agreed we wished to fight alongside 
you, .
[Micaiah] 
[Byleth] 1 
[Byleth] 
We could do this once and never again. Not in 
all the thousands of years ahead.
[Byleth] 
[Lucina] 1 
[Lucina] 
What's more, this will be the last gift that we 
will ever give this world.
[Lucina] 
[Corrin] 1 
[Corrin] 
This took all of our future power. It was worth it 
to fight alongside you now.
[Corrin] 
[Marth] 1 
[Marth] 
This is the first time we Emblems have shared 
the same wish─for this, for you.
[Alear] 
Everyone, you...
[Marth] 
This was the only way we could save you. 
No one returns from death.
Now, being an Emblem is perhaps not what you 
desired. I hope we have done the right thing.
[Alear] 
I've died twice. I didn't expect to be back again. 
So, thank you!
My friends and I will do our best to protect this 
world. I'll make the most of what you've done.
Oh, and Marth...
I'm so glad to see you again.
I'm sorry we were separated in Elusia. It's been 
so long since then...
[Marth] 
Oh, it was barely a blink, compared to your 
years of slumber.
It's good to see you, my fellow Emblem.
[Alear] 
Ha! Yes, my fellow Emblem.
[Marth] 
[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
Glad to have you back, Divine One.
[Timerra] 3 

[Timerra] 
Don't even think about dying again! You 
hear me?
[Alfred] 

[Vander] 1 

[Vander] 
I don't think I could survive losing you 
a third time.
[Timerra] 
[Ivy] 3 

[Ivy] 
How I prayed at the end...to be with you again. 
We all were, and now, here we are.
[Vander] 
[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
And you're an Emblem. I look forward to seeing 
what you can do.
[Alear] 
I'm sorry I worried you all.
I'm not going anywhere ever again. I am with 
you now, all the way to the end.
[Diamant] 

[Ivy] 
[Veyle] 1 

[Veyle] 
Now we'll always be together!
[Alear] 
Veyle, without you, I wouldn't be here.
Thank you.
[Veyle] 
No... You saved my life, too, remember?
I should be thanking you.
[Alear] 
What is this? An earthquake?!
[Marth] 3 
[Marth] 
No. This is something far different. A greater 
force is in motion.
Something is happening in Gradlon.
[Veyle] 
Let's look.

[Alear] 2 
[Marth] 4 
[Veyle] 1 

[Alear] 
What in the world? What's all that in the 
middle of the sea?
[Veyle] 
Gradlon... It's back...
[Marth] 
A portal is opening in the sky. Soon, Sombron 
will set out to invade other worlds.
[Alear] 
We have to stop him.
[Marth] 
I wish we could, but there's a barrier in the way.
[Veyle] 
Yes, and it's covering the entire continent. 
The power that must have taken...
Papa doesn't want us to interfere with 
his plans.
[Alear] 
How do we break through?
[Marth] 
We will need to destroy the Fell Dragon Shards 
that are sustaining the barrier.
But I don't know where to find them.
[Veyle] 
I can help.
[Alear] 
You can?
[Veyle] 
I feel...I guess you'd call it a vortex of Fell 
Dragon power building up in Gradlon.
I think there are two of them... No. Three. 
Follow me.
[Alear] 
We'll destroy the Fell Dragon Shards and 
shatter the barrier. To Gradlon!

Ugh... I am your father. How dare you turn 
your sword on me!
You mean to strike me down?
Go on, do it!
[Lumera] 
Why are you here all by yourself?!
[Alear] 
The war is finally over, Mother. We don't have 
to worry any─
Ah!
[Sombron] 
Die, treacherous whelp...
[Lumera] 
No...

I guess Fell Dragons have to die in the end... 
But I wanted to be...a good dragon.
[Lumera] 
And you will! Someday life will return to you.

I will give you a birthday gift that suits you perfectly.

Thank you, Mother...
If I see that day...
maybe I'll return...dressed in white...a gleaming 
sword at my side...
A Divine Dragon, like you... Ready to save the world.

Dragon child, you who fought bravely, even after death...
Would you rise once more?
I want to fight. It can't end here.
No matter how hard it may be, I have to 
continue until the world is safe.
I must fight...like the Emblems have!
I have heard your wish. And thus, our power is yours.
