[Fogado] 
Hmm... What to do, what to do...
[Etie] 
About what, Prince Fogado?
[Fogado] 
Ah, it's nothing serious. I'm just struggling to 
come up with ideas for my next party.
[Fogado] 
I want to do something that puts a smile on 
everyone's face, but it's a little tricky.
[Etie] 
What's so hard about a party?
[Fogado] 
Well, you know, there aren't many bands 
available for gigs in wartime.
[Fogado] 
Plus our budget's really limited, so there's not 
much room for error.
[Etie] 
Huh. I hadn't thought about all that, but you've 
got a point.
[Fogado] 
Oh, what if we have a dessert party? Get 
together and just eat some sweet treats.
[Etie] 
Desserts are the opposite of a party.
[Fogado] 
Huh... I've never met anyone who hated dessert.
[Etie] 
Hate's a strong word. I just love my muscles too 
much to load up on empty calories like that.
[Etie] 
What do you say to a workout party instead?
[Fogado] 
What kind of party is that?
[Etie] 
It's where a bunch of people get together and 
do nothing but tone their muscles.
[Fogado] 
Huh. Interesting...suggestion, but I don't think 
that would be everyone's cup of tea.
[Etie] 
You don't think so?
[Fogado] 
Nah. I'll keep brainstorming. Thanks though.

[Etie] 
Prince Fogado, any new party ideas?
[Fogado] 
Ugh, no. It's been a bumpy road.
[Fogado] 
I considered doing a feast of meats, but most 
meals have meat, so that's not special.
[Fogado] 
Then I thought, maybe a vegetarian feast, 
but Timerra shot that down.
[Fogado] 
Finally I realized, maybe we just do drinks. 
But then...what if people get hungry?!
[Fogado] 
Why does it have to be so complicated?
[Etie] 
I have two words for you─muscle stimulants.
[Fogado] 
Is that the stuff you're always drinking?
[Etie] 
Yep. Every musclehead swears by them.
[Fogado] 
Nope, nope, nope. That is not gonna work.
[Etie] 
Why not?
[Fogado] 
Come on─it's medicine! It probably tastes... 
well, like medicine.
[Etie] 
Oh, so you've tried it?
[Fogado] 
No, but─
[Etie] 
Then how could you possibly know?
[Fogado] 
Well, I... Yeah, I guess you got me there.
[Fogado] 
But still. You think it'll be fun for people to just 
hang out and...drink workout juice?
[Etie] 
Haha! Oh, Prince Fogado. You really 
are clueless.
[Etie] 
Muscle stimulants taste like medicine. You really 
think we drink them raw every day?
[Fogado] 
I mean... Yeah, kinda.
[Etie] 
I've got the makings of an idea for your party. 
Give me some time to put muscle on its bones.
[Fogado] 
All right, then. I'm waiting with bated breath.

[Etie] 
Thanks for showing up, Prince Fogado.
[Etie] 
Today I'm gonna give you a taste of the infinite 
potential hidden in muscle stimulants.
[Etie] 
Try this one first.
[Fogado] 
Wow, these look delicious!
[Etie] 
Heh. I've got dried fruitcake, honey pie, some 
camel-milk mousse, and these pastries.
[Etie] 
All of them feature my muscle stimulants as 
a key ingredient.
[Fogado] 
What?!
[Fogado] 
You put your muscle stuff in all of these?
[Etie] 
Every one. But don't just stand there and stare. 
Taste them for yourself.
[Fogado] 
All right. Down the hatch...
[Fogado] 
...
[Fogado] 
That's...that's really good! It's sweet, but not so 
sweet that it overpowers the other flavors.
[Etie] 
I replaced the sugar in that one with some 
sweet-tasting muscle stimulant.
[Etie] 
That way, I can eat all I want without worrying 
about losing muscle tone.
[Fogado] 
Wow, delicious and healthy, to boot. I might 
have to serve these at my next party after all.
[Fogado] 
It's a totally fresh idea too. Folks can chow 
down and train up at the same time.
[Etie] 
Told you so.
[Fogado] 
I'd better start planning. You wanna help, Etie? 
It was your idea, after all.
[Etie] 
Absolutely. On one condition.
[Etie] 
First we run 10 laps around the Somniel. Then 
1,000 push-ups, 1,000 sit-ups, and after that...
[Fogado] 
Wha─ Hey, hold on! Why do I have to do 
all that?
[Etie] 
You're the host. You should be pushing your 
body's limits, like a real musclehead.
[Etie] 
That way, you'll have the firsthand experience 
you need to host the party right.
[Fogado] 
OK... But don't push me too hard, all right? 
I've never done this before.
[Etie] 
Gotcha. I'll push you just hard enough that you 
don't croak.
[Fogado] 
Whoa, whoa! A little gentler than that, if you 
don't mind.
