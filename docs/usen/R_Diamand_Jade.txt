[Jade] 
...
[Diamant] 
Anything to report?
[Jade] 
Oh. Prince Diamant.
[Jade] 
No news here. It's a quiet night.
[Diamant] 
I see.
[Jade] 
Standing guard like this reminds me of the 
other day...
[Diamant] 
Which day?
[Jade] 
The day of that snowstorm. I was guarding the 
Elusia border through most of it.
[Diamant] 
Right. That storm was awful.
[Jade] 
It was snowing so heavily... I worried that I 
wouldn't be able to find you.
[Diamant] 
So did I.
[Jade] 
Huh?
[Diamant] 
I feared I might lose a trusted retainer to the 
cold. I almost worried myself sick.
[Diamant] 
When I finally arrived and saw you were still 
standing strong, I breathed such a sigh of relief.
[Jade] 
Oh. Well. Let's not get carried away...but thank 
you for your concern, Prince Diamant.
[Diamant] 
Dawn should break any minute. I'll relieve you 
a bit early. Go get some sleep, OK?
[Jade] 
Understood.
[Diamant] 
Good work tonight. Oh, and I'm excited to read 
your new chapters. Will they be ready soon?
[Jade] 
Yes. Without delay.

[Diamant] 
Hahaha!
[Diamant] 
Haha, I can't─ I can't stop... Haha! 
Aah, my sides!
[Jade] 
Prince Diamant, are you OK?
[Diamant] 
Am I OK? You almost killed me! Your writing is 
hazardous to my health, Jade.
[Jade] 
It's an unexpected honor to have my storytelling 
threaten a crown prince's life.
[Jade] 
Which part are you on?
[Diamant] 
Chapter 19 of "The Adventures of Amber, the 
Deliberate Dummy."
[Jade] 
Ah. So you're at the part where Amber just won 
the fighting tournament?
[Diamant] 
Yes! And he returned to his hometown to 
celebrate his victory, but no one believed him!
[Diamant] 
And then the scene where he rides his mighty 
alpaca through the open fields to dry his tears...
[Jade] 
As soon as he dismounts, his eyes finally dry... 
the alpaca spits right in his face. Poor Amber.
[Diamant] 
This isn't just a funny novel, Jade. This book 
is art.
[Diamant] 
Tell me, when will the next one be ready?
[Jade] 
Well...I wanted to talk to you about that. I might 
take a break from writing. Just for a while.
[Diamant] 
Oh. Really?
[Diamant] 
I think I understand. Our battles are growing 
more intense. Not much we can do about that.
[Jade] 
Yes. That's certainly a factor, but...
[Jade] 
Lately, no matter what I write...it all feels flat 
to me. I'm bored by my own ideas.
[Diamant] 
Ah. So you're in a bit of a slump?
[Jade] 
Yes. I need to rest my pen for a while. I'm sorry 
if this news disappoints you, Prince Diamant.
[Diamant] 
No need to apologize. I'm an eager, yet patient, 
reader. Take as long as you need.
[Jade] 
Thank you very much. If I start writing again, 
I'll let you know.
[Diamant] 
If anything, I'm glad to hear you'll be giving 
yourself a break. In the meantime...
[Diamant] 
Why don't I write the next book?
[Jade] 
Huh?
[Diamant] 
Don't worry. I won't step on your work. It'll be 
more like a...side story. I'd enjoy the challenge.
[Jade] 
Uh... You're serious about this?
[Diamant] 
I'm always serious. I'll let you know when it's 
done. You just relax until then.
[Jade] 
Yes. Understood...

[Diamant] 
Jade! I finished my first draft. Care to give it 
a read?
[Diamant] 
It's titled, "The EXTRA Adventures of Amber, 
the Deliberate Dummy."
[Jade] 
You... You actually wrote it...
[Jade] 
Yes. Of course, Prince Diamant. I would...love 
to read it.
[Diamant] 
...
[Jade] 
Hm, this is pretty funny. However...
[Diamant] 
Be honest. Don't hold back.
[Jade] 
These pages might benefit from a few more 
gags. If you revised this scene just a bit...
[Diamant] 
Hmm. What would you change?
[Jade] 
If I were writing it...I'd have all of the alpaca's 
wool explode off of its body.
[Diamant] 
Haha.
[Jade] 
And then, just as Amber composes himself, its 
wool grows back in a flash─silky and smooth.
[Jade] 
Amber tries to mount his alpaca, but its wool is 
so smooth that he slips─no, shoots right off.
[Jade] 
As Amber soars through the air and over the 
horizon...his alpaca wistfully spits at the ground.
[Diamant] 
...
[Diamant] 
Hahaha!
[Diamant] 
That's perfect! Your version flows much better.
[Jade] 
Thank you. But the larger framework of your 
story is quite good, Prince Diamant.
[Jade] 
I'd love to give you further notes once you 
have your second draft ready.
[Diamant] 
No, I'm done.
[Jade] 
Huh?! Why did you crumple your draft?
[Diamant] 
It served its purpose. Sounds like your new 
book is well on its way.
[Jade] 
My new book?
[Diamant] 
Sure. Your silky-smooth wool idea was superb. 
I trust you'll pick things up from there.
[Jade] 
Wait. Did you...
[Jade] 
Were you just trying to lift me out of my slump? 
By kicking off a first draft for me?
[Diamant] 
Are you suggesting that I wrote a weak draft 
on purpose? I'm not that clever.
[Diamant] 
I gave it my best effort. My jokes just couldn't 
stand against those of a true artist.
[Jade] 
Prince Diamant.
[Jade] 
You may deny that was your plan, but...
[Jade] 
Thank you.
[Diamant] 
All right. Almost time to get back to work.
[Diamant] 
Don't worry about tonight's watch, Jade. I can 
handle it myself.
[Jade] 
But...
[Diamant] 
You've been fighting extra hard lately. I'm sure 
that contributed to your slump. Get some rest.
[Diamant] 
And whenever that book is ready, let me know. 
Nothing relaxes me like laughing at your writing.
[Jade] 
Understood. Thank you very much.
[Jade] 
As long as I'm your retainer, Prince Diamant...
[Jade] 
I vow to protect every bone in your body. 
Especially the funny one.
