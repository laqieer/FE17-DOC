=== Chloé & Hortensia ===
--- C ---


[Hortensia]
Hmm...
[Chloé]
What's wrong, Princess Hortensia?
[Hortensia]
Yeah, I get it now...
[Hortensia]
You've got a whole other kind of charm.
[Chloé]
I do?
[Hortensia]
Yeah. It's like an aura of sophistication.
Maturity! Like you could be anyone's mom.
[Hortensia]
I like that. I want it. I've already mastered
cuteness. I need to add to my repertoire.
[Hortensia]
I mean, I'm sure I'll develop an aura of maternal
sophistication as I get older...
[Hortensia]
But why should I have to wait? You have it now,
so I should have it now too.
[Chloé]
I guess so...
[Hortensia]
I'm glad you agree, Chloé─because I demand
you accompany me. For observation.
[Hortensia]
Once I see how it's done, I'll be able to steal...
I mean learn...the technique myself.
[Chloé]
I'm not sure that's how it works, but OK.
[Chloé]
I'm honored if someone as cute as you thinks
I'm sophisticated, though.
[Hortensia]
Excellent. Wait, really?
[Hortensia]
You don't mind that I just up and demanded
this out of the blue?
[Chloé]
Oh, no! I don't mind at all. It's all part of
your cuteness.
[Hortensia]
See, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
How do you do that?
--- B ---


[Hortensia]
So...maternal sophistication is all about gently
embracing everyone. Drawing them to you.
[Hortensia]
I get how it works, but actually pulling it off
is something else entirely.
[Hortensia]
I've just gotta keep observing you. I'll learn all
your tricks eventually.
[Chloé]
Whatever I can do to help. I hope it works.
[Chloé]
Oh, but wait. Before we get started...
[Chloé]
Let me wipe your face.
[Hortensia]
Ugh... Did I have something on me?
[Chloé]
You did, but I took care of it. Now that cute
face of yours is even cuter!
[Hortensia]
Hehe, thanks, Chloé!
[Hortensia]
Wait...
[Hortensia]
...
[Hortensia]
That was it! That was it, just now!
[Hortensia]
I just naturally trusted you and let you wipe my
face without even thinking about it.
[Hortensia]
Having you dote on me felt...I dunno, peaceful.
[Chloé]
Aww, did it? That's so sweet.
[Hortensia]
Hehe, unbelievable. I can't let my guard down
around you at all!
[Hortensia]
Anyway, let's get moving. I need to see more of
this in action.
[Chloé]
Be sure to drink some water first.
[Hortensia]
Huh? Why?
[Chloé]
On a warm day like today, it's important to
drink when you can.
[Hortensia]
Oh, sure.
[Hortensia]
Glug glug...
[Hortensia]
Wait a second!
[Hortensia]
I fell for it again! Your motherly charm is kind
of terrifying, Chloé...

[Hortensia]
Oh─ Chloé...
[Chloé]
Hello, Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia]
Yeah, hi. Um, see you later...
[Chloé]
Sorry, it's just a small thing.
[Hortensia]
Wh-what is it?
[Chloé]
Is it my imagination or are you avoiding me?
[Hortensia]
Was it that obvious?
[Chloé]
Did I offend you somehow? I'd like to know
what I did to drive you away.
[Hortensia]
...
[Hortensia]
When I'm around you, I keep thinking about...
what I don't have.
[Hortensia]
I mean like your maturity and sophistication and
all that stuff.
[Hortensia]
I didn't want to think about it anymore, so
I just...stayed away from you.
[Chloé]
Hmm, OK. Thanks for letting me know.
[Chloé]
But I still want to be better friends with you.
[Hortensia]
You do?
[Chloé]
You have to expect that every person
is different.
[Chloé]
I know you've said that you wish you had my
"maternal sophistication."
[Chloé]
But there are a lot of things you have going for
you that I don't.
[Chloé]
I'm starting to wish I had more of your special
charms too, Princess Hortensia.
[Hortensia]
Oh... Chloé...
[Hortensia]
That makes me so happy!
[Hortensia]
I'm so sorry. I promise I'll stop avoiding you.
[Hortensia]
In fact, let's hang out even more than before.
There's so much we can learn from each other!
[Chloé]
That would be great! You can show me how
you got to be so cute.
[Hortensia]
Yeah! And once I've learned all I can from you,
I'm gonna be unstoppable.
[Chloé]
Haha, I'm sure you'll catch on in no time.
[Chloé]
But first, let me wipe your nose for you.
[Hortensia]
Oh, thanks!
[Hortensia]
Wait, my nose was running?
