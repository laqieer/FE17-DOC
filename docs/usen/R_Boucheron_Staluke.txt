[Alcryst] 
Hello, Boucheron. May I have a moment of 
your time?
[Boucheron] 
What can I do for you, Prince Alcryst?
[Alcryst] 
I... I came here to beg you to be my coach!
[Boucheron] 
What?!
[Alcryst] 
Ah. You're right. I would make a horrible 
student. It was selfish of me to even ask.
[Boucheron] 
No, that's not... I just meant to ask, what could 
I possibly teach you?
[Alcryst] 
Well, I... I was hoping you could teach me how 
to build a physique like yours.
[Boucheron] 
Oh, you want to bulk up, huh?
[Alcryst] 
I know I lack confidence. It occurred to me that 
my weak frame might be a part of that.
[Alcryst] 
Then I began to picture myself with some 
actual muscles, and...well...
[Boucheron] 
Heh, I get it. You want to build muscle as a 
way of building confidence.
[Boucheron] 
Sure. I'd be happy to give you some pointers.
[Alcryst] 
You will? Oh, that's wonderful! Thank you, 
Boucheron!
[Alcryst] 
I'm so honored that you're willing to take a 
hopeless case like me under your wing.
[Alcryst] 
Compared to you, I'm just so...
[Boucheron] 
OK, my first tip is to stop saying stuff like that! 
Pull yourself together!
[Alcryst] 
It's OK. You need not console me. Just know 
that I am worthless putty in your capable hands.
[Boucheron] 
I think I'm starting to see the bigger hurdles in 
your path.

[Boucheron] 
Seven! Eight! Nine!
[Alcryst] 
I─ I can't do any more!
[Boucheron] 
What's wrong, Prince Alcyrst? That was only 
nine push-ups.
[Boucheron] 
You still have 91 more to go!
[Alcryst] 
...
[Boucheron] 
Was one hundred too much to shoot for at first? 
Should we bring it down to ten?
[Alcryst] 
No, don't do that. That would dismiss one of 
the zeroes from the target number.
[Alcryst] 
I'd feel awful for that poor zero, cut from the 
team because of a weakling like me...
[Boucheron] 
OK. Let's come back to push-ups later and 
move on to sit-ups for now.
[Alcryst] 
Oh. All right... How many sit-ups should I do?
[Boucheron] 
A hundred.
[Alcryst] 
Did you say one hundred?!
[Alcryst] 
No. I can't back out or give up. I have to build 
muscles and grow more confident!
[Boucheron] 
That's the spirit! Let's get started!
[Boucheron] 
One! Two! Three!
[Alcryst] 
F-four! Ugh! I can't do any more! My sides are 
being torn apart!
[Boucheron] 
Um, Prince Alcryst. You're 96 short of 
your goal.
[Alcryst] 
I want to make it to one hundred─I really, truly 
do─but my body just can't do it...
[Boucheron] 
Hmm... That's a problem, all right.
[Boucheron] 
Why don't we take a quick break? Let me know 
when you've recovered.
[Alcryst] 
All right. OK... Ow, ow, ow...

[Boucheron] 
Ninety-eight! Ninety-nine! One hundred!
[Alcryst] 
Ah, I did it!
[Boucheron] 
You did it, Prince Alcryst! You hit one hundred!
[Alcryst] 
Wow. I can't believe it! I'm so happy!
[Boucheron] 
I always knew you could. How do you feel? 
Think you've gained any muscle?
[Alcryst] 
Yes, a little bit. If I flex here, I can feel the 
muscle tighten up.
[Boucheron] 
Wonderful! And does that help your confidence?
[Alcryst] 
Not in the slightest.
[Boucheron] 
Oh...
[Alcryst] 
I apologize, Boucheron.
[Alcryst] 
You wasted your precious time on a lost cause.
[Boucheron] 
You really shouldn't talk like that.
[Alcryst] 
I still can't compare to my brother, Diamant. 
He's so incredible, and I'm so...so...
[Boucheron] 
Where does this come from?
[Alcryst] 
It's been that way since I was a kid...or, at least, 
that's what people have always told me.
[Boucheron] 
Well, no wonder you don't have any confidence 
if that's what you've always heard.
[Boucheron] 
Look, Prince Alcryst. I'm not always so 
confident either.
[Alcryst] 
Really? Even though you were blessed with an 
incredible physique?
[Boucheron] 
My muscles are well-developed, but inside, I'm 
a softie with a terrible sense of direction.
[Boucheron] 
You know what people used to call me? 
"Big Crybaby" and "Wrong-Way Strong."
[Alcryst] 
I don't believe it.
[Boucheron] 
There are some things I'm self-conscious about. 
But I still get by.
[Boucheron] 
Sometimes I wonder if there's anyone in the 
world with true, unshakable confidence.
[Boucheron] 
I bet even Prince Diamant has his doubts 
about himself.
[Alcryst] 
Even my brother?
[Alcryst] 
Haha, such supportive words for a scrawny 
pipsqueak like me. I appreciate it.
[Boucheron] 
Ah, think nothing of it. I'd do the same for any 
of my best students.
[Alcryst] 
I believe it.
[Boucheron] 
You should keep working out. I'd be happy to 
coach you anytime.
[Alcryst] 
I will. Thank you, Coach Boucheron.
[Boucheron] 
Heh heh, the honor is all mine, Prince Alcryst.
