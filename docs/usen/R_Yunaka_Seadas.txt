=== Yunaka & Seadall ===
--- C ---



[Seadall]
Yunaka, I heard a rumor that you're very good
at doing impressions. Is that true?
[Yunaka]
Zappy! I do them from time to time, for a giggle.
[Yunaka]
Want a demonstration? Here goes.
[Yunaka]
"I am Emblem Corrin. I'll fight with all I have!"
[Yunaka]
Or how about...
[Yunaka]
"I am Ivy, crown princess of Elusia."
[Yunaka]
You get the idea.
[Seadall]
Finally...I've found you.
[Yunaka]
You were looking?
[Seadall]
Yunaka, please, I need you to join me on stage.
[Yunaka]
By "stage," I take it you mean...the kind where
you get in front of people and sing and dance?
[Seadall]
Exactly that kind.
[Seadall]
I've been choreographing a stage play, and I am
in need of an actor.
[Yunaka]
Ah! Nope! I can't do it! What you're describing
is totally impossible.
[Seadall]
I'll guide you through it. I swear, I won't let this
be a bad experience for you.
[Seadall]
Please, Yunaka. I can't make this performance
happen without you.
[Yunaka]
Heh, you sound so sure...
[Yunaka]
If that's really how you feel about it...I guess
I can give it a try.
[Seadall]
Thank you.
[Yunaka]
Just remember, if it turns out I'm terrible at this,
I did warn you.
[Seadall]
I promise you, there won't be any blame...
only gratitude.
[Seadall]
I know what I've just seen. A gifted performer in
the making.

[Seadall]
Please, find it in your heart to stay. Let me
dance by your side forever...
[Yunaka]
Please don't hold me back. It will only serve to
sharpen the pain of our parting.
[Seadall]
My eyes are closed.
[Seadall]
My hand is here. If you trust me, then take it...
and never let go.
[Yunaka]
...
[Yunaka]
If you're certain this is what you want...
I'm willing to believe in you.
[Yunaka]
So long as we're together, from now until
the end...
[Seadall]
...
[Seadall]
Your performance...the nuance and honesty...
I was right. You are gifted. More than I knew.
[Yunaka]
Aaah, I'm not so sure. I really don't have any
experience with acting. This is all so new to me!
[Seadall]
Yunaka, your impressions are brilliant...
because you're a brilliant actor.
[Seadall]
And this show will be unforgettable because
you will be an unforgettable lead.
[Yunaka]
I'm playing the lead?!
[Seadall]
Well, I thought I'd be the lead. But now I know
better. That role was meant for you.
[Seadall]
We still have to practice the dance, but I have
no doubt you can handle it, Yunaka.
[Seadall]
It's not easy putting on a show when times are
hard like this. Dancing, laughing...it feels wrong.
[Seadall]
But it's because times are hard that I have to do
it─to remind the audience what joy feels like.
[Seadall]
I want this performance to succeed...for
everyone's sake. Will you help me?
[Yunaka]
I understand how you feel. And I respect that,
honestly. OK... I'll help as best I can.
[Seadall]
Thank you. I can't do it without you, Yunaka.
[Seadall]
Together, I think we can make this one of the
truly great performances.

[Yunaka]
...
[Seadall]
Yunaka...what's wrong? Where's that
boundless joy of yours gone?
[Yunaka]
I can't do it.
[Yunaka]
I can't face the audience─it's too much!
I've gotta sit this one out! I'm sorry!
[Seadall]
What?!
[Seadall]
You were excited to get up on stage the last
time I saw you. What happened?
[Yunaka]
All the nice things you said, choosing me as the
lead... It was all really flattering.
[Yunaka]
But I've never had so many people depending
on me before. What if I'm a letdown?
[Yunaka]
They're here to enjoy themselves. Can they
really do that with someone like me on stage?
[Seadall]
Yunaka, did you enjoy acting and dancing
during our rehearsals? Was it fun performing?
[Yunaka]
Of course it was.
[Seadall]
Well, if you enjoyed it, then the audience will
enjoy it too.
[Seadall]
If you don't trust yourself on this, can you at
least trust me?
[Seadall]
I promise you, everyone is going to have a
good time.
[Yunaka]
...
[Seadall]
My eyes are closed.
[Seadall]
My hand is here. If you trust me, then take it...
and never let go.
[Yunaka]
Your lines... Why are you...
[Seadall]
...
[Yunaka]
...
[Yunaka]
If you're certain this is what you want...
I'm willing to believe in you.
[Seadall]
Thank you for taking my hand. You are meant
to be on that stage, Yunaka.
[Yunaka]
Hehe, as long as I've got your guarantee, I can
honestly say I feel a lot better.
[Seadall]
Soon everyone will see you for the talented
performer I know you to be.
[Yunaka]
Thanks, Seadall.
[Yunaka]
OK, let's not keep 'em waiting.
[Yunaka]
There's a lot of folks out there counting on us
to make them smile!
