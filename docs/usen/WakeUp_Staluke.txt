Sorry, but I'm here to wake you...


Is it even OK for me to be here?
Either way, I can't just abandon wake-up duty...
Excuse me, Divine One...


Good morning.
Are you annoyed that I woke you up? I'm sorry.
I'll leave right awayâ”€on the double!


Was I too loud?
Or am I that disturbing?
I'm so sorry! I'll just leave!

Hello? It's me, the Brodian prince who 
isn't Diamant.


So elegant.
The Divine Dragon at rest. How perfect.
Compared to you...
I bet I look pathetic when I sleep.


Morning.
I have to say, you look so peaceful when 
you're sleeping.
Is that weird?
I'm so sorry!


Oh, good.
You woke yourself up.
Thank you for sparing me the failure.


--- B1 ---

Hello?
It's me, the worst of all princes...


Oh no...
What a contented look.
I should wake you...
but I don't want to...


Oh, you're up.
Were you dreaming just now?
Sorry you have to see my face right 
after waking...


Oh! I really woke you.
I'm glad.
Someone better than me will provide your next 
wake-up call.

Ahh... Such divinity, even while resting.


You said that we share the same footing, but...
If we were to stack our skills and stand on top...
I know you would tower over me...


Morning. It's me. Sorry...
What? You're happy to see me?
You're just being kind...


You woke up...
all by yourself!
I'm sorry!
I shouldn't even be in here!


--- A1 ---

It's me. I was so nervous about waking you that 
I didn't sleep.


Ugh. I'm so tired...
Must stay...awake...
Aah... I really am...worthless...


Aah! What?!
I nodded off at the sacred altar!
I am so, so sorry, Divine One!


You woke up so fast...
even though it's only me.
That makes me happy.


--- A2 ---

Relax. It's just an invitation.
Ugh, I'm so nervous...


I probably look suspicious with all this jerky 
in my pockets...
Come on, Alcryst...
Just ask in a normal, natural way.


G-good morning.
I, uh, stuffed my pants with lots of jerky...
Would you like to feed the wolf?
Phew! I did it.


Aah!
I didn't think you were awake!
Divine One? Would you, uh...
like to go feed that wolf together?


--- S1 ---

It's me, Alcryst...


I know I often put myself down, but...
Here, in this place...
I feel OK.
Because I know I'm your ally.
I promise to maintain your trust in me...
now and in all the days ahead.


Morning!
Huh? What was I whispering?
Ah. It was nothing.
Let's get the day started, shall we?


Morning. I'm glad you're awake.
You have such a glow about you.
I don't know how you do it.


--- S2 ---

It's Alcryst. I'm here to wake you.


Oh! It's the gem I gave you.
It suits you as well as I hoped it would.
Father would be pleased...
If Queen Lumera could see that gem...
I would hope she'd be pleased as well.
Listen... I just need you to know...
Our bond is the greatest honor of my life.


Aah! Did you hear all of that?!
I'm embarrassed, but...
I meant what I said, so this time...I'm not going 
to apologize.


So quick!
You almost caught me daydreaming.
Ugh. I wish I was cool like you.
Maybe someday...
