=== Panette & Pandreo ===

[Panette]
Hello, Pandreo. Have you a moment to spare?
[Pandreo]
Of course! I always have time for my sister.
But first you've gotta tone down the formality.
[Panette]
Ah, all right. You see, there's something I've
been meaning to ask you.
[Pandreo]
Nope, nope. You're still speaking in that
highfalutin way.
[Panette]
You don't really expect me to─
[Pandreo]
Yes, I do. I know you make an effort to sound
fancy, but come on. It's only me here.
[Pandreo]
You can drop the silver-spoon act around your
own brother.
[Panette]
...
[Panette]
Fine. Why are you working for the church?
[Pandreo]
That's what you wanted to know, huh?
[Panette]
Dad was a drunk. Mom was a corrupt priest
who couldn't be bothered to look after her kids.
[Panette]
They were lousy parents.
[Panette]
So why would you wanna follow in their
footsteps─serve their church?
[Pandreo]
I told you what happened after you left, right?
They disappeared.
[Panette]
Yeah. So?
[Pandreo]
Well, the church's followers needed someone to
guide them.
[Pandreo]
That's why I stepped in.
[Panette]
Hmph. So that's what it was.
[Pandreo]
I know it's been a while, but if you'd like to
come pray with us, you're always welcome.
[Panette]
No. I think I'll pass.
[Panette]
I'm done with our parents, and I'm done with
their church.
[Panette]
I'd sooner drop dead than step foot in that
place again.
[Pandreo]
Fair enough.

[Panette]
How come you've never told me off for running
away from home?
[Pandreo]
Why would I? I was glad you got out when
you did.
[Panette]
Huh. I always imagined you'd hold a grudge
against me for flying the coop.
[Pandreo]
Nah. I just wasn't brave enough to do likewise.
Wasn't sure I could make it alone.
[Pandreo]
Meanwhile, look at you. A retainer! You struck
out on your own and made a life for yourself.
[Pandreo]
I'll bet those parents of ours would be glad to
see how well you're doing.
[Panette]
I doubt it. They probably don't care about me
one way or another.
[Pandreo]
...
[Pandreo]
Listen. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but I'm
not one to keep secrets.
[Pandreo]
Mom and Dad tried to find you.
[Panette]
What?! Wolfdung... There's no way.
[Pandreo]
I was surprised too.
[Pandreo]
Maybe they were just concerned about...
keeping up appearances. Hard to say.
[Pandreo]
At any rate, that's the truth. I figured you
should know.
[Panette]
...
[Panette]
What am I supposed to do with that?

[Pandreo]

[Panette]
Hey, brother. You praying?
[Pandreo]
Yes. I'm glad to see you showing your face here.
[Panette]
I've got so many bad memories of this place
that I really didn't want to.
[Panette]
But this isn't our parents' church anymore.
It's yours.
[Panette]
So I figured it might be all right to stop by─
just for a few minutes.
[Pandreo]
Well, it's great to have you.
[Panette]
Yeah. So, um... Guess I'll pray real quick.
[Panette]
...
[Panette]
I prayed for peace.
[Panette]
And while I was at it...I prayed that our parents
are OK. Wherever they are.
[Pandreo]
Good for you, Panette.
[Panette]
What do you think they're doing right now?
[Pandreo]
No idea. To be honest, I have a feeling
they're dead.
[Pandreo]
But who knows? Maybe we'll find them
someday, just like you and I found each other.
[Panette]
Now that we're adults and we have a little
distance from...everything that happened...
[Panette]
I'd like to think we could sit them down and
have an honest-to-goodness conversation.
[Pandreo]
That would be nice.
[Pandreo]
I think they'd be proud of us. Of you, especially.
[Panette]
...
[Pandreo]
Panette, listen. I need you to survive this war.
[Pandreo]
I... I can't bear to lose any more of my family.
[Panette]
Duh. I'm not gonna go dying on you.
[Panette]
In fact, I'll do you one better. I'll save your
priestly hide too.
[Pandreo]
Haha, glad to hear it. With the fearsome Panette
protecting me, I know I'll be all right.
[Panette]
You know it! You and me, we're gonna survive
this thing together.
