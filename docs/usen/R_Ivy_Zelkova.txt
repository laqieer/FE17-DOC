=== Ivy & Zelkov ===

[Ivy]
Ugh...
[Zelkov]
What is the meaning of this *sound,*
Princess Ivy?
[Ivy]
Just a headache.
[Zelkov]
I hope you are not *overworking* yourself.
[Ivy]
I'm fine.
[Ivy]
And there is no need to pretend you care.
[Ivy]
I know you are not fond of me.
[Zelkov]
Hm.
[Zelkov]
Let me *make* this absolutely clear.
[Zelkov]
My concern for your *well-being* is genuine.
[Zelkov]
It is, after all, my *responsibility.*
[Ivy]
Hmm...
[Zelkov]
Yet for some reason, it concerns you whether
I have fond *feelings* toward you.
[Zelkov]
So, allow me to state it *plainly.*
[Zelkov]
I do not have fond *feelings* toward you,
Princess Ivy.
[Zelkov]
I see such things as *irrelevant.*
[Zelkov]
Whatever my sentiments may be, what matters
is that you have my *obedience.*
[Ivy]
What a curious thing for my own retainer to say.
[Ivy]
But that's a relief. I don't like you either.
[Zelkov]
I will *obey* you regardless.
[Ivy]
So good to hear.

[Zelkov]
There is nothing quite so *isolating* as pain.
[Zelkov]
It cannot be explained. The only window to
understanding it is *experience.*
[Zelkov]
Does that mean we are destined to be
*strangers* to one another?
[Zelkov]
Not at all. For we possess the gift of *wisdom,*
by which we may intuit what we cannot see.
[Zelkov]
I have distilled this wisdom to its essence.
I have *corked* it within this tincture.
[Zelkov]
This vessel encapsulates the *light* which will
dispel the dark fog of your isolation.
[Ivy]
...
[Ivy]
I'm sorry, what is happening? What is this?
[Zelkov]
Headache medicine.
[Ivy]
You're saying you made this? For me?
[Zelkov]
Yes. As your retainer, I have a *duty* to serve
you by every available means.
[Ivy]
I... Thank you.
[Zelkov]
Your thanks are unnecessary. I am only *doing*
my duty.
[Ivy]
...
[Ivy]
Thank you for reaffirming exactly why
I dislike you.
[Ivy]
That said... I admit I appreciate your honesty.
[Ivy]
Many in your position would flatter or lie.
[Ivy]
You speak your mind. I respect that.
[Zelkov]
I, uh...
[Ivy]
Did you...have something more to say?
[Zelkov]
Apologies, Princess Ivy. The sentiment merely
*surprised* me.
[Zelkov]
I will take my leave and *attend* to my other
duties. Rest well.
[Zelkov]

[Ivy]
I will. Thank you, Zelkov.

[Ivy]
Zelkov, I have something for you.
[Zelkov]
A paintbrush? Is this for *me*?
[Ivy]
Yes. To thank you for the headache medicine.
[Ivy]
I understand you're a painter. But if you have
no need for it, feel free to get rid of it.
[Zelkov]
On the contraryâ”€I will take *exquisite* care
of it. Thank you.
[Ivy]
I'm...glad you like it.
[Zelkov]
I...
[Zelkov]
Princess Ivy, I hope you know I *enjoy* my work.
[Zelkov]
In fact, when I have a task before me, it is my
way to *immerse* myself in it entirely.
[Zelkov]
In those times, and *only* those times, my mind
is truly at peace.
[Zelkov]
So long as I am your retainer, so long as there
is *work* to do...I have a purpose.
[Zelkov]
That is how deeply I appreciate working
for you.
[Ivy]
I see. If that's true, then I'm happy to have you.
[Zelkov]
These are indeed my *true* feelings. You know
I am unwilling to lie or flatter.
[Ivy]
Yes, you've made that clear.
[Zelkov]
I hope you will never hesitate to delegate *any*
task to me.
[Zelkov]
I would *die* for you, my liege, and gladly.
[Ivy]
Gladly? Despite your lack of fond feelings
toward me?
[Zelkov]
My *feelings*...may have changed.
[Zelkov]
I now think of you as an *acceptable* liege.
[Ivy]
I find you acceptable as well, Zelkov.
[Zelkov]
Hm, kind of you to say.
[Ivy]
However, dying for my sake is not a task to
which I will assign you. Gladly or otherwise.
[Ivy]
Consider yourself under strict orders to survive
as you continue to serve me.
[Zelkov]
You may rely on me, Princess Ivy.
