[Citrinne] 
Why hello, Chloé. Fancy meeting you here.
[Chloé] 
Hi there, Citrinne. I'm just here picking up 
some lunch.
[Chloé] 
You can only get it at this street stall, but the 
taste is worth the trip. It's my favorite.
[Citrinne] 
Really? If it's as delicious as you say, I'd like to 
try some for myself.
[Citrinne] 
Here. I'll treat you. Excuse me, sir? I'll take 
everything you have, please.
[Chloé] 
The whole stock?!
[Citrinne] 
Don't fret about the money. This way, if we 
have extra, we can share with the others.
[Citrinne] 
Thank you for wrapping all of that, sir. Here's a 
little more gold for your trouble.
[Citrinne] 
Huh? Are these...
[Chloé] 
It's folk food! Salt-pickled fish guts, in this case.
[Citrinne] 
Oh. How, uh...charming.
[Chloé] 
Oh, sorry. I love this stuff, but it might be too 
much for you to handle.
[Citrinne] 
No, no. One mustn't show prejudice toward 
food without trying it first.
[Citrinne] 
Here, Chloé. Your portion.
[Chloé] 
Wow, you're letting me have almost all of it. 
Thank you so much!
[Citrinne] 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere 
to be.
[Chloé] 
Must be important. You look pretty serious all 
of a sudden.
[Citrinne] 
It is important. Well, to me it is. Take care.
[Chloé] 
Will do. And thanks for treating me to a heaping 
helping of my favorite folk food!

[Citrinne] 
Hello again, Chloé. Is that folk food you're 
eating?
[Chloé] 
Yep. This boiled frog is super good. You should 
try some!
[Citrinne] 
Ah, no, thank you. I just had a rather large 
lunch.
[Citrinne] 
Uh...
[Citrinne] 
Chloé. You came from money, didn't you?
[Chloé] 
Yeah. My parents are nobles, anyway.
[Citrinne] 
We have that in common.
[Citrinne] 
I am a noble as well─related to the royal family, 
in fact. I have never wanted for anything.
[Citrinne] 
And yet...
[Chloé] 
Hmm?
[Citrinne] 
Tell me. How did you become a retainer?
[Chloé] 
Well, I took the knighthood exam, and then 
I passed, and then I got this job.
[Citrinne] 
Wonderful. That means you possess the skills 
required of a retainer.
[Chloé] 
I don't know how it works where you're from, 
but you're a retainer for a royal family too.
[Citrinne] 
I became a retainer not by virtue alone, but due 
to my family connections.
[Chloé] 
And that feels wrong to you?
[Citrinne] 
If it were only a matter of wounded pride, 
I would not feel troubled.
[Citrinne] 
But...my physical weakness could be a liability 
for His Highness.
[Citrinne] 
So...I can't help but dwell on it.
[Chloé] 
I see.
[Citrinne] 
Forgive me, but I must be going. I have 
somewhere to be once again.
[Chloé] 
All right. It was nice chatting with you. See you 
around, Citrinne.

[Citrinne] 
Ha!
[Citrinne] 
No. This will not do.
[Citrinne] 
I must practice and strengthen myself.
[Citrinne] 
Only then can I protect those I care about.
[Citrinne] 
Hyuh!
[Chloé] 1 
[Chloé] 
Good shot! You were right on target.
[Citrinne] 
Chloé? What are you doing here?
[Citrinne] 
Are you lost?
[Chloé] 
Nope. I know I shouldn't have, but I followed 
you to see what you were up to.
[Chloé] 
Every time you have somewhere important 
to be, you come back covered in mud.
[Citrinne] 
Aha. You were worried about me.
[Citrinne] 
I'm sorry.
[Chloé] 
Don't be.
[Chloé] 
Now I know what the big deal was. You were 
getting in some extra magic training!
[Citrinne] 
Yes, that's right.
[Citrinne] 
As I said, I became a retainer through filial 
connections. I lack the skill required.
[Citrinne] 
I do some extra training every day to make up 
for that deficit─to build my strength.
[Citrinne] 
I wasn't trying to keep these sessions a secret. 
I merely...avoid drawing attention to them.
[Chloé] 
I wish you'd just told me. Then I could've 
helped you out!
[Citrinne] 
You would do that?
[Chloé] 
Sure I would. We're friends, aren't we?
[Citrinne] 
Thank you, Chloé.
[Chloé] 
Besides, folk food tastes even better after a 
good bout of training. You'll see!
[Citrinne] 
Hehe, is that right?
[Citrinne] 
Who knew there was a way to make fish guts 
taste even better!
