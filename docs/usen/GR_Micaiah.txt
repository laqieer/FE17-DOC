=== Micaiah & Alfred ===

--- C ---

[Alfred] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Alfred] 
I'm happy to fight alongside one of the 
Emblems our kingdom kept safe.
[Micaiah] 
I feel the same way. I wondered what you might 
be like, and you're as amazing as I hoped.

--- B ---

[Alfred] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Alfred] 
I hear you can sense people's thoughts. Bet it 
won't work on me! I've been training.
[Micaiah] 
Oh? You seem pretty sure about that. 
Why don't we test that claim?

--- A ---

[Alfred] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Alfred] 
I train and train, but I just can't seem to build 
muscle. Any idea why that might be?
[Micaiah] 
Maybe it's your constitution? My oldest friend 
had the same problem.
[Alfred] 
I know! I'll get the whole kingdom together to 
come up with something to push past my limits!
[Micaiah] 
Wow, you're serious about this. It's good to 
be committed, but be careful not to overdo it.

=== Micaiah & Anna ===

--- C ---

[Anna] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Anna] 
Micaiah! You won't believe what I just got in 
stock! Come take a peek─you won't regret it!
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! All right, all right. You're a merchant 
through and through, aren't you?

--- B ---

[Anna] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
It's really impressive that you run a business 
all by yourself, Anna. And at your age too.
[Anna] 
Don't bring age into this! I was born to sell, 
and I've been selling since I was born!

--- A ---

[Anna] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Your grumbling has been noticeable for a while 
now, Anna. Is there something wrong?
[Anna] 
Yeah. Sales have been in a slump. I've gotta 
turn things around, and fast.
[Anna] 
I know! You predict what'll sell in the future and 
I'll make sure to stock it! I'm a genius!
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! We can certainly try that, but these 
things don't always go the way you'd think.

=== Micaiah & Bunet ===

--- C ---

[Bunet] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Are you heading to the garden, Bunet? 
If so, might I accompany you?
[Bunet] 
You love flowers, don't you? Please, join me. 
Let's enjoy all the garden has to offer.

--- B ---

[Bunet] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What do you have there, Bunet? Something 
special for a dish you're preparing?
[Bunet] 
These are edible flowers. They're difficult to 
grow but taste heavenly in tea and salads.

--- A ---

[Bunet] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Bunet] 
To be a great chef, one must have a profound 
understanding of flavors─of ALL flavors.
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! You sound like someone who has a true 
passion for his profession.
[Bunet] 
That I do. Which is why I'd love to know what 
flavor that fabulous silver hair of yours is.
[Micaiah] 
I suppose...none? It has no physical form, you 
see. But I'll take your curiosity as a compliment.

=== Micaiah & Boucheron ===

--- C ---

[Boucheron] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Ah, um...Micaiah, right? Could I trouble you to 
tell me my fortune?
[Micaiah] 
Boucheron, if you're lost, you can just ask me 
for directions.

--- B ---

[Boucheron] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Ohoho, I love fishing. When my line is cast, I 
could sit there without a thought in my head.
[Micaiah] 
I know what you mean. For me, I can relax like 
that in the shade of the forest's trees.

--- A ---

[Boucheron] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You seem a little down. What's the matter?
[Boucheron] 
Well, Prince Alfred was saying, once again, how 
jealous he is of my physique.
[Boucheron] 
He wished he could "trade everything from the 
neck down." Now I'm stuck with that image.
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! I can see why he'd wish that, but I think 
you're both perfect the way you are.

=== Micaiah & Céline ===

--- C ---

[Céline] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Céline] 
So you were in Firene the whole time, Micaiah? 
I was quite surprised when Mother told us.
[Micaiah] 
My Emblem Ring was something of a secret. 
But I'm glad the secret's out, so we can talk!

--- B ---

[Céline] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Céline] 
Prayer alone won't bring peace. We must keep 
fighting, no matter how thorny the path.
[Micaiah] 
You're right. We have to fight together. I'll back 
you up anytime, Céline.

--- A ---

[Céline] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Céline] 
Is it true that you can foresee the future? Do 
you find that to be a blessing or a burden?
[Micaiah] 
I've had some unpleasant visions, if that's what 
you mean. They made it hard to stay positive.
[Micaiah] 
But they don't necessarily come true. We have 
the power to shape our own tomorrow.
[Céline] 
I believe it is your ability to see silver linings─ 
rather than the future─that makes you special.

=== Micaiah & Chloé ===

--- C ---

[Chloé] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Chloé] 
Wow, Micaiah! You're looking radiant as ever. 
All you need now is a sweet little bird.
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! Thank you! You're looking like 
something out of a storybook yourself.

--- B ---

[Chloé] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Chloé] 
I got my hands on some salted, fermented fish. 
I hear it tastes good enough to knock you flat!
[Micaiah] 
Never mind the taste. I'm worried the smell will 
be enough to do the job...

--- A ---

[Chloé] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What made you become a knight, Chloé?
[Chloé] 
I loved the idea of a young noble on pegasus- 
back protecting the princess, like in fairy tales.
[Chloé] 
Oh, but I take it seriously too! I'm going to fight 
for a peaceful Firene, if you'll fight with me!
[Micaiah] 
That sounds like a lovely tale. I'd be happy to 
play a part in it.

=== Micaiah & Citrinne ===

--- C ---

[Citrinne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Citrinne] 
This world must seem so confusing to you and 
your fellow Emblems. If I can ever help, I shall.
[Micaiah] 
How considerate! Thank you, Citrinne. I might 
take you up on that.

--- B ---

[Citrinne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You're carrying an awful lot of candy, Citrinne. 
Are you on your way to some sort of festival?
[Citrinne] 
Oh, this? I just discovered that a friend of mine 
has a sweet tooth. I'm on my way to spoil them!

--- A ---

[Citrinne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Children always cry when they see me smile... 
How can I get them to stop being scared of me?
[Micaiah] 
It's normal for children to fear strangers. 
I'm sure they won't cry after they've met you!
[Citrinne] 
Oh! I see! So...you don't find my smile even the 
least bit frightening, Micaiah?
[Micaiah] 
Not one bit. I see only kindness. If that kindness 
can survive this war, it can survive anything.

=== Micaiah & Clanne ===

--- C ---

[Clanne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I can see why you revere the Divine Dragon. 
Few people possess such a special charm.
[Clanne] 
I agree! Would you like to take care of the 
Divine Dragon with me?!

--- B ---

[Clanne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Clanne] 
I saw you in the Somniel's forest the other day, 
Lady Micaiah. What were you doing there?
[Micaiah] 
I was listening to the birds. They remind me of 
an old friend, and it puts my mind at ease.

--- A ---

[Clanne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You look like you feel down, Clanne. 
Can I help you with anything?
[Clanne] 
I'm thinking about the Divine Dragon and, well, 
my heart kind of aches because of it.
[Clanne] 
Imagine sleeping that long, then you wake up 
and it's just bad thing after bad thing...
[Micaiah] 
That's sweet. Let us both help to end the war, 
so everyone can have peace in their life.

=== Micaiah & Diamant ===

--- C ---

[Diamant] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Diamant] 
I hear you're well-versed in magic, Micaiah. And 
you're a skilled healer as well? How impressive!
[Micaiah] 
Such direct praise! I'm a bit embarrassed...but 
I do appreciate your kind words, Diamant.

--- B ---

[Diamant] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Another day of training? Your diligence is 
remarkable, Diamant.
[Diamant] 
Commanders don't get days off. Daily training is 
the best way to keep the odds in our favor.

--- A ---

[Diamant] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Diamant] 
As a future king, I've studied all major subjects: 
political theory, economics, martial arts...
[Diamant] 
But magic? I could never get a handle on magic. 
It seems beyond me...
[Micaiah] 
So...even the crown prince of Brodia has room 
for growth. That's a bit surprising!
[Micaiah] 
If magic concerns you, just count on me. I'll do 
everything I can to support you in battle.

=== Micaiah & Etie ===

--- C ---

[Etie] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What's that you drink after your workouts? 
I've seen Alfred downing it too.
[Etie] 
It's a special drink made with a raw egg. If I'm 
right, it should help build muscle mass!

--- B ---

[Etie] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What a nice scent...and such pretty flowers! 
Isn't your hometown famous for its gardens?
[Etie] 
Yeah, I get them delivered sometimes. Not so 
much now, though, what with the war.

--- A ---

[Etie] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Wow, your abs are so...toned. That must have 
taken a lot of work.
[Etie] 
Yeah, I guess so. I just like giving my abs 
some tough love.
[Micaiah] 
How so?
[Etie] 
By working them hard! The rougher the routine, 
the better that exhaustion feels afterward.

=== Micaiah & Fogado ===

--- C ---

[Fogado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Fogado] 
Hey, Micaiah! I think it's time we throw a party 
to celebrate all our new friends. You in?
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! That certainly sounds like fun. I would 
be happy to join.

--- B ---

[Fogado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Fogado] 
Hey, Micaiah. Got any plans for tomorrow?
[Micaiah] 
You're having another party, aren't you? But 
you had one yesterday and the day before that.

--- A ---

[Fogado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You are looking rather pleased with yourself, 
Fogado. Why is that?
[Fogado] 
I just got my hands on this super-rare musical 
instrument. I can't wait to give it to my sis.
[Micaiah] 
Oh, I'm sure she'll be delighted. You really do 
care for her, don't you?
[Fogado] 
You know how it is. You've got to show the love 
to the people you love.

=== Micaiah & Framme ===

--- C ---

[Framme] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You always look like you're having 
so much fun, Framme.
[Framme] 
I am! I mean, I can't put a smile on the Divine 
Dragon's face if I'm not wearing one myself.

--- B ---

[Framme] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Framme] 
Lady Micaiah, what sort of attendant do you 
like best? I mean, what qualities wow you?
[Micaiah] 
Oh, Framme, you needn't change a thing. The 
Divine Dragon likes you exactly as you are.

--- A ---

[Framme] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Framme] 
Lady Micaiah! No matter what anyone says, I'm 
the Divine Dragon's number one fan! Right?!
[Micaiah] 
What's this all about, Framme?
[Framme] 
It's just, there are so many more Divine Dragon 
fans these days. What if I lose my spot?
[Micaiah] 
Hmm, I see. Why don't I read your fortune? 
I think it might offer you the guidance you need.

=== Micaiah & Goldmary ===

--- C ---

[Goldmary] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I hope my staggering charisma isn't going to 
be a problem for you, Micaiah.
[Micaiah] 
I'll do my best to keep it from interfering 
with our friendship.

--- B ---

[Goldmary] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You seem pensive, Goldmary. What's on 
your mind?
[Goldmary] 
I'm usually the charming one in any pair, but in 
our case, I-I think it might actually be you.

--- A ---

[Goldmary] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Goldmary] 
It's a shame my home village is so far away. 
I would love to show you the hot springs.
[Micaiah] 
That sounds like fun. A bath might be wasted 
on me, though, since I have no physical form.
[Goldmary] 
True. Maybe it's for the best, then. The envy 
would be too much for you, I'm sure.
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! You seem to hear only what you want 
to hear.

=== Micaiah & Hortensia ===

--- C ---

[Hortensia] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I'll do my best to help you all I can, Hortensia.
[Hortensia] 
Hmph, I don't need you. But since you're cute, 
I'll give you a chance to prove yourself.

--- B ---

[Hortensia] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Ugh, would you stop looking at me like that? 
It's like you're seeing my soul. I kinda hate it.
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! I'm only making sure you're all right. 
I worry about you sometimes, that's all.

--- A ---

[Hortensia] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Hortensia] 
My sister abandoned Elusia, even knowing I was 
still there. She left me behind.
[Micaiah] 
You and Ivy are family. She cares about you 
more than anyone else in the world. Trust me.
[Hortensia] 
How can you be so sure? Did you read her mind 
or something?
[Micaiah] 
No, but I know how she feels. There's someone 
I care for in much the same way.

=== Micaiah & Ivy ===

--- C ---

[Ivy] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I'm worried you might be pushing yourself 
too hard, Ivy.
[Ivy] 
I swore to aid the Divine Dragon, Micaiah. 
That is what I'm going to do.

--- B ---

[Ivy] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Why don't we take a relaxing stroll through 
the forest, Ivy?
[Ivy] 
Can you sense when I'm feeling troubled? 
You always seem to know what I need.

--- A ---

[Ivy] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
It hurts to fight against your own ideals. 
I know that pain all too well.
[Ivy] 
You managed to overcome that struggle, 
did you not?
[Ivy] 
I hope someday to follow your example.
[Micaiah] 
No fortune-telling skills needed to predict that. 
I've seen what you're made of. You'll get there.

=== Micaiah & Jade ===

--- C ---

[Jade] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Jade] 
It's said even a roadside pebble can shine like a 
gem with enough polish. Isn't that inspirational?
[Micaiah] 
That does apply to people as well, but in my 
eyes, Jade, you already shine like a gem.

--- B ---

[Jade] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Diamant was guffawing at a book earlier, and 
he told me you're the author! What is it about?
[Jade] 
It's the saga of a certain alpaca wrangler. I just 
finished the fifth volume. Sounds like a hit!

--- A ---

[Jade] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Jade] 
I hear you once led a band of freedom fighters 
called...the Dawn Brigade? Was that the name?
[Micaiah] 
That's right. But we weren't as pristine as that 
makes us sound. Some mistook us for bandits...
[Jade] 
You? Mistaken for a common, blade-licking 
bandit?! That's... Sorry, I just...can't picture it!
[Micaiah] 
No need to hold back! It is pretty funny. Despite 
that confusion, most still called us "virtuous."

=== Micaiah & Jean ===

--- C ---

[Jean] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Jean] 
You can heal people without medicine or a staff, 
right? That's incredible.
[Micaiah] 
Thank you, but it takes a lot out of me, so it's 
not something I can do all the time.

--- B ---

[Jean] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
It's really something to see a boy your age so 
trained in medicine.
[Jean] 
Well, I've still got a lot to learn. But it feels good 
to hear that you think I'm on the right track.

--- A ---

[Jean] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Jean? Are you crying?
[Jean] 
Sorry you had to see that... I lost a patient who 
got hurt in battle. I wasn't good enough.
[Jean] 
And on top of that, I can't seem to stop crying. 
Why can't I just be grown-up already?
[Micaiah] 
Going through this will make you stronger. 
You're going to be an amazing doctor, Jean.

=== Micaiah & Kagetsu ===

--- C ---

[Kagetsu] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Micaiah! Our bond of friendship is stronger than 
any other. Call on me for anything you need.
[Micaiah] 
Um... Thank you? Though, I worry our bond is a 
little new for statements such as that one.

--- B ---

[Kagetsu] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
I wish to be great friends with Princess Ivy, but 
it would seem she does not feel similarly.
[Micaiah] 
That may have been the case before, 
but perhaps she's come around.

--- A ---

[Kagetsu] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
The culture of my home is quite different from 
here. Studying Elusia has taught me very much.
[Micaiah] 
What have you learned?
[Kagetsu] 
Many new fighting styles. I was undefeated at 
home, but here, Zelkov was able to best me.
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! Sounds like you've got yourself 
a proper rival.

=== Micaiah & Lapis ===

--- C ---

[Lapis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Your world differs from my own, but our forests 
share the same stillness. I pine for that quiet...
[Lapis] 
Yes! I love the forest too! I could spend a whole 
day there crafting fur─ I mean...birdwatching?

--- B ---

[Lapis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Lapis] 
I hope we can end this war soon. The longer the 
fighting drags on, the more commonfolk suffer.
[Micaiah] 
I see why Alcryst enjoys your company, Lapis. 
You have a kind and righteous heart.

--- A ---

[Lapis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Is there a reason you're sneaking around, Lapis?
[Lapis] 
Micaiah?! I, uh, just got a bunch of taters from 
home. Er, the market! Yep, that's where I was...
[Micaiah] 
Wow! You have so many! I just love potatoes. 
There's no bad way to cook them, you know?
[Lapis] 
You're a fellow tater fan? I never would have 
guessed. You're my kind of mysterious, Micaiah!

=== Micaiah & Lindon ===

--- C ---

[Lindon] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Lindon? Why are you staring at me?
[Lindon] 
Forgive me. I was just thinking that powerful 
mages can't be judged by outward appearances.

--- B ---

[Lindon] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You carry that portrait of your wife around 
with you wherever you go, huh?
[Lindon] 
We were always together, from our wedding 
to her death. This way, we're still together now.

--- A ---

[Lindon] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
That's a delicious-looking cake. Did you bake 
it yourself?
[Lindon] 
Haha! Astute of you to recognize talent when 
you see it! I baked this using thunder magic.
[Lindon] 
People only think of magic as a weapon, but it 
can be used in everyday life too.
[Micaiah] 
That's a beautiful idea. I wonder if I could find 
a use like that for my own magic...

=== Micaiah & Louis ===

--- C ---

[Louis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You have a few young brothers, right? If they're 
like the boy I knew, they must be a handful.
[Louis] 
Ah, how I envy this boy you mention! My early 
life was noticeably lacking in female friends.

--- B ---

[Louis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Louis] 
What a joy it is to look upon you, Micaiah. My 
heart swells to behold such a radiant creature.
[Micaiah] 
Wow, I usually don't get that kind of reaction 
when it's just me! You must be in a good mood.

--- A ---

[Louis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What was that unusual blend of tea you made 
the other day? It was so dark.
[Louis] 
That would have been black tea steeped in 
grape juice. It's how we brew it back home.
[Micaiah] 
Grape juice? That's an interesting way of doing 
it. Is there some reason for that?
[Louis] 
They say it's very effective at keeping one 
looking young. We can't all be Emblems, alas.

=== Micaiah & Alear ===

--- C ---

[Alear] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alear] 
You never fail to lift my spirits, Micaiah. I think 
it's that gentle smile you always wear.
[Micaiah] 
I smile most when you're around. There's just 
something warm and comforting about you.

--- B ---

[Alear] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alear] 
Out of curiosity, are there dragons in your 
world too?
[Micaiah] 
Yes. We have wyverns, and humans who turn 
into dragons. But they're not divine, like you.

--- A ---

[Alear] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alear] 
I'm afraid sometimes my own power won't be 
enough. Would you read my future for me?
[Micaiah] 
I see a bright future for you. One that you'll 
forge with all the friends at your side.
[Micaiah] 
But I don't need any special foresight to know 
that. You're strong enough to overturn any fate.
[Alear] 
Thank you. I shouldn't doubt myself so much, 
huh? I think I can do it...with your help, anyway.

=== Micaiah & Mauvier ===

--- C ---

[Mauvier] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Mauvier] 
I shall atone for using your power to commit evil 
deeds. I ask only that you save Lady Veyle.
[Micaiah] 
I suspect she would wish for someone other 
than herself to be saved.

--- B ---

[Mauvier] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Every minute, I worry. Could I have helped 
Lady Veyle sooner than I did?
[Micaiah] 
You stood by her side when she needed you 
most. I know that meant everything to her.

--- A ---

[Mauvier] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Was it you who sparked Veyle's love of 
frighteningly extra-spicy food?
[Mauvier] 
Possible. It is not something I have considered.
[Mauvier] 
I did offer Lady Veyle some of my favorite spicy 
candy just after she awakened, after all.
[Micaiah] 
She always looks so happy with her cheeks full 
of candy. It's hard not to smile, seeing that.

=== Micaiah & Merrin ===

--- C ---

[Merrin] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I am grateful for this chance to join forces with 
you, Merrin. United, we are a formidable force.
[Merrin] 
That we are. And I am grateful to fight beside 
an Emblem as powerful and as lovely as you.

--- B ---

[Merrin] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Merrin] 
Micaiah, I must admit I feel an urge to protect 
you. But I wonder if you really need protecting?
[Micaiah] 
You are kind, but do not let my looks deceive 
you. Once upon a time, I was a commander.

--- A ---

[Merrin] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Merrin] 
Is it true there are birds and dragons that can 
turn human in your world?
[Micaiah] 
Yes, that is true. But I think you misunderstand, 
Merrin.
[Micaiah] 
They are humans that can turn into birds and 
dragons, not the other way around.
[Merrin] 
What?! You mean, like the Divine Dragon?! 
Now I'm absolutely dying to meet one!

=== Micaiah & Timerra ===

[Timerra] 1

[Timerra] 
So, Micaiah, tell me─what do you love doing? 
Me, I love traveling, singing, and just having fun.
[Micaiah] 
I enjoy reading books and listening to the wind... 
Mostly, I love the peace and quiet.

--- B ---

[Timerra] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Timerra] 
So, you can see through lies and see the future, 
am I right? I so wish I could do that!
[Micaiah] 
It does have its benefits, but I promise, I would 
never use my powers to cheat at a game.

--- A ---

[Timerra] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Timerra] 
Ya know, Micaiah, you have an amazing voice. 
It's really pretty, but it's also really strong.
[Micaiah] 
Do you think so? I have never thought much 
of my voice.
[Timerra] 
I bet you're a great singer. We should sing a 
duet sometime. I'll provide the instrumentals!
[Micaiah] 
Oh my, that is a lot of pressure. But...I will do it. 
We can sing of our beautiful friendship.

=== Micaiah & Pandreo ===

--- C ---

[Pandreo] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Let me know if anything is weighing you down, 
OK? I bet you've got your share of worries.
[Micaiah] 
That's very kind, Pandreo, but everyone here 
is so thoughtful I find I'm completely at ease.

--- B ---

[Pandreo] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I wondered whose pretty singing voice that was. 
Hmhm! You've drawn an audience, I see.
[Pandreo] 
Lady Micaiah?! Y-you're too kind. It's weird, but 
these little birds surround me every time I sing.

--- A ---

[Pandreo] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lady Micaiah? You have need of me?
[Micaiah] 
Oh, I'm so sorry I interrupted you while you 
were praying. I just came by to say hello.
[Pandreo] 
It's all right. All those lives we took...I'm praying 
they rest in peace. Would you like to join me?
[Micaiah] 
Yes, I'd like that. They may not forgive us, 
but still, I will pray for the souls lost in battle.

=== Micaiah & Panette ===

--- C ---

[Panette] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
That last battle was quite impressive. 
You were very brave, Panette.
[Panette] 
I am the axe of the princess. I shall strike down 
any obstacle that dare try to impede her!

--- B ---

[Panette] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Panette] 
I hear you are quite fond of the forest, Micaiah. 
We two should take a stroll in the woods.
[Micaiah] 
Hm, I would like that. I've been curious to see 
what you catch with that big net of yours.

--- A ---

[Panette] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You want your fortune read? Hm, is this about 
the ghost seen wandering the Solm desert?
[Panette] 
Indeed! Pray tell, does the ghost of the desert 
bandit who died with his riches truly exist?!
[Micaiah] 
You seem awfully excited about this, Panette. 
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?
[Panette] 
Afraid of ghosts? Not in the slightest! Besides, 
I've nothing to fear with you by my side.

=== Micaiah & Rosado ===

--- C ---

[Rosado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Your wyvern friend is wonderful, Rosado! 
What do you call her?
[Rosado] 
Her name is Camille and we are inseparable. 
Isn't she a beauty?

--- B ---

[Rosado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
That's a heavy-looking parcel. What's inside?
[Rosado] 
Some cute little stones I picked up around the 
Somniel. Planning to arrange them for a picture.

--- A ---

[Rosado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Rosado] 
You have such beautiful silver hair, Micaiah. 
It gives you a soothing, sophisticated look.
[Micaiah] 
Oh, thank you. I haven't always cared for it, 
myself. It made me stand out a bit too much.
[Rosado] 
No such thing! I loved it the moment I laid eyes 
on it, and that should be all you need to know.
[Micaiah] 
That's high praise, coming from someone with 
hair as radiant as yours.

=== Micaiah & Saphir ===

--- C ---

[Saphir] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Saphir] 
The front lines of a battle can get pretty rough. 
Keep behind me if you need to, OK?
[Micaiah] 
I'm used to leading troops from the vanguard. 
I'll be fine.

--- B ---

[Saphir] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Not training today, Saphir?
[Saphir] 
Nope. Today's a rest day. Gotta give the 
muscles time to recover, y'know.

--- A ---

[Saphir] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
It's unlike you to be in such a rush, Saphir. 
Where are you off to?
[Saphir] 
Summons from Prince Diamant. He's caught an 
enormous fish and wants some help cooking it.
[Micaiah] 
I had no idea your culinary skills were in such 
high demand. Consider me impressed!
[Saphir] 
Hehe, I grew up in a fishing town, so I'm good 
with seafood. With anything else, I'm hopeless.

=== Micaiah & Seadall ===

--- C ---

[Seadall] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
There is so much grace in the way you dance, 
Seadall. I could never move like that.
[Seadall] 
Please, allow me to teach you. One day, you 
may want to dance with someone special.

--- B ---

[Seadall] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Your dancing... How should I put this... It feels 
as if each step is filled with kindness.
[Seadall] 
No one has ever told me that. Your Sacrifice 
ability is filled with kindness too, Micaiah.

--- A ---

[Seadall] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
This is the first time anyone's read my fortune! 
Well? What do you think this grail card means?
[Seadall] 
Le Roi du Graal─the King of Sangrails─speaks 
to your nature. It says, "You are deeply kind."
[Seadall] 
It also says, "You tend to the wellbeing of 
others, but push yourself too hard"
[Micaiah] 
I don't mean to. But I will try to take better 
care of myself. Thank you, Seadall.

=== Micaiah & Alcryst ===

--- C ---

[Alcryst] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alcryst] 
I hope I don't let you down too badly, Lady 
Micaiah. I'm nothing compared to my brother...
[Micaiah] 
You remind me of someone. But you're more... 
I suppose "strong-willed" is the polite phrase.

--- B ---

[Alcryst] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Alcryst, you should try and step back and better 
appreciate your skills. Can you do that for me?
[Alcryst] 
But if I do that, I might realize I'm even more 
pathetic than I thought... I can't risk it!

--- A ---

[Alcryst] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alcryst] 
My brother is one in a million. Strong, wise, 
kind... He's truly a wonder to behold.
[Micaiah] 
Oh, but, Alcryst...you're a wonder as well.
[Alcryst] 
Me?! No, no─I'm just leftover scraps compared 
to Diamant.
[Micaiah] 
Your strong, wise, kind older brother disagrees. 
Would you add "lying" to that list of words?

=== Micaiah & Amber ===

--- C ---

[Amber] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Amber] 
Micaiah! Is it true that you have extra powers 
beyond being an Emblem? That's so, SO cool!
[Micaiah] 
I can see glimpses of the future...but not all of 
them are pleasant or "cool."

--- B ---

[Amber] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Amber] 
They say the Solmic desert is home to a rare, 
orange bird that can bring people joy. Is it true?
[Micaiah] 
Oh, I very much hope so! I love birds. We should 
go searching for that legend together someday!

--- A ---

[Amber] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Amber] 
I've been wondering, Micaiah... Don't you ever 
get cold? Your clothes look so light!
[Micaiah] 
That's not a problem for Emblems like me, but 
I appreciate your concern.
[Amber] 
Well, if you ever feel cold, I'll get you a sweater 
from home. They're made from alpaca wool!
[Micaiah] 
Oh! Thank you, Amber. I may not feel the cold, 
but your kindness never fails to warm my heart.

=== Micaiah & Vander ===

--- C ---

[Vander] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Vander] 
What is to be done? The Divine Dragon always 
puts others first, never taking a moment's rest.
[Micaiah] 
I don't know... Such dedication is one of the 
Divine Dragon's loveliest qualities.

--- B ---

[Vander] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Vander] 
Do you enjoy apples, Lady Micaiah? I have such 
an appetite for them.
[Micaiah] 
Why, they all look delicious! I wish I could taste 
one, but the scent alone is lovely.

--- A ---

[Vander] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Oh, Vander, you dropped something! 
Is that a knitting needle?
[Vander] 
Ah, that's... Well, it's maybe a little 
embarrassing.
[Micaiah] 
You knit? What a fantastic hobby to have. 
You must show me your past works!
[Vander] 
Oh, it's just something to keep my hands busy, 
but your excitement is appreciated.

=== Micaiah & Veyle ===

--- C ---

[Veyle] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Veyle] 
I have to make up for all the bad things I've 
done. Will you help? Will you fight beside me?
[Micaiah] 
Oh, Veyle. Of course I will. You are one 
of us now.

--- B ---

[Veyle] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Veyle] 
You have a little brother, right? I've wondered 
what it's like to have a younger sibling.
[Micaiah] 
Ah, well, we aren't actually related. But there 
isn't anything I wouldn't do for him.

--- A ---

[Veyle] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Veyle] 
I sense a familiar loneliness in you. Why is that? 
You don't seem like someone who'd be alone.
[Micaiah] 
Oh, I was alone once, for a very long time. 
I lived in the shadows, hiding a secret.
[Micaiah] 
But I met someone important to me, and my life 
changed. He saved me from the darkness.
[Veyle] 
I see. I met someone who changed everything 
for me too. We have a lot in common, don't we?

=== Micaiah & Yunaka ===

--- C ---

[Yunaka] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Now that I've turned over a new leaf, I intend 
to devote myself entirely to you, Micaiah!
[Micaiah] 
No need for any of that, Yunaka. I'm glad 
you were the one to find me.

--- B ---

[Yunaka] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You keep peering at me from the shadows, 
Yunaka. It's a little unnerving.
[Yunaka] 
Sorry. I could say it's because you're pretty, but 
the truth is...keeping lookout's just an old habit.

--- A ---

[Yunaka] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Yunaka] 
You keep giving me this goofy smile. Am I really 
that funny?
[Micaiah] 
It's not that. You remind me of someone. 
He was very dear to me.
[Yunaka] 
What about me reminds you of him? Is he 
great at impressions or something?
[Micaiah] 
It's your walk. You're so light on your feet that 
it's easy to lose track of your footsteps.

=== Micaiah & Zelkov ===

--- C ---

[Zelkov] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You're very driven, Zelkov, but even the most 
diligent workers need to rest now and again.
[Zelkov] 
I have no need for *rest.* Not when there is 
more to be done.

--- B ---

[Zelkov] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Zelkov] 
A sleeping draught would do much to quiet the 
world's misery. I should *devise* one.
[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! Try a nice herbal tea.

--- A ---

[Zelkov] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Zelkov] 
My yearning for *purpose* continues unabated. 
I need a reason to go on living.
[Micaiah] 
I wish my power could heal your pain.
[Zelkov] 
Your *sacrifice* can mend the body. 
My struggle is in the mind.
[Micaiah] 
I know. I can only pray you'll be at peace 
one day.
