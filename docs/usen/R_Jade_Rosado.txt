=== Jade & Rosado ===

[Jade]
Hello, Rosado. If you have a spare moment,
there's something I'd like to ask you.
[Rosado]
Let me guess. You wanna know the secret.
How'd I get to be so cute?
[Rosado]
Sorry, I don't have an answer for you. I've
always been adorable. I think it's destiny.
[Jade]
No, that's not my question.
[Rosado]
Aw.
[Jade]
Your energy seems to be limitless. I heard you
can work all night and be fine the following day.
[Rosado]
Oh, that's true. Staying up all night is no big
deal to me. I'm always fine the next day.
[Jade]
Ah, I envy that. I'd like to be that way too.
[Jade]
If I were able to work through the night, I could
get so much more writing done.
[Jade]
Can you give me some advice?
[Rosado]
Y'know... I've never really thought about it.
[Rosado]
Pretty sure I just coast through the night on
cuteness. I'm sure you could do it too!
[Jade]
Your energy comes from cuteness?
[Jade]
Strange...but I suppose it's worth a shot.
[Jade]
I've never tried to be cute before. I'd really
appreciate some pointers from a professional.
[Rosado]
Jade...you came to the right place. Let's bring
out your inner sparkle.

[Rosado]
Ready, Jade? Today we set your best self loose.
[Jade]
Set loose? I don't think I'm actively restraining
any part of myself. I'm not sure what to do.
[Rosado]
Do what comes naturally. Strike a pose, say a
phrase─no wrong answers. Be you!
[Jade]
Hm. Very well.
[Jade]
Uh... Shucks-a-doodles.
[Rosado]
Perfect! Yes! You're beautiful!
[Jade]
Really? That did it?
[Rosado]
Really! Now, introduce yourself to me. Tell me
who you are.
[Jade]
Shucks-a-doodles, I'm jimmy-jammy Jade.
[Rosado]
Jade! I promise, I don't say this to everyone.
You're a natural. Over-the-top adorable!
[Jade]
Heh.
[Rosado]
You OK? Something wrong?
[Jade]
I'm fine. That was my laugh.
[Jade]
There's no way this tactic will help me work
through the night. It's totally ridiculous.
[Rosado]
Haha! Well, that's a shame. So does the road
to cuteness end here for you?
[Jade]
I think not. I'm having a good time.
[Jade]
I want to see how much further I can take this.
It's definitely inspiring some new joke ideas.
[Rosado]
Yes! I'm gonna be there every step of the way!

[Jade]
Heyo, rosey Rosado. Having a shucks-a-
doodly day?
[Rosado]
Jade, you're incredible! Every greeting you give
me is cuter than the last!
[Jade]
I must admit, this is a bit addictive. It's fun to
turn this on without warning.
[Rosado]
What a wonderful monster I've unleashed.
Good for you!
[Jade]
Thank you. It's liberating to relax and be silly
like this. I know I don't look the type...
[Rosado]
That's true. Your face is like a marble sculpture.
Classy, majestic─beautifully mysterious.
[Jade]
Sometimes I wonder if I should make an effort
to express myself more.
[Rosado]
That mysterious air is exactly what's unique
about you. Don't you dare hide it.
[Jade]
Well, shucks-a-doodles. I won't.
[Rosado]
There she is! So cute I can barely stand it!
[Jade]
I'm glad this little experiment led to us getting
to know each other, Rosado.
[Jade]
I may not have found any secret wells of energy
to help me write through the night...
[Jade]
But these "cute lessons" will definitely help me
flesh out the quirks of some of my characters.
[Jade]
It's been fun to think about what makes
something cute. Interesting creative exercise.
[Jade]
Thanks for sharing a bit of yourself. These chats
have become very special to me.
[Rosado]
...
[Rosado]
You are...the essence of cute.
[Rosado]
The way your true feelings shine through...
Like a sunbeam─pure and radiant.
[Jade]
Thanks-a-doodles...but I still have a lot to learn
from rosey-posey Rosado, cuteness maestro.
[Rosado]
Hahaha! High praise! Thanks!
