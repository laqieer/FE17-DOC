=== Lucina & Alfred ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
You are the prince of Firene, yes? My ring was
held by your nation 1,000 years ago.
[Alfred]
Really?! You were in Firene back then? Huh.
Well, I'm sure glad to have you back.

--- B ---



[Alfred]
If you were Firene's ring 1,000 years ago, how
come you were moved to a different country?
[Lucina]
Lumera wished it so. Her intent is unknown to
me. Still, she foresaw some reason for a change.

--- A ---



[Alfred]
You knew the Firene royals 1,000 years ago.
Were my ancestors...strong?
[Lucina]
They were strong indeed. But at that time...
their strength could not save them.
[Lucina]
I will not allow that outcome a second time.
You are all under my protection.
[Alfred]
I won't make you go through that a second time
either. We'll stay standing to the bitter end!

=== Lucina & Anna ===

--- C ---



[Anna]
Big sale on again today! Bring your wallets and
purses, everyone!
[Lucina]
Anna? You traveled to this world too?

--- B ---



[Lucina]
It's inspiring how you manage to stay cheerful
despite being separated from your family.
[Anna]
Oh, I'm way too mature to let a little thing like
that get me down.

--- A ---



[Lucina]
My goodness! These shirts! They have your
face on them! That is INCREDIBLE!
[Anna]
You think so? The way they turned out, I was
on the fence about whether to sell them at all.
[Lucina]
You have to sell them! I'd buy 10!
[Anna]
Well, if you like 'em, that settles it! I'll print up
hundreds and make a killing!

=== Lucina & Bunet ===

--- C ---



[Bunet]
Lucina, the legendary sword you wield...
I wonder, what does it taste like?
[Lucina]
Falchion is not an ingredient in a recipe! But...
now that you ask, I can't help but wonder too.

--- B ---



[Bunet]
Do you enjoy watching me prepare
food, Lucina?
[Lucina]
I do. I've learned a lot from watching how you
wield your chef's knife, Bunet.

--- A ---



[Lucina]
After observing your knife skills, my sword
skills have gotten a fair bit sharper, Bunet.
[Bunet]
I'm pleased to hear that, especially since the
dish I've been working on was inspired by you.
[Bunet]
My aim is to make it just as enjoyable to gaze
upon at as it is to taste.
[Lucina]
I'm so happy I was able to inspire you. I look
forward to enjoying this feast for the eyes.

=== Lucina & Boucheron ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
Tell me, what does one do all day to attain
musculature like yours?
[Boucheron]
Well, if you're me, you read and fish. Is that the
answer you were looking for?

--- B ---



[Lucina]
It never occurred to me that reading and fishing
could result in the perfect body.
[Boucheron]
Those are just my hobbies. The muscle comes
naturally for someone with my constitution.

--- A ---




[Boucheron]
So even Emblems work out. But do you really
need to do it all the time?
[Lucina]
I must always strive for more. My body must be
perfectly honed if I'm to save the world.
[Boucheron]
Doing too much will wear you down, not build
you up. Hm, how about we take a book break?
[Lucina]
If that is what you advise, then very well. Would
you read to me from one of your favorites?

=== Lucina & Céline ===

--- C ---




[Céline]
Good day, Lucina. Thank you for your help in
battle earlier. Have you time to chat today?
[Lucina]
Of course. Knowing one's allies can be useful
in combat. So tell me all about yourself.

--- B ---




[Céline]
The more I hear of the ruined world of Ylisse,
the more I realize how sheltered I've been.
[Lucina]
I disagree. You fight as hard as anyone. Firene
will never meet the same fate as my home.

--- A ---




[Céline]
What do you think we ought to do to achieve
true peace, Lucina?
[Lucina]
Explore peaceful ways of solving problems, to
begin with. Violence should be a last resort.
[Lucina]
I'm only one person, but I'll wield my sword
when necessary to protect my loved ones.
[Céline]
On that score, we are of one mind. Let us keep
working toward peace, however we must.

=== Lucina & Chloé ===

--- C ---



[Chloé]
Hey, Lucina. If you have time, do you want to
come to the market with me?
[Lucina]
That sounds delightful. I'm so very interested in
seeing the settlements of this world.

--- B ---



[Lucina]
I don't recognize any of the foods you eat,
Chloé. Are they common in your world?
[Chloé]
The stuff I just bought is folk food, which is a
little off the beaten path. I love it, though!

--- A ---



[Lucina]
The presence of so many different foods proves
that this world hasn't yielded to despair.
[Chloé]
I agree! Still, more and more of those stalls
close down every day.
[Lucina]
We'll put a stop to that. Let us return light to
this world, so that they may reopen once more.
[Chloé]
And so all the best foods are back on the menu,
right? That's something worth fighting for!

=== Lucina & Citrinne ===

--- C ---




[Citrinne]
You're really strong, aren't you, Lucina? I must
admit, I'm actually quite envious of you.
[Lucina]
There's no need for envy, Citrinne. Anyone can
grow stronger with the right kind of training.

--- B ---




[Citrinne]
Lucina, would you mind if I watched you train?
I'd love to learn from you, if that's possible.
[Lucina]
I wouldn't mind at all. If my efforts can help
you grow, then observe as much as you like.

--- A ---




[Citrinne]
I know what I need to do, but I can't get my
body to obey. I may be weak forever...
[Lucina]
You won't become strong overnight...but you
are stronger today than you were yesterday.
[Lucina]
Don't give up, Citrinne. You'll keep growing, bit
by bit, day by day, until you reach your goals.
[Citrinne]
My goals feel so far away...but you're right.
I will soldier on, Lucina─with you as my guide!

=== Lucina & Clanne ===

--- C ---



[Clanne]
Is it true you're Lord Marth's blood relative?
I didn't know Emblems could be related.
[Lucina]
Yes, I am his descendant. So I try to show that
I'm worthy of that lineage.

--- B ---



[Clanne]
I'm like you and Lord Marth! Us "Stewards of
the Dragon" serve generation after generation.
[Lucina]
That means your ancestors must have fought
beside the Divine Dragon a thousand years ago.

--- A ---



[Clanne]
I've been thinking about family trees and how,
even after I'm gone, my line will go on and on.
[Lucina]
The stewards will too. You'll be part of their
history, and they'll strive to be as heroic as you.
[Lucina]
Much as I tried to become someone King Marth
would be proud of.
[Clanne]
You've inspired me, Lady Lucina. I'm going to
show all the future stewards how to be a hero.

=== Lucina & Diamant ===

--- C ---



[Diamant]
You were a destined monarch like me, Lucina.
I'd love to hear your perspective on ruling.
[Lucina]
Of course. I've never actually ruled a kingdom,
but I would be happy to compare philosophies.

--- B ---



[Diamant]
It's incredible that you managed to keep fighting
as your country fell to ruin. I'm not sure I could.
[Lucina]
I've seen how fierce you can become, Diamant.
I know you would fight bravely till the very end.

--- A ---



[Diamant]
If Brodia's remaining forces fall, the kingdom
could be destroyed. I can't bear that thought.
[Lucina]
I know how hard it is to leave soldiers behind.
For their sake, we must claim a swift victory.
[Lucina]
Brodia will not fall into ruin, Diamant. Never will
you suffer the same anguish that I did.
[Diamant]
Thank you, Lucina. That's reassuring. You may
never claim a throne...but you are a great leader.

=== Lucina & Etie ===

--- C ---




[Etie]
You're staring pretty hard at that flower.
What's up?
[Lucina]
They very rarely bloomed in the world I grew
up in. This is a novel sight to me.

--- B ---




[Etie]
It sounds like you lived through some pretty
hard times. Is that how you got so toned?
[Lucina]
I hadn't thought too much about it, but that's
certainly possible.

--- A ---




[Etie]
Hey, Lucina. Is there anything you wish you
could do once this war is over?
[Lucina]
Hmm. Before I sleep in the ring once more,
I'd like to visit someplace I've never seen.
[Lucina]
I'd also like to see as many flowers as possible.
I like them. They represent peace to me.
[Etie]
Then I'll show you around my hometown! If you
like flowers, you're gonna love it there.

=== Lucina & Fogado ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
So, you're not just a prince─you lead a militia
too. My father did as well, you know.
[Fogado]
Your pops led a group like my Sentinels? What a
great guy! I'd love to throw a party for him.

--- B ---




[Fogado]
We still haven't thrown a proper welcome party
for you, have we? We've gotta get on that.
[Lucina]
That's very nice of you, Fogado. I would love to
take part in such a joyous social gathering.

--- A ---




[Fogado]
I see you're finally starting to relax, Lucina.
It's a good look on you.
[Lucina]
I am? I wasn't aware that my behavior
had changed.
[Fogado]
Yeah, you were pretty guarded at first. But now,
that charming side of yours is starting to show.
[Lucina]
I have you to thank for that. Your friendship has
helped me feel like I can truly be myself.

=== Lucina & Framme ===

--- C ---



[Framme]
Lady Lucina! Please, let me help you out.
Chores, errands─leave 'em all to m─ AAH!
[Lucina]
Framme?! Are you all right? You got so excited
you fell right over!

--- B ---



[Framme]
Every time I try to help out, I get so energized
I mess things up. It's super frustrating.
[Lucina]
Don't worry, we all make mistakes. What
matters most is that you don't get hurt.

--- A ---



[Framme]
I really, really wish I could be more like you,
Lady Lucina. You're so mature and in control.
[Lucina]
Not really. I've been in trouble a few times after
accidentally breaking things while training.
[Lucina]
And, Framme, your enthusiasm is part of your
charm. I hope that never changes.
[Framme]
I'm really glad to hear that, Lady Lucina. If you
like that I'm peppy, then peppy I'll always be!

=== Lucina & Goldmary ===

--- C ---



[Goldmary]
However charming I may be, Lucina, I still find
myself getting nervous around you.
[Lucina]
I don't see why, but I'm sure you'll move past it
as we get to know each other.

--- B ---



[Goldmary]
I may be adorable, but you clearly have
something that I don't. A kind of panache.
[Lucina]
Do I? Well, to be frank, sometimes I wish I had
your superb elegance.

--- A ---



[Lucina]
I've been watching you as we fight together.
I think you've been developing some panache.
[Goldmary]
You think so? I'm so glad. Actually, I've noticed
lately that you can be quite elegant, yourself.
[Goldmary]
Perhaps you and I have been rubbing off on
each other. We do make a fine team.
[Lucina]
Haha, we do. Everyone, I'm very sorry if
Goldmary and I are too much for you to handle.

=== Lucina & Hortensia ===

--- C ---



[Hortensia]
I'm sorry for using your ring to fight for the
wrong side, Lucina. Can I make it up to you?
[Lucina]
No need for that. As far as I'm concerned,
you've done more than enough already.

--- B ---



[Hortensia]
There must be something I can do for you.
Whatever it is, just name it.
[Lucina]
I'm fine. I have all I need. But if you are worried,
I sincerely hope you'll tell me.

--- A ---



[Lucina]
You seem out of sorts, Hortensia. What's on
your mind?
[Hortensia]
I want to be friends with you, but I don't know
how. Can you just tell me what I have to do?
[Lucina]
Have we not been friends all this time? That
would be news to me.
[Hortensia]
Really? Oh, that's such a relief. Why didn't you
say so sooner?

=== Lucina & Ivy ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
Thanks to you, I can continue to serve the
Divine Dragon. I want you to know I'm grateful.
[Ivy]
I did not do it for thanks. I did it because
it was right.

--- B ---



[Lucina]
My friend had a wyvern like yours─she had a
very special name. He loved her dearly.
[Ivy]
I never thought to give mine a name. Do you
have any suggestions?

--- A ---




[Ivy]
I felt prepared for it at the time, but the loss
of my father has been a stubborn wound.
[Lucina]
I know the feeling all too well. If you want to
talk about it, please know I'm here.
[Ivy]
Thank you. Would you mind telling me of your
father? It might help to hear your experience.
[Lucina]
I don't think I'm over the loss either─even now.
But if it's useful, I'll gladly tell you everything.

=== Lucina & Jade ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
I've heard you write very funny novels, Jade.
May I read some of them?
[Jade]
Of course, Lucina. I'm not sure they'll be your
kind of humor...but I hope you enjoy them.

--- B ---



[Lucina]
Your novel was so funny, Jade! When the main
character had to leave home...I was in stitches!
[Jade]
That was supposed to be an emotional moment.
You must have a, uh, unique sense of humor.

--- A ---




[Jade]
Have you finished the rest of my novel, Lucina?
I'm curious...which parts made you laugh?
[Lucina]
Oh, I laughed at so many parts! There was that
one scene, and that other one...and the ending!
[Jade]
You laughed at the ending? Really? This is...
valuable feedback. I may run some edits by you.
[Lucina]
Yes, please! You're a fantastic writer, Jade.
I'll be looking forward to more!

=== Lucina & Jean ===

--- C ---



[Jean]
Thanks for pulling me out of hot water earlier!
[Lucina]
It worked out that way this time, that's all.
Next time, I might rely on you to save me.

--- B ---



[Lucina]
You really outdid yourself in the battle today.
Your presence was invaluable.
[Jean]
Aw, Lucina, you'll make me blush. But I did
feel like I was contributing a little more.

--- A ---



[Jean]
I'm so tired. I can't even lift a finger anymore.
[Lucina]
You did outstanding today, Jean. But don't
work yourself to the bone.
[Lucina]
I understand wanting to save as many as you
can, but if we lose you, all that stops.
[Jean]
You're right. I'll be careful not to let myself end
up as the next one in a sickbed.

=== Lucina & Kagetsu ===

--- C ---



[Kagetsu]
Your skill is just what I would expect of an
Emblem. Will you face me in mock combat?
[Lucina]
I've been admiring your swordplay as well.
I'd be delighted to spar with you.

--- B ---



[Lucina]
All your training has paid off, Kagetsu. You were
spectacular in that last battle.
[Kagetsu]
I am glad to hear you say so─and even more
glad we are such good friends!

--- A ---



[Lucina]
What drives you to grow stronger, Kagetsu?
[Kagetsu]
It is very simple. If I am to climb this mountain
we call life, I wish to see it from its peak.
[Lucina]
A noble goal. That simple determination might
be the key to your success.
[Kagetsu]
And you, my friend and rival, are one step along
my path to greatness! Prepare to be surpassed!

=== Lucina & Lapis ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
Why are you carrying so many tools, Lapis?
Are you on your way to fix something?
[Lapis]
I'm patching a wall. Someone knocked a huge
hole into it. Who could have been so careless?!

--- B ---



[Lapis]
I grow so attached to things I make by hand...
but that just means I'm more careful with 'em.
[Lucina]
Hmm... A friend I once knew told me that giving
tools their own names can have a similar effect.

--- A ---



[Lapis]
Lucina, you came from a harsh world, right?
I was wondering...what did you eat to survive?
[Lucina]
We had rationed food, so we ate that for a time.
Hunting was also an option. We even ate bears.
[Lapis]
Really?! I do that too! Sometimes I─ Oh, wait.
Sorry. That must have been hard. I... I didn't...
[Lucina]
It's OK, Lapis. I'm happy something like that can
bring us closer together. Tell me more.

=== Lucina & Lindon ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
That's a delicious-looking dessert. Did you
make it, Lindon?
[Lindon]
It was one of my experiments, yes. But don't
worry─the taste is world-class.

--- B ---




[Lindon]
Would you tell me more about your world
today, Lucina?
[Lucina]
Your curiosity seems endless, Lindon. I hope
some of it rubs off on me.

--- A ---




[Lindon]
How were you able to withstand living in such
a desperate, hopeless world, Lucina?
[Lucina]
In all honesty, even with my stubbornness and
pride, I'd have succumbed without my allies.
[Lindon]
So that's where you drew your strength from.
Tighter bonds may be what this world needs.
[Lucina]
Then it's time we forged them for ourselves.
Once we have that, nothing is impossible.

=== Lucina & Louis ===

--- C ---



[Louis]
You seem to be well-liked by all, Lucina. I think
that's simply splendid.
[Lucina]
Uh...is that unusual? I'm sure I have the normal
amount of friends. No more than anyone else.

--- B ---



[Louis]
Indulge me...would you rather treat someone as
a big sister or be treated as such?
[Lucina]
I'd feel a bit uncomfortable being treated that
way. But it would be nice to have a sister figure.

--- A ---



[Lucina]
Louis, what are you getting at with all these
questions you've been asking?
[Louis]
Must I be "getting at" anything? I have a natural
curiosity about the way people socialize.
[Lucina]
So you like people-watching. I see. But why the
intense interest in me particularly?
[Louis]
Why would I not be? Your circumstances are so
unique that I find myself utterly captivated.

=== Lucina & Alear ===

--- C ---




[Alear]
Thank you for the hope you showed me back
then. If not for you, I might have given up.
[Lucina]
I only gave you a small push. You'll be carving
your own future for yourself.

--- B ---




[Alear]
I worry sometimes if we're really capable of
winning this war.
[Lucina]
I know things can seem bleak. But as long as
you hold out hope, you can drive the dark away.

--- A ---



[Lucina]
Long ago, I was driven from my home. But I'd
have died if I stayed. All would have been lost.
[Alear]
I see what you mean. Sometimes you have to
withdraw... But did you win in the end?
[Lucina]
Yes. I made a new future, and you can too.
So never give up until your last breath.
[Alear]
Understood. Then no matter how hard things
get, I'll believe that they'll turn out for the best.

=== Lucina & Mauvier ===

--- C ---



[Mauvier]
I do not require your concern. Lady Veyle needs
you more.
[Lucina]
I'm keeping an eye on Veyle, but my worries are
equal for you, Mauvier.

--- B ---



[Mauvier]
Your presence has caused Lady Veyle to smile
more. Thank you.
[Lucina]
There's no reason to thank me. Veyle's smile is
your doing, Mauvier.

--- A ---



[Mauvier]
Who I was, what I did... I do not regret those
actions so much as the actions I did not take.
[Mauvier]
Were I more diligent in my efforts as friend and
protector, might Lady Veyle have been happier?
[Lucina]
The past is out of reach for most. Yet the future
can be changed for any of us. You included.
[Lucina]
I'm happy to help. From now on, let's ask
ourselves what would bring Veyle happiness.

=== Lucina & Merrin ===

--- C ---



[Merrin]
Lady Lucina, I understand you used to fight
wearing a mask. I might try wearing one myself.
[Lucina]
I only wore one to hide my identity. But I do
think a mask would look dashing on you, Merrin.

--- B ---



[Merrin]
Your fight style is so cool. It makes me want to
come up with an epic new move of my own.
[Lucina]
I'm not sure you need a new move, but if you
do, you should call it the "Swordy Poke-Poke"!

--- A ---



[Merrin]
The more we fight beside each other, the more
I see how cool you are. I─ I want to be like you!
[Lucina]
Oh, if you only knew how I see you. You carry
yourself with such confidence. I truly envy that.
[Merrin]
You do?! What a nice thing to say. I guess we've
got a mutual-admiration thing going on here.
[Lucina]
I guess we do. I hope we consider each other
not just allies but friends, now and forever.

=== Lucina & Timerra ===

--- C ---




[Timerra]
I couldn't help but notice your left eye, Lucina.
That design is so mysterious and super pretty.
[Lucina]
And your eyes have such a majestic shimmer.
Is that a trait that runs in the royal family?

--- B ---




[Timerra]
I got my eyes from my mother. It's a sign that I
have what it takes to be queen of Solm one day.
[Lucina]
The Brand in my eye runs in my family as well.
I'm so pleased our royal families share this.

--- A ---



[Lucina]
Does the royal family of Solm have other unique
characteristics beyond the sparkling eyes?
[Timerra]
No, we're pretty normal, really. In fact, not
everyone in our family even gets the cool eyes.
[Lucina]
Well, with or without a royal mark, being part
of a ruling family can be a burden to bear.
[Timerra]
True, but I like our eyes and what they stand
for. And, hey, we can bear any burden together.

=== Lucina & Pandreo ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
You know, Pandreo, I happen to be friends with
another rather un-priest-like priest.
[Pandreo]
You're friends with an unusual priest like me?
No way! You've got to tell me all about him.

--- B ---



[Lucina]
What a unique training regimen you have.
The violent jumping and odd lurching moves...
[Pandreo]
Oh, I was actually...dancing. But since you were
so impressed, let's just call it training, OK?

--- A ---



[Lucina]
You've had to leave your church unattended for
a long time now. Does that worry you?
[Pandreo]
I don't have a choice, Lucina. I have to focus on
this fight. If the world dies, faith dies with it.
[Lucina]
I see. In my world, near the end, shows of faith
were rare. And for some, were abandoned.
[Pandreo]
Please, let me say a prayer for your world.
May the souls that were lost find peace at last.

=== Lucina & Panette ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
Panette, I must apologize for earlier. It was silly
of me to scream so loudly at the sight of a bug.
[Panette]
Not to worry. No doubt you were weary from
battle. Besides, it was cute to see you flustered.

--- B ---



[Lucina]
Eeeek! It's a giant bug! I─ I don't know what
to do!
[Panette]
Oh now, calm yourself, Lucina. I shall drive it
away for you.

--- A ---



[Lucina]
Panette, please, you must teach me how to
conquer my fear of bugs. It's so embarrassing.
[Panette]
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
Revealing a bit of weakness can be charming.
[Panette]
Should a bug appear again, I will simply take
care of it for you. That way you can rest easy.
[Lucina]
Thank you, Panette. That is reassuring. Next
time I see a bug, I'm hiding behind you.

=== Lucina & Rosado ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
Your wyvern's adorable, Rosado. You know
what would really top off her look?
[Rosado]
Please, stop suggesting the bear hat.

--- B ---




[Rosado]
I hate war. Everyone's so caught up in fighting
that they don't even care about what's cute.
[Lucina]
All the more reason to win peace as quickly
as we can.

--- A ---




[Rosado]
You're interested in being cute, right, Lucina?
[Lucina]
I have never given it too much thought, but I
don't see why I would reject the notion.
[Rosado]
Great! I'm always striving to be the cutest, so
let's put our heads together. We can trade tips!
[Lucina]
Sounds like a fine idea to me.

=== Lucina & Saphir ===

--- C ---




[Saphir]
Wouldn't know it to look at you, Lucina, but you
fight with the intensity of a hardened veteran.
[Lucina]
Indeed. I've seen more harrowing battles than
I care to think about.

--- B ---




[Saphir]
You're one of the best fighters I've ever seen.
I'd love to go toe-to-toe with you someday.
[Lucina]
Once we're done with all the real fighting,
I'll indulge you in a proper bout.

--- A ---




[Saphir]
Let's cancel that bout we spoke of, Lucina.
I've changed my mind.
[Lucina]
Fine by me. May I ask why?
[Saphir]
You obviously take no pleasure in battle.
It was selfish of me to ask.
[Lucina]
I appreciate that, Saphir. Here's an idea─how
about you take me fishing instead?

=== Lucina & Seadall ===

--- C ---




[Seadall]
I couldn't help but notice the look on your face
while you watched me dance.
[Lucina]
Your dance looks so incredibly different from
dances in my world. It was entrancing to watch.

--- B ---




[Seadall]
As someone new to our world's art and culture,
I wonder, what do you think of my dancing?
[Lucina]
I don't know much about dance, but I do know
that when you perform, I am filled with courage.

--- A ---




[Seadall]
There's something I have to say to you, Lucina.
And that is, thank you.
[Lucina]
I'm not sure what I've done to earn such
heartfelt gratitude, Seadall.
[Seadall]
Telling me that my dancing gives you courage...
It meant so much to me. It's all I ever hope for.
[Lucina]
I told you the truth, Seadall. Your dance has the
power to fill anyone from any world with hope.

=== Lucina & Alcryst ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
Your fighting style is a wonder to behold,
Alcryst. Where did you learn your technique?
[Alcryst]
Well, my father forced a strict training regimen
onto me as a child. It's...not a fun story.

--- B ---



[Lucina]
I was trained by my own father, just like you,
Alcryst. Seems we have that in common!
[Alcryst]
I'm not worthy of such a favorable comparison,
but I would like to hear more about your father.

--- A ---




[Alcryst]
There are so many wonderful people among our
ranks. I have no right to stand beside all of you.
[Lucina]
That's not true, Alcryst. I'd be struggling if it
weren't for you.
[Lucina]
I still have so much to learn, so much growing
to do. I hope you'll keep fighting by my side.
[Alcryst]
That seems impossible... But if you truly need
my help, I'll lend you every bit of my strength.

=== Lucina & Amber ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
I was told that you're a celebrated hero, Amber.
May I hear about some of your adventures?
[Amber]
Sure! I'll tell you my favorite legends...right after
I get through my coolest alpaca stories.

--- B ---




[Amber]
Hey, Lucina! Get a load of these new clothes!
Isn't this the best getup ever?
[Lucina]
The alpaca cross-stitched into the center is so
large... I love it! Your fashion is truly inspiring!

--- A ---




[Amber]
Hey, Lucina! I'm heading out to find a legendary
weapon. Wanna come?
[Lucina]
A legendary weapon?! If we had something like
that, we could turn the tide of this terrible war.
[Lucina]
I imagine the quest ahead will be most
challenging. What's your plan?
[Amber]
Well, I know hundreds of legends. If we look for
all of them, we're sure to find one that's real!

=== Lucina & Vander ===

--- C ---



[Lucina]
I've heard you're a knitting expert. I'm terrible
with any delicate work, so consider me envious.
[Vander]
Heh. Most are surprised that a man as large as I
is capable of something so...delicate.

--- B ---



[Lucina]
With knitting, you can make sweaters. Like, say,
one with a big picture of your face.
[Vander]
I... I mean... Yes. But I am not so sure who
would willingly wear such a garment.

--- A ---



[Lucina]
Watching you knit, I am reminded of my mother
knitting when I was little.
[Vander]
Oh? She must have been a spectacular woman.
By the by, the sweater you asked for...
[Vander]
The one adorned with my visage? It is finished.
Who shall I give it to?
[Lucina]
Oh, splendid! I imagine the Divine Dragon will
love it. I can't think of a better gift!

=== Lucina & Veyle ===

--- C ---




[Veyle]
Didn't a Fell Dragon ravage your world? You
must hate it when I'm around.
[Lucina]
Not at all. You look different. You act different.
You are your own dragon, Veyle.

--- B ---




[Veyle]
I know Papa is doing awful things. Still, I just
can't bring myself to hate him completely.
[Lucina]
I understand, Veyle. The father-child bond is so
powerful. Do not worry, we'll stop him together.

--- A ---




[Veyle]
Lucina, what was your father like?
[Lucina]
He was strong, wise, and fair. More than
anything, he treasured his bond with his allies.
[Veyle]
He sounds so...good. My Papa was always
alone, always staring at some far-off place...
[Lucina]
He may not have been there for you, Veyle, but
I am here and I will always support you. I swear.

=== Lucina & Yunaka ===

--- C ---



[Yunaka]
Your sword looks an awful lot like Marth's,
Lucina. Is it actually the same blade?
[Lucina]
Good eye. The guard and pommel have been
replaced, but it's otherwise the same sword.

--- B ---



[Yunaka]
I can't get over what a privilege it is just to lay
eyes on a legendary weapon like Falchion.
[Lucina]
Would you believe me if I told you its name
actually used to be Pointy Demonspanker?

--- A ---



[Yunaka]
Pointy Demonspanker? Was Falchion really
called that?!
[Lucina]
Yes─by me. A friend of mine repaired the
weapon, and in his honor I gave it a new name.
[Lucina]
He was less impressed than I'd imagined he
would be. I ended up changing it back.
[Yunaka]
Makes for a great story, though. Now I wanna
give my own weapons fancy names!

=== Lucina & Zelkov ===

--- C ---




[Zelkov]
It seems we share a certain *preoccupation,*
Emblem Lucina. Idleness makes you restless.
[Lucina]
I've never thought of it quite like that before,
but yes, I do think you're right.

--- B ---




[Zelkov]
It must be *difficult* for you to fight boredom
without the ability to handle corporeal objects.
[Lucina]
I wouldn't say that. Listening to people talk
offers me a good deal of entertainment.

--- A ---




[Zelkov]
I see it now. You are the type to ignore your
*own* pain for the benefit of friends and allies.
[Lucina]
I don't think of it in those terms. I just want
to be useful to the people I care about.
[Zelkov]
It was intended as a *compliment.* The way you
live is impossible for me, so I find it impressive.
[Lucina]
It's not impossible at all, Zelkov. You're fighting
for a better world the same way I am.
