Pardon the intrusion, Divine One.


I'm only here to make certain you wake. I hope 
that's all right.
No need to hurry. I'll admire the view while 
I wait.
Ah, look at the gardens. And all those 
fascinating people...


Awake now, are you? Splendid.
Now that I've fulfilled my duty here...
I'll take a stroll through the gardens. Farewell.


Greetings.
I am glad you're awake. I could not bear to 
disturb you.
I'll take my leave.

Morning has come.
I suppose it will take more than saying so to 
wake you.


Although...
I feel I am not the ideal person to be doing this.
Surely the Divine Dragon should be tended to 
by someone more important...


Yes...
A monarch would be appropriate, or at least 
a royal...
Ah! Divine One! How long have you 
been awake?


You're awake already?! But I haven't yet made 
the tea!
I was concerned it would get cold. What a fool 
I've been...


--- B1 ---

Who would be the ideal person to wake the 
Divine Dragon?


If I can't think of the person...
I'll have to envision one.
A gallant knight...
strong, courteous, and kind...


Oh, Divine One. Good morning.
I was just, ah...
Apologies.
But you caught me in the midst of a daydream.


Oh. I was wondering who would be best to 
wake you up...
but it appears such a service is not required at 
all. Good morning.

This is far less trying than waking my 
younger brothers.


With three brothers, one must be quite stern.
I would oft be moved to words like...
"Get up now or there shall be no breakfast 
left for you!"


I see that motivated you quite effectively.
Very interesting.
In that case, please enjoy the breakfast I've 
prepared without delay.


You wake much more readily...
than my family at home.
Thank you for making my job so easy. That is 
very considerate.

If I am correct about this...


Since we each take our turns waking the 
Divine Dragon...
that means...
Heh, I can observe a plethora of people merely 
by waiting around here!


Good morning. I had a wonderful idea just now.
Alas, it would require me to stand watch at 
all hours. I must refrain.


As I thought...
you're already up.
I brought tea.
It's quite a rare blend, flavored with the grapes 
of my hometown.

My brothers will be very interested to read 
about this waking-up ritual.


You advised me to write what I feel in my letter.
And since you are such a large part of my life...
that turned out to mean writing a great deal 
about you.


Would you like to meet my brothers someday?
I'm certain they would love to meet you.
To see all of you gathered together would be...
deeply moving.


Oh, did you hear that?
Of course I mentioned you in my letter.
I told them you are an impressively early riser.


--- S1 ---

No matter how often I come by to wake you up, 
it always makes me a touch nervous.


I must say, it still doesn't feel quite real...
that you gave me the Pact Ring.
When I think of it, I feel as if I'm slipping away...
into another one of my daydreams.
That's how much you mean to me.
My heart swells with happiness whenever 
I think of you.


You're up. How may I serve you this morning?
What? Of course it isn't odd for me to be asking 
you that.
Nothing fulfills me more...
than taking care of you.


You rose so suddenly!
I've gotten used to watching you from afar...
but I'm still unaccustomed to just how close 
we've become.


--- S2 ---

It's morning.
Will you be rising early today or sleeping in?


So you'd like to rest a while longer? I expected 
as much.
You're still wearing my ring.
You must never take it off.
For my part, I'm still getting used to seeing it.
It feels rather like a dream to me.
But of all the dreams I've had in my life...
this is the one I'd want most to come true.


Good, you're awake.
I've so much more to say.
Shall we continue this conversation over a 
lovely cup of tea?
What do you think?


Haha, in a hurry to get up, are you?
No need to rush. I'm not going anywhere.
I intend to remain by your side until the end 
of my days.
