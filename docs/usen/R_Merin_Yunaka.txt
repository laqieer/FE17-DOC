[Merrin] 
Yunaka, do you have a moment?
[Yunaka] 
Sure.
[Merrin] 
About that sparring match just now. I feel like 
your attitude needs...adjusting.
[Yunaka] 
What do you mean?
[Merrin] 
A sparring match isn't a fight to the death. 
But you went right for my throat back there.
[Merrin] 
I'd like it if you slowed things down a bit. 
Try being a bit more...sporting.
[Yunaka] 
What? No, sorry, but that's ridiculous. I'm not 
gonna do that.
[Merrin] 
Excuse me?
[Yunaka] 
Merrin, I know you think it's super stylish to 
pause for a monologue in the middle of a fight.
[Yunaka] 
But if you're gonna do that, you might as well 
point to your kidneys and ask for a shanking.
[Yunaka] 
With me, the worst you get is a bump on the 
noggin. A real enemy would eviscerate you.
[Merrin] 
I know that! I just wanted to test out a bit of 
verbal repartee.
[Yunaka] 
Test it for what? If it's no good in an actual 
engagement then what good is it?
[Merrin] 
I get it, I do. But what's wrong with a bit of 
verbal jousting during sparring matches?
[Merrin] 
Dropping a catchphrase during combat spices 
things up. A mid-battle monologue sounds cool.
[Merrin] 
Just do what you need to do after I'm done 
talking. We're allies, after all.
[Yunaka] 
No. It's a bad habit to make light of combat.
[Yunaka] 
I thought for sure you'd understand that, seeing 
as you're a knight. Guess I was mistaken.
[Yunaka] 
If that's all, I'll be going.
[Merrin] 
Come on, Yunaka. You're right, of course, I just 
wanted to have a bit of...fun.

[Merrin] 
Ah... Well, that should do nicely.
[Yunaka] 
Hey. What are you up to?
[Merrin] 
Oh, hello. Just taking care of some weapon 
maintenance.
[Yunaka] 
Ah! That's, uh... That's quite an interesting 
scimitar you've got there!
[Merrin] 
I bought it at a curio shop. It is pretty cool, 
isn't it?
[Yunaka] 
Understatement of the century! That weapon's 
a masterpiece! A work of art!
[Yunaka] 
Look at the curve─so smooth, so steady! 
That's traditional Solmic craftsmanship!
[Yunaka] 
Look at the edge! Only Solmic blades combine 
rich majestic history with deadly killing power!
[Merrin] 
Huh, I guess I didn't realize. You know, you 
got pretty excited there all of a sudden.
[Merrin] 
If you like it that much, maybe I'll give it to you. 
I'm not even using it really.
[Yunaka] 
Are you serious?! What an incredible gift! 
I'll happily take it off your hands! Give it here!
[Merrin] 
Ah now, there's just one thing...
[Merrin] 
I'll give it to you if you agree to let me do a bit 
of monologuing when we spar from now on.
[Yunaka] 
What?! Come on, what's that got to do 
with anything?
[Yunaka] 
No matter how badly I want the scimitar, it's 
not worth letting you monologue in combat!
[Merrin] 
Too bad. I guess I will be using this majestic 
killing blade after all.
[Yunaka] 
Ngh... Fine! Forget it, then.

[Yunaka] 
Look at that! Nice and clean.
[Merrin] 
What are you up to?
[Yunaka] 
Oh, nothing much. Just polishing up this here 
dragon figurine. Nice, right?
[Merrin] 
Oh, wow! You are not kidding! Look at that! 
Dragon, dragon, dragon! I love dragons.
[Merrin] 
What kind is it? What does it like to eat? 
It's so cute and so cool.
[Yunaka] 
Someone's excited all of a sudden. If you like it 
that much, I could be persuaded to part with it.
[Merrin] 
Really? I want it. I really, really want it! 
Please, I'm begging you!
[Yunaka] 
Just one condition. No more silly chatter during 
combat. Not even in practice.
[Merrin] 
Oh. I see. So that's your play, is it?
[Yunaka] 
A familiar tactic, isn't it?
[Merrin] 
...
[Merrin] 
...
[Merrin] 
What do you say we put an end to this pointless 
and very annoying quarrel?
[Merrin] 
I won't practice my monologues ever again. 
Now please, just give me the dragon!
[Yunaka] 
Great. As long as you're done with that 
ridiculous behavior, consider me satisfied.
[Yunaka] 
Now that that's settled... Can we revisit 
negotiations for that incredible scimitar?!
[Merrin] 
Of course. It's a trade. My weapon for your 
figurine.
[Yunaka] 
Deal!
[Merrin] 
Deal. This is all yours.
[Yunaka] 
Eeee! Yes! OK, here's your dragon─take good 
care of her!
[Merrin] 
Ooo! Hello, my cute little dragon!
[Yunaka] 
Aaah, the color's gorgeous! And the smell... 
Freshly oiled! It's so perfect I could cry!
[Merrin] 
Where did you get this? Your taste is exquisite! 
How much was it? Details, I want details.
[Yunaka] 
Where'd you get this?! Who'd you buy it from?! 
How much did it cost?! Tell me everything!
[Merrin] 
I asked first! Just spill it, please.
[Yunaka] 
Didn't hear a word you said! You talk too fast! 
You answer me first!
[Merrin] 
That doesn't seem fair!
[Yunaka] 
What? Why not?!
[Merrin] 
Haha.
[Merrin] 
So, are we...friends now?
[Yunaka] 
Hehe, now that you mention it...
[Yunaka] 
We do seem to have a lot in common, don't we? 
Not everyone gets so excited over stuff like this.
[Merrin] 
Ha! So true! Yeah, you and I are going to get 
along great.
[Merrin] 
Now, I'm happy to answer questions, but, uh, 
can you repeat them? You were talking so fast.
[Yunaka] 
All right, from the top. The first thing I want 
to know is where exactly you bought it...
