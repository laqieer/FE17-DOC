=== Ivy & Veyle ===
--- C ---



[Veyle]
Can I talk to you, Ivy?
[Ivy]
Certainly, Lady Veyle.
[Veyle]
I just want to say, I'm really sorry.
[Veyle]
I'm sorry my papa made your father...go mad.
[Ivy]
Don't do this.
[Veyle]
I understand he was a gentle king who took
good care of his people and his family, before...
[Veyle]
If it weren't for my father, he'd still be with
his family─with you.
[Ivy]
Please, no more.
[Ivy]
The past is past. There is no use dwelling on it.
[Veyle]
I know you feel that way, but I...
[Ivy]
You owe me no apologies. Your father's sins
are not yours to bear.
[Veyle]
I don't feel like that's true. Please, I have to
do something.
[Ivy]
Stubborn, aren't you?
[Ivy]
In that case, I shall think of some penance you
can perform when next we meet.
[Veyle]
Thank you. I'll do whatever you ask.
[Ivy]
You may come to regret those words.

[Veyle]
Ivy, this is not...
[Ivy]
Too late to take it back─you said you would
do whatever I asked as penance.
[Veyle]
Yes, but...
[Ivy]
No excuses.
[Ivy]
To make amends, you must eat this spicy dish.
And I expect you to clean your plate.
[Veyle]
...
[Ivy]
Has fear rendered you speechless?
[Ivy]
Perhaps I was too harsh. All right─I'll forgive
you if you can endure a single bite.
[Ivy]
This was your own doing, if you'll recall. I still
don't believe you have anything to atone for.
[Veyle]
...
[Ivy]
Wait...
[Ivy]
How are you enjoying this so much? I made
certain it was incredibly spicy.
[Veyle]
I love spicy food!
[Ivy]
You do?
[Ivy]
Father told me you couldn't stand it.
[Ivy]
Perhaps I misheard him?
[Veyle]
Oh, it's so yummy. I can't stop eating!
[Veyle]
But this is definitely not a punishment. It's more
like a reward!
[Veyle]
I love eating this food so much, but I hate not
making amends for the past.
[Ivy]
No matter.
[Ivy]
If she enjoys it, so much the better.
[Ivy]
She is genuinely moved to tears...
[Ivy]
Your atonement ends here, Lady Veyle.
[Veyle]
What?! No!
[Veyle]
This can't be it. I'll stop eating this incredible
food. I will!
[Ivy]
No, please finish it. Don't let it go to waste.
[Ivy]
Seeing you in pain is not going to bring me any
closure, you know.
[Ivy]
If anything...I think seeing you happy is more
likely to do it.

[Veyle]
Oh, Ivy. I need to talk to you about my
atonement the other day.
[Veyle]
I'm so sorry I ate all that yummy food. I just
couldn't help myself.
[Ivy]
Why are you still bringing that up? I thought
for certain we'd resolved this.
[Veyle]
But...
[Ivy]
Listen to me, Lady Veyle.
[Ivy]
My father was corrupted by the Fell Dragon.
He was coerced down a dark path.
[Ivy]
But that is not in any way your fault.
[Veyle]
...
[Ivy]
You are still unconvinced.
[Ivy]
To be frank...I understand. I'm often told that
I am not responsible for my father's misdeeds.
[Ivy]
That does not make it any easier to accept.
[Veyle]
I know exactly how you feel.
[Ivy]
It's a bit ridiculous, isn't it?
[Ivy]
Here I am telling you not to carry the burden
of your father's actions...
[Ivy]
But I could not accept those same words when
they were said to me.
[Ivy]
Nevertheless... We both need to hear it. And we
both need to try, as best we can, to believe it.
[Veyle]
Oh, Ivy...
[Veyle]
I won't mention making amends to you
anymore.
[Veyle]
But there is something I wish for.
[Veyle]
I wish you and I could make this world a place
where people don't carry these awful burdens.
[Ivy]
We share this goal.
[Veyle]
I won't bring up atonement again. I promise.
[Veyle]
I just thought maybe we could help each other...
since we both know what it's like to suffer.
[Veyle]
We could, couldn't we?
[Ivy]
Of course. Absolutely.
[Ivy]
Thank you, Lady Veyle.
[Veyle]
Thank you, Ivy.
