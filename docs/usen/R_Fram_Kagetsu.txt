"I am doing fine. How is everything at home?"

[Kagetsu] 
Hello, Framme. Writing to someone, are you?
[Framme] 
My parents. If I don't send them updates now 
and then, they get all worried.
[Framme] 
Can you believe it? At my age? Are all parents 
like this?
[Kagetsu] 
They are not. Your parents must cherish you.
[Kagetsu] 
We feel concern for ones we love. So it is good 
your family feels concern for you.
[Framme] 
Well...maybe a little.
[Framme] 
You're from really far away, right? Letters from 
your family must be important to you.
[Kagetsu] 
I would not say so. I have not received any.
[Framme] 
Huh? Why not?
[Kagetsu] 
They cannot write to me because I fled my 
home and did not say where I was going.
[Kagetsu] 
But I think they would be too angry to write me 
letters even if they knew where to send them.
[Framme] 
So, you haven't been home even once since you 
ran away?
[Kagetsu] 
I have not.
[Framme] 
That's awful! If I were your family, I'd be super 
worried about you.
[Framme] 
Hey, I've got ink and paper here. You should 
write a letter to your family right now!
[Framme] 
I'm sure they'd be thrilled to hear from you.
[Kagetsu] 
Write to my family? No, no, absolutely not.
[Framme] 
Aww... But it was such a good idea!
[Kagetsu] 
It is kind of you to worry, but this is my burden 
to bear.
[Kagetsu] 
I do appreciate your offer to help. Thank you, 
little friend!
[Framme] 
"Little"?!

[Kagetsu] 
Hmm, no... This is not right...
[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps if I...

[Framme] 
Hellooo, Kagetsuuu!
[Kagetsu] 
Ah!
[Kagetsu] 
Framme! You...startled me.
[Framme] 
Did you just hide something real quick? What 
were you doing in here?
[Kagetsu] 
No. Absolutely not. I have never hidden things.
[Framme] 
Wow, are you a terrible liar! If you're not hiding 
anything, you won't mind if I look around...
[Kagetsu] 
No! Framme, do not look!
[Framme] 
Hm? What's this paper?
[Framme] 
Oh! Waitâ”€is this a letter?!
[Kagetsu] 
Yes.
[Framme] 
Ah, I'm sorry! Here, take it back. I didn't read 
any of it!
[Kagetsu] 
It is OK. I had not truly started, so there is 
almost nothing to read.
[Framme] 
You're writing a letter after all? You were 
so against it before.
[Kagetsu] 
I felt...compelled to take up pen and paper.
[Kagetsu] 
Only now that I have, I do not know how 
to begin. I do not know what to write.
[Framme] 
Oh, don't be silly!
[Framme] 
Just tell them what's happened to you lately. 
They want to know you're still alive.
[Framme] 
I'll help you out, if you want. Just write to 
them, OK?
[Kagetsu] 
Framme...you are most kind.
[Kagetsu] 
To concern yourself with me and my family 
in this way is exemplary. Thank you.
[Kagetsu] 
With your support, I will face this blank page 
and roundly defeat it.

[Kagetsu] 
...
[Framme] 
Hey, Kagetsu. Why the long face?
[Kagetsu] 
Hello, Framme. Ah, you mean to say that 
I appear sad.
[Framme] 
Still no response to your letter?
[Kagetsu] 
None indeed.
[Kagetsu] 
It appears my family really has given up on me.
[Framme] 
No! There was probably just some issue getting 
the letter delivered.
[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps there was. Perhaps it is for the best.
[Kagetsu] 
I do not know that I would be courageous 
enough to read their reply if I received one.
[Framme] 
Hey, what happened to the guy who stared 
down a blank page and defeated it?
[Framme] 
And there could still be a response on the way. 
It's too soon to give up. Have some faith!
[Kagetsu] 
Faith, you say...
[Framme] 
Just wait a bit longer, OK? And then we'll 
write a response together!
[Kagetsu] 
You are right. I have been impatient.
[Kagetsu] 
While we wait, perhaps you would show me 
what your parents wrote to you?
[Framme] 
Huh?
[Kagetsu] 
That letter there in your hand. Is that not what 
your parents sent to you?
[Kagetsu] 
I am curious to see what your family has to say. 
Only if it is OK with you, of course.
[Framme] 
Oh, uh, sure. It's probably just the usual 
stuff, anyway.
[Framme] 
Let me just see what it's about first... Hmm... 
Mm-hmm... Ah!
[Kagetsu] 
What has surprised you? Hmm, let me see...
[Kagetsu] 
We heard from Vander... Stop goofing around... 
Train harder...
[Kagetsu] 
They are scolding you!
[Framme] 
AHH! Don't look at this one anymore!
[Kagetsu] 
Hm. It appears I need to help you with 
your training.
[Framme] 
No, you don't!
[Kagetsu] 
You helped me write my letter. I owe this 
to you.
[Kagetsu] 
It is simple reciprocity between friends.
[Framme] 
I liked this better when it was about your 
problems...
