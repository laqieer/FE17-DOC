[Framme] 
Lapis! Hey, Lapis! I heard you're a bear killer. 
Is that true?




[Lapis] 
Well...yes, but please keep that a secret.
[Framme] 
Why? That's so cool!
[Lapis] 
Uh...I don't know.
[Framme] 
Lapis, you have to take me bear hunting.
[Lapis] 
Something tells me that you're not taking this 
seriously. Bears are really dangerous, you know.
[Framme] 
I am serious. I really, really am.
[Framme] 
I heard a vicious bear was spotted in the forest 
near here. Lots of people are nervous about it.
[Framme] 
I volunteered to take care of it, but Vander shut 
that down immediately.
[Framme] 
He said, "You're not ready for that, Framme." 
Isn't that mean of him? I just want to help.
[Lapis] 
I'm pretty sure Vander said that out of genuine 
concern for your safety, Framme.
[Framme] 
Nope! He definitely thinks I'm too much of a 
scatterbrain to confront a wild bear.
[Framme] 
I need to prove I'm a worthy steward. Will you 
help me take that bear down, Lapis? Pleeease?
[Lapis] 
Oh, Framme...
[Lapis] 
All right. If you really are serious about this, 
I'll help you hunt that bear.
[Framme] 
Really?!
[Lapis] 
But you'll need to listen carefully and follow my 
instructions. Wild bears are very dangerous.
[Framme] 
I will, I promise. Thanks for BEARing with me, 
Lapis, hehe!

[Framme] 
OK, this is the area where that ferocious bear 
was last spotted.
[Lapis] 
Keep your guard up, Framme. The bear could 
approach from any direction.
[Framme] 
Really? Uh, OK...
[Lapis] 
The most important thing is to stay calm. Don't 
make any sudden movements or loud noises.
[Framme] 
Got it. If the bear gets the drop on me, I'll just 
play dead. That's the key to survival, right?
[Lapis] 
No, don't play dead. If a bear is threatening you, 
it's important to stand your ground.
[Framme] 
Oh. Huh, you really do know a lot about bears.
[Lapis] 
I had to learn all of this back in the countryside. 
Bears used to attack our village all the time.
[Lapis] 
They would trample and uproot our crops, 
undoing months of hard work...
[Lapis] 
My village never had a lot of food to go around. 
Attacks like that became a fight for our lives.
[Framme] 
Wow, Lapis. I had no idea. No wonder you're 
so strong.
[Lapis] 
I don't want people to know about my country 
upbringing. Please keep this between us, OK?
[Framme] 
Got it. Your secret is safe with me. I'm learning 
so much! I can feel myself getting stronger alrâ”€
[Framme] 
...
[Lapis] 
Framme? What's wrong?
[Framme] 
Buh. B-b-buh...
[Lapis] 
Buh?
[Framme] 
BEEEEAR!

[Framme] 
Where...am I?
[Lapis] 
Framme? Oh, phew! Welcome back. You saw 
the bear and passed out.
[Framme] 
Ah! The bear! I remember now. Where is it? 
Are we safe?!
[Lapis] 
We're fine. I managed to scare it off.
[Framme] 
Oh no, that's what I wanted to do! I'm sorry, 
Lapis. I was just so surprised.
[Lapis] 
It's OK. Let's call it a day and head back. 
We could both use some rest after this.
[Framme] 
...
[Framme] 
I guess I need to try harder...

[Lapis] 
...
[Lapis] 
HYAAAH!
[Lapis] 
Phew! That takes care of that.
[Framme] 
That was amazing...
[Lapis] 
Framme! What are you doing out here?
[Framme] 
I saw you sneak off to this forest alone, so 
I snuck off after you.
[Framme] 
I watched you take down that huge bear all 
by yourself.
[Lapis] 
Uh...
[Framme] 
You left me behind on purpose, right? Because 
I mess things up?
[Lapis] 
Oh, Framme, I'm so sorry. That bear was just 
too dangerous. I didn't want you to get hurt.
[Framme] 
Yeah. I understand...
[Lapis] 
I mean it, Framme. And for what it's worth, 
I think you did great just now.
[Framme] 
Doing what? Nothing?
[Lapis] 
You stayed perfectly quiet and still while I was 
fighting that bear, didn't you?
[Framme] 
Well, yeah, but that's not...
[Lapis] 
So you did better than last time. And you'll do 
even better next time. That's growth.
[Framme] 
Oh, Lapis!
[Lapis] 
Aw, don't cry! Come on, let's fix up some 
lunch, OK?
[Framme] 
Lunch? But we didn't bring any food.

[Lapis] 
Here you go! Bear soup, hot and fresh.
[Framme] 
Whoa, this looks so tasty!
[Lapis] 
Mmm. It smells good too. Ah, this really takes 
me back. We used to make this a lot back home.
[Framme] 
You don't want people to know you're from the 
country, but you really loved living there, huh?
[Lapis] 
Heh, I guess you're right. I have a lot of really 
great memories...
[Lapis] 
Anyway, let's eat. Just be careful. It's really hot.
[Framme] 
WAH! HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT!
[Framme] 
Aww, I burned my tongue...
[Lapis] 
Oh no. I tried to warn you!
[Framme] 
It smells so good, though...
