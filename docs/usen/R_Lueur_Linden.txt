=== Alear & Lindon ===
--- C ---



[Lindon]
Are you ready to begin, Divine One?
[Alear]
I think so, Lindon.
[Alear]
But I do want to double-check one last thing.
[Alear]
This experiment will somehow result in making
people's lives easier and happier, right?
[Lindon]
Absolutely, Divine One.
[Lindon]
What I learn by examining you is certain to lead
to a new discovery or three.
[Lindon]
I anticipate very interesting results relating to
quality sleep.
[Alear]
Quality...sleep?
[Lindon]
You dozed for one thousand years, after all.
[Lindon]
It's fair to say no one has ever slept more
soundly than you. Maybe we'll find out why.
[Alear]
Do you really think that's likely?
[Lindon]
I most certainly do! This could be a godsend
for those who struggle with insomnia.
[Alear]
I hadn't thought of that. All right, sure. I'd love
to help with your experiment.
[Lindon]
I greatly appreciate it, Divine One.
[Lindon]
The first step is to cast Thunder on you a few
times to see how your body reacts.
[Lindon]
You'll grow numb to the pain soon enough, but
your hair may not survive the experience.
[Alear]
You know, I've changed my mind. Sorry, but
you'll have to find another test subject.

[Alear]
I keep thinking back to what you were saying
about sleep, Lindon.
[Lindon]
Ah, greetings, Divine One.
[Alear]
I'm still a firm no on that experiment, but I do
want to talk about it with you.
[Lindon]
Are you sure you want to waste your time
visiting this old codger?
[Lindon]
There are so many others you could talk to
who'd have a real impact on your life.
[Alear]
What's gotten into you? Is this because you
got a talking-to from Vander?
[Lindon]
...
[Alear]
He wasn't happy to hear you might have burned
my hair off.
[Lindon]
Er... Well, no use dredging up the distant past,
I always say.
[Alear]
I know it won't happen again. So let's put it
behind us and talk about sleep.
[Lindon]
I'm relieved to hear you don't hold a grudge,
but even so, I don't know how much use I'll be.
[Lindon]
Find a more practical and efficient use of your
time, or you'll regret it down the road.
[Alear]
Well, I'd hate to waste any time, it's true.
[Alear]
I of all people know how fleeting it can be.
[Lindon]
Well said. Now then...
[Alear]
All the more reason why we should sit and have
this talk without delay, Lindon.
[Alear]
There's a lot I want to ask, and any more back-
and-forth would be impractical and inefficient.
[Lindon]
Well─ But on the other hand─
[Lindon]
Hmph. Too smart for your own good, I say!
[Lindon]
But have it your way. Whatever wisdom I've got
is at your disposal.

[Lindon]
My, but you're a quick study, Divine One.
[Alear]
I have a good teacher.
[Lindon]
Ha ha. Cheap flattery won't win me over.
[Lindon]
Ahh, but I never thought I'd live to see this day.
[Lindon]
A former royal knight of Elusia sitting with the
Divine Dragon for a chat.
[Lindon]
If I could somehow go back and tell my younger
self about it, I don't think I'd believe me.
[Lindon]
...
[Alear]
Something on your mind?
[Lindon]
Just a request of the Divine Dragon from
someone who has been around a while.
[Lindon]
Stay alive. No matter what foulness you see in
this life.
[Alear]
Lindon?
[Lindon]
Among my many days were some so trying that
I was tempted to give up and die.
[Lindon]
But something always came along afterward
that made me glad I lived to see it.
[Lindon]
My friendship with you, Divine One, rates high
among those happy occasions.
[Alear]
I'm touched that you'd say so.
[Lindon]
Push hard through those bleakest of nights
toward the dawn where things seem brighter.
[Lindon]
If there's one bit of wisdom I'd want today's
youth to heed from me, it's that.
[Alear]
I'll take it to heart.
[Alear]
Although I should mention, Lindon...
[Alear]
You talk a lot about how long-lived you are,
but you realize I'm actually far older, right?
[Lindon]
Hahaha! I suppose you are, at that!
[Lindon]
You see? Every day's a surprise! Hahaha!

[Lindon]
So this is the Pact Ring. I can tell already that
there's great power bound up in it.
[Lindon]
You don't mind if I experiment with it a bit, hm?
First, I'll test its reaction to Thunder...
[Alear]
Wait, stop! That ring is very important.
[Lindon]
Hahaha, just winding you up, Divine One.
[Lindon]
So, is there some reason you're showing me
this ring?
[Alear]
I was hoping you'd wear it.
[Lindon]
Hm. I suppose I could, but why?
[Alear]
As a sign of our partnership.
[Lindon]
Um...pardon?
[Lindon]
What's gotten into you?! Why would you want
a partnership with me, of all people?
[Lindon]
I thought you were bright, but you're proving
yourself an utter fool!
[Lindon]
I'm far too old to enter into something new with
anyone now.
[Alear]
I beg to differ. We work well together. This ring
is a sign of the partnership we already have.
[Alear]
We're stronger together. I want to seal that
bond in the hopes of saving the world.
[Lindon]
It has to be me, eh? There's no one younger?
I only have so many years left.
[Lindon]
You do this, and you'll end up feeling like I did
the day I lost my wife.
[Lindon]
Nothing but sorrow for you lies down that road.
[Alear]
Right now matters more to me.
[Alear]
You're alive now. I draw inspiration and
strength from you now.
[Alear]
Besides, even if I choose someone younger, I'm
a dragon. I'd outlive any of them anyway.
[Lindon]
Hm...
[Alear]
Do you really think I'm a fool to ask this of you?
[Lindon]
...
[Lindon]
No, you aren't. If one of us is being foolish
here, it's me.
[Lindon]
You came to me in need, and I brushed you
off without a second thought.
[Lindon]
Give me the ring, and I'll give you whatever I've
got left.
[Alear]
I appreciate that. Really and truly.
[Lindon]
Ah, listen to me! I sound so ungrateful.
[Lindon]
Thank you for this gift, .
[Lindon]
I'll make sure that it's worth your while. Now,
shall we go save the world?
