The world's cutest is here to wake you up!


You're a picturesque sleeper, you know that?
Actually, I should draw you.
For posterity's sake.
I'll just make sure I've got the cheekbones 
right, and...there we go!


Good morning!
Oh, this?
A little sketch I did of you sleeping.
I think I'll put it up in the café.
Aw, why not?


You're just like me, Divine One.
You wake up refreshed and looking great!


--- C2 ---

Only me.
Just here to make your room super cute...


OK, here we go.
Ribbons, flowers, bells...
Hmm. Gonna need a bigger bell...
Perfect. Let's see how this sounds.


Whoa, too loud, too loud!
Sorry about that, Divine One!
I was trying to give you a cute surprise.
I'll clean this up!


Oh, good morning!
You caught me before I could surprise you.
I'll get you next time, though.

Divine One, I need your advice.
It's about Camille, my wyvern...


Still out, huh?
The Divine Dragon never seems to lack 
for sleep.
Probably rests easy every night, just like me.
Almost as cute, too. Almost.


Sorry to wake you!
My wyvern's having trouble sleeping.
She wants to play all the time.
I thought you might know a way to help her 
calm down...
though I've never seen a wyvern sleep like that.


Good, you're up.
Camille hasn't been getting enough sleep.
Since you get so much...
could you give me advice to help her find 
some rest?


--- B2 ---

You sure sleep a lot! I get why folks are always 
coming by to wake you up.


I keep reminiscing about our little adventure.
I had such a great time!
I wonder if you're dreaming about it right now...
and you're drooling.


Were you dreaming of a delicious breakfast, 
Divine One?
That was adorable.
As far as I'm concerned...
you deserve a like.


Good, you're awake!
Hey, guess what?
I've heard rumors of another great view.

My search for cuteness has brought me here!


The Divine Dragon's hair is super cute.
I'm jealous of the color.
I wonder how that style would look on me.


Oh, did I wake you?
I'm so sorry! Go back to sleep.
I'm off to search for the next cute thing.


Cuteness found!
An adorable Divine Dragon. My intuition 
never fails.
Oh, I didn't really need anything.
Sorry─get some rest.


--- A2 ---

Hey, Divine One! Can I ask you about a 
drawing? Oh, you're asleep.


I've been thinking.
Scenery is great...
but it might be nice to branch out.
Hmm, what should I draw next? How about... 
this bug?


Aw, you don't like my bug drawing?
In that case...
you find my next subject.
C'mon, let's go!


Good morning!
I wanted to ask...
if you'd mind me drawing your portrait.
You're adorable...
and I wanna capture that.

I'm here to see the cutest in the world!


Still out cold.
Tired of being the world's cutest already, huh?
It can be an exhausting job. I should know.
You brought this on yourself, though, being 
so adorable.
Well, my friend...
It's time to get out there. The world needs you.
Open your eyes, Divine One.


There you are! Awake at last.
Are you ready to assume the responsibilities 
of the world's cutest?
I'm here to support you anytime you need it.
That's what friends are for.


Did you mind me calling you that?
I'm not out to embarrass you. You're my friend.
Really, it's just my way of saying...
that I appreciate you.


--- S2 ---

Guess who?
Hahaha! Like you wouldn't know the voice of 
your closest friend in a heartbeat.


Oh, that's my hair clip.
I'm glad you keep it close.
I've got the gift you gave me too.
The Pact Ring...
I'm tempted to draw a picture of this thing and 
show it off.
I don't think I'm actually gonna do that, though.
Some things are too special to share with the 
rest of the world.
I wanna keep this just between us.


Morning. You're even adorable in your sleep.
I should draw you snoozing, so the whole world 
can see.
Nah, I wouldn't do that to you.
I just wanted to see your reaction.


Morning!
What? You really didn't recognize my voice?!
Haha, you liar!
It's bad enough you're cuter than me now.
You don't have to go teasing me on top of it.
