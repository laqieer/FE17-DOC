=== Fogado & Yunaka ===
--- C ---



[Fogado]
Hey, Yunaka! I'm headed to a party right now.
You wanna come along?
[Yunaka]
Party? Why?
[Fogado]
Ah, not feeling it, huh?
[Fogado]
You're always in such high spirits, I thought
you'd be game.
[Fogado]
But hey, no worries. I'll see you when I have
some other business. Take care.
[Fogado]
[Yunaka]
...
[Yunaka]
He came at me so fast I forgot to put
my act on!
[Yunaka]
I better fix this fast. He'll expose the real me
if I don't.
[Yunaka]
Heeey! Fogaaado!


[Fogado]
What's up?
[Yunaka]
Zappy! I was totally yanking your bowstring.
I love raucous carousing in enclosed spaces!
[Fogado]
You sure you're not forcing yourself?
[Yunaka]
Don't be ridiculous! Parties are fun! I love fun!
[Yunaka]
Take me to the parties. Every single one.
All of them!
[Fogado]
Ahh, so I had you pegged right. Good. Knew
we'd get along.
[Fogado]
In that case, come on! Let's head to the party!
[Fogado]
Play hard or don't play at all, am I right?
[Yunaka]
Dang right! Hehe...heh...

[Fogado]
Hey, I'm sorry for dragging you to that party.
I didn't realize it wasn't your kind of thing.
[Yunaka]
No, that's on me. I'm sorry for running off like
that in the middle of all the fun.
[Yunaka]
The truth is, I... I'm not comfortable in crowds.
[Yunaka]
Surrounded on all sides like that, you never
know who might be out for blood.
[Fogado]
Wait. Did I hear that right?
[Yunaka]
Um...probably not? Forget it. Not important.
[Yunaka]
I'm just anxious around people, is the thing.
[Fogado]
Seems like there's some baggage there...
Anyway...
[Fogado]
I promise not to drag you along like that again.
I'm sorry you had a bad time.
[Yunaka]
No, no. Don't worry about it. Thanks, though.
[Fogado]
Heh.
[Fogado]
Tell me something. What do you think of me?
[Yunaka]
Of you? Well, let's see...
[Yunaka]
I think you're someone who wants to make
every day as fun as it can be.
[Yunaka]
I envy that about you, to be honest.
[Fogado]
If you want some of these good vibes...
try showing people a little trust.
[Yunaka]
Trust?
[Fogado]
Some folks are real pieces of work, no doubt.
[Fogado]
But if you always keep your walls up, you might
miss out on making new friends.
[Yunaka]
Are you saying that's the trick to enjoying life
the way you do?
[Fogado]
That's exactly what I'm saying.
[Yunaka]
Thanks for the pep talk, Fogado.
[Yunaka]
I'm going to take it to heart. I'm going to try
to start trusting people more.

[Yunaka]
Fogado! Hi! Hey!
[Fogado]
Hey, Yunaka! You've got a real spring in your
step today.
[Yunaka]
I do! And it's all thanks to your advice. I've been
going out of my way to show folks some trust.
[Yunaka]
It's amazing how quickly they've warmed up.
I've been having so much fun! Great trick!
[Fogado]
Huh, so that's what's going on.
[Fogado]
You make it sound like people are acting
different, but actually, they're the same as ever.
[Yunaka]
What? No way. Wait, really?
[Fogado]
Yeah. Most folks are basically good. You just
didn't give them a chance before.
[Yunaka]
So you're saying it was...me who changed.
[Fogado]
Yup. Honestly, it's a remarkable turnaround.
[Yunaka]
Do you know what this means, Fogado?!
[Yunaka]
I've unlocked the secret to having a nice time!
Every day's gonna be an adventure now.
[Fogado]
Well then, how about it? Does the new and
improved Yunaka want to go to a party?
[Yunaka]
Ah, well...about that. I'm still pretty
uncomfortable with crowds.
[Yunaka]
I can choose to trust people, but it's a lot
harder to control an instinctive reaction.
[Yunaka]
I still feel like a party could be fun, though!
[Yunaka]
So, how about this. We'll say getting me to go
to parties is...something to work on.
[Yunaka]
I want to get past my fear of people. I want to
enjoy life the way you do.
[Fogado]
At this rate, I'm sure you'll be out-partying me
in no time at all.
[Fogado]
But we'll take it step by step. How about today,
you and I go out for a meal?
[Fogado]
We'll start small. A nice, quiet place with not
too many people.
[Yunaka]
Oh, that's perfect! I like the way you think!
[Yunaka]
Someday we'll be at some fancy ball or other
and we'll look back on this and laugh! Ohoho!
[Fogado]
Whoa, whoa! Who let the party animal out of
her cage?
[Yunaka]
Zappy! You know it's all your fault!
