[Etie] 
Hey, Panette. How's it going?
[Panette] 
Quite well, thank you.
[Panette] 
You appear to be in good health yourself, Etie.
[Etie] 
Yep. Good eye.
[Etie] 
Hmm.
[Etie] 
Hmm... Hmph.
[Panette] 
Hm... Is something the matter?
[Etie] 
Oh, sorry. I'm being rude.
[Etie] 
Ahem.
[Etie] 
Panette, your stylish fashion sense and refined 
speech are peerless.
[Panette] 
Why, thank you. That is most kind.
[Etie] 
There's just one problem.
[Panette] 
Oh?
[Etie] 
You're hiding something.
[Panette] 
Whatever do you mean? I assure you, I am not.
[Etie] 
You carry yourself like a noblewoman, but... 
you are not one. I smell a fake.
[Panette] 
Why, that is...ludicrous! Slanderous, even!
[Etie] 
So you won't admit it. Fine.
[Etie] 
If being blunt won't work, I'll have to 
get sneaky.
[Etie] 
See you around, Panette.
[Panette] 
Good gracious. Where did that come from?

[Etie] 
Sorry in advance, Panette...
[Etie] 
HYYYAH!
[Panette] 
What the?!
[Panette] 
Who's there?!
[Panette] 
Whoever it is, you got three seconds to show 
yourself before I crack your skull!
[Panette] 
Three... Two... One...
[Etie] 
Cool it, will you?! It's me!
[Panette] 
Huh?!
[Panette] 
Etie? What the heck are you doing here?
[Panette] 
I mean... Etie! Heh, how very unexpected!
[Etie] 
Heh heh, got you, Panette. You went and 
showed your true colors.
[Panette] 
Whatever do you mean? I was merely, uh...
[Etie] 
Don't bother denying it.
[Etie] 
All that hoity-toity stuff is just for show. 
Right then? That was the real you.
[Etie] 
This noblewoman act is completely phony.
[Panette] 
No! I already told you, that is simply not true!
[Etie] 
What are you so upset about? I didn't mean it 
in a bad way.
[Panette] 
How else could you possibly mean it?
[Etie] 
I've got to run, but I'll explain some other time. 
Take care.
[Panette] 
Um, all right. Farewell, then.

[Etie] 
Hey there, Panette. Sorry for ambushing you 
the other day.
[Panette] 
I must say, you gave me quite a fright.
[Etie] 
I didn't do it to be mean.
[Etie] 
I just wanted to get past that front you put up.
[Etie] 
And the reason I did it is because...in a sense, 
I'm the same way.
[Panette] 
You mean...you are of common birth as well?
[Panette] 
You were a wild, vulgar runaway who picked 
fights with anyone who crossed her path?
[Etie] 
Not all of THAT, but... Here. Go ahead and 
feel my abs.
[Panette] 
If you insist...
[Panette] 
Good gracious me!
[Panette] 
These are muscles?! It feels as if you are 
smuggling bullion in here.
[Etie] 
Yeah. I work out. You know any other 
noblewomen with abs like these?
[Panette] 
I suspect there's nary a one.
[Etie] 
I might look like a lady, but deep down, I'll 
never be one. You've heard that too, I bet.
[Panette] 
Yes, indeed I have.
[Etie] 
I knew it!
[Etie] 
I thought I was the only one in the world with 
this problem, but now there's two of us.
[Etie] 
Maybe we can help each other out.
[Panette] 
I would like that.
[Panette] 
Haha, though its start was somewhat unusual, 
I think this will be a wonderful friendship.
[Panette] 
Etie and Panette, the rampaging redheads! 
Heaven help any fool who crosses us!
[Etie] 
I got you a gift! Since we're gonna be friends 
and all.
[Panette] 
My, what gorgeous flowers!
[Etie] 
They grow in my hometown. They're associated 
with eccentric ladies and true connections.
[Etie] 
Seem fitting to mark the start of a friendship 
between two tough gals like us.
[Panette] 
It is as though this breed of flower was made 
just for us. How very touching.
[Etie] 
I think we'll have a lot to learn from each other. 
Don't you?
[Panette] 
Certainly! To start, perhaps you can tell me how 
you managed that sneak attack.
