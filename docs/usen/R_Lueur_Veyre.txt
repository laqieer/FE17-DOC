=== Alear & Veyle ===

[Veyle]
Hmm...
[Alear]
Veyle...why are you looking at me like that?
[Veyle]
I just... Are you really OK?
[Alear]
I really am. I mean, it was strange...taking
Corrupted form and waking up from that...
[Alear]
But I'm fine now. And it's all thanks to
you, Veyle.
[Veyle]
I'm relieved.
[Veyle]
I... I also wanted to apologize for everything
I've done. Everything I did in the past.
[Veyle]
So many people died. And it's because of me.
I was too weak. It's my fault they're dead.
[Veyle]
I know I can't be forgiven, not completely. But if
you could, even just a little... I'm so sorry.
[Alear]
Oh, Veyle. It wasn't your fault. The Fell Dragon
was controlling you. He's to blame─not you.
[Alear]
You say you're weak, but it was your strength
that freed you from him. That's impressive.
[Veyle]
Thank you.
[Veyle]
I'll get stronger too. Like I said before, I want to
be a dragon like you─ready to save the world.
[Veyle]
And I'll do everything in my power to make
that happen. I just hope...you'll help me?
[Alear]
Absolutely. That's what a big brother is for.
[Alear]
Absolutely. That's what a big sister is for.
[Alear]
I'll do anything I can to help you. It's the least
I can do to make up for not being around.
[Alear]
Don't worry. I'm right beside you, little sister.
We can do this together.
[Veyle]
Yes, we can.

[Veyle]
Do you remember when you gave me
the dragonstone?
[Alear]
I wish I could say I did... But everything from
before I woke up is hazy.
[Veyle]
Well, you and I met just one time, a thousand
years ago.
[Veyle]
Well, you and I met just one time, a thousand
years ago.
[Alear]
We only met once?
[Veyle]
Mm-hmm.
[Veyle]
All of our siblings had died in the war.
[Veyle]
You were the only one to survive, and you
came to see me.
[Veyle]
You were the only one to survive, and you
came to see me.
[Veyle]
I was very young then─frail and frightened─
and you handed me the dragonstone.
[Veyle]
You told me that you couldn't stay by my side
but that you were still with me no matter what.
[Alear]
Oh, so I said that to you...all that time ago...
[Veyle]
You did. The dragonstone is shattered, but it
was my protective talisman for a very long time.
[Veyle]
I held it close when Mama died and when Papa
returned and said horrible things to me.
[Veyle]
I knew that as long as I had the dragonstone,
I could be strong...and hold on until I saw you.
[Alear]
Veyle, I...
[Veyle]
Even if you can't remember what you did,
I am still so grateful.
[Veyle]
If you hadn't given me the dragonstone, we
never would have found each other again.
[Alear]
I'm grateful too. To think you held me in your
heart all those years...
[Alear]
Without you, Veyle, I wouldn't be standing here
right now.
[Veyle]
Now that we're reunited, we'll be together
forever, right?
[Alear]
That's right. Nothing can separate us ever again.

[Veyle]
Hehe, I had so much fun today!
[Veyle]
So this is what it feels like to have family.
[Alear]
Veyle, there's...something I'd like to ask you.
[Alear]
How do you feel about our father? About
Sombron?
[Veyle]
Oh...
[Alear]
Soon we'll have to face him. Not as his children,
but as his enemies. So...I had to ask.
[Veyle]
Yes...
[Veyle]
Papa hurt so many people in the past. And now
he's doing it again. He is...evil.
[Veyle]
He's never shown me kindness. I'm not sure he
thinks of me at all.
[Veyle]
Still...
[Veyle]
He is family, just like you. So I can't hate
him entirely.
[Veyle]
He is family, just like you. So I can't hate
him entirely.
[Alear]
I understand.
[Veyle]
Sometimes I just wish I could be part of a happy
family. But I know that's a silly dream.
[Veyle]
At the very least, I hope I can stop Papa before
he hurts anyone else.
[Veyle]
No, I will stop him.
[Veyle]
So, that is how I feel about our father.
[Alear]
Thank you for telling me, Veyle. I feel the same.
[Alear]
The time for reconciliation is long past. I will
use all of my power to stop Sombron.
[Alear]
But I won't be able to do it without you.
[Veyle]
Don't worry. You and me and the rest of our
friends...we'll stop him together.
[Veyle]
Don't worry. You and me and the rest of our
friends...we'll stop him together.
[Alear]
OK. Let's do this, Veyle. Then, when it's all
over, our future can truly begin.
[Veyle]
Yes. For our future.

[Veyle]
There you are! I have something I want to
give you.



[Veyle]
There you are! I have something I want to
give you.
[Alear]
Oh?
[Veyle]
It's for you! I hope you love it.
[Alear]
What a beautiful stone! It's so clear and blue.
You went looking for it, just for me?
[Veyle]
I did. I wanted to give you something in return
for the dragonstone you gave me so long ago.
[Veyle]
I've poured all of my energy into it so, if we
get separated again, we can find each other.
[Alear]
We really are siblings, it seems.
[Veyle]
What do you mean?
[Alear]
Veyle, I also have something I'd like to give you.
[Veyle]
This is...the Pact Ring!
[Alear]
Yes. It's for you, Veyle. You're my dear sister
and the person most precious to me.
[Veyle]
But...
[Alear]
I can't imagine giving this ring to anyone else.
[Veyle]
I can't accept this. This is very special to you,
Divine One.
[Veyle]
I'm the one who took Lumera's life! I don't
deserve it.
[Alear]
That's not true. You do deserve it, and I want
you to have it.
[Alear]
Besides, I know Mother would want this. She
would want both of us to be happy.
[Alear]
No matter what.
[Veyle]
...
[Veyle]
I understand. I will take it, then.
[Veyle]
You gave me the dragonstone and I made it my
talisman. This ring─it will be my new one.
[Alear]
That makes me happy.
[Alear]
I know how much the dragonstone meant to
you. I hoped this could replace it.
[Alear]
No, not so much replace it...more like symbolize
something new─our bond as siblings.
[Alear]
Of course, I had no idea you'd go and give me a
pretty stone before I could give you this ring!
[Veyle]
I'm glad I did. I like that we think so similarly.
[Alear]
You gave me the stone so that we'd always be
able to find each other...
[Alear]
But I'm not going anywhere, Veyle. You and
I are family, and we're sticking together.
[Veyle]
The ring and the stone...they can remind us
that we never have to be apart again.
[Veyle]
OK, let's win this war and bring peace to the
world...for Lumera. She would like that.
[Alear]
Yes, she would. And we can do it together.
[Veyle]
I swear on this ring... I'll stand by your side and
be a dragon who's ready to save the world.
