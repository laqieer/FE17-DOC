=== Byleth & Alfred ===

--- C ---



[Alfred]
I did all that training so I could fight for my
country. But it doesn't feel great that I have to.
[Byleth]
Then let's move swiftly and end the war so
that we can all put our blades down for good.

--- B ---



[Alfred]
Hah! Hrah! Guh-GRAH! Whew! I'm about ready
to call it a day if you are.
[Byleth]
You seem to never get tired of training. Is there
no end to your stamina?

--- A ---



[Byleth]
Alfred? You look like you have something
to say.
[Alfred]
I wondered if you also had a tough time building
muscle. Probably runs in the family, right?
[Byleth]
Actually, my father was rather burly.
[Alfred]
What?! So one day, you might be too?! Boy,
do I envy you. If that happens, show me!

=== Byleth & Anna ===

--- C ---



[Anna]
How goes it, Professor? Anything I can do
for you?
[Byleth]
Oh, no. I just came to see if you were someone
I knew once.

--- B ---



[Anna]
There's got to be something I can do to make
people buy more stuff. Any ideas, Professor?
[Byleth]
Maybe you could make some of your goods
limited-time offers. That might entice buyers.

--- A ---



[Anna]
Survey time! What products do you most wish
I would stock?
[Byleth]
I used to love fishing on my days off, so I guess
I'd like it if you sold rods and bait.
[Anna]
Great suggestion! Although it's sad to know
you don't have a use for them yourself.
[Byleth]
I'm not too upset about it. It would make me
happy just to see people have fun fishing.

=== Byleth & Bunet ===

--- C ---



[Bunet]
So, there was a dining hall at the school in your
world. I'm intrigued to hear about the cuisine.
[Byleth]
I hate to disappoint you, but the fare wasn't
what you'd call a culinary achievement.

--- B ---



[Bunet]
I've heard you know how to cook, Byleth. Could
you teach me some recipes from your world?
[Byleth]
I'd be glad to. But first things first... We must
find out if the same ingredients exist here.

--- A ---



[Bunet]
Thanks to you and your recipe, the meal was a
success, and everyone is satisfied.
[Byleth]
Excellent, I'm glad I could help.
[Bunet]
Everyone but me, that is. I must learn more
dishes from your world. Teach me, Professor!
[Byleth]
Haha, how could I possibly say no? I'll teach
you as many recipes as you like, Bunet.

=== Byleth & Boucheron ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
There you are, Boucheron. Alfred's been
calling for you.
[Boucheron]
Ah, thanks. Um, one moment, though─can you
direct me to where exactly he is?

--- B ---



[Byleth]
You must be back from your workout if you're
that sweaty. You always do give it your all.
[Boucheron]
If only. I've actually been lost all night,
wandering around trying to find my room.

--- A ---



[Byleth]
I see you fish as well, huh? There's something
I haven't done in too long.
[Boucheron]
You're into fishing too?! Perfect! You can come
out to the lake with me next time.
[Boucheron]
Unless it'll be boring for you to just watch.
[Byleth]
Not at all. I'm looking forward to it.

=== Byleth & Céline ===

--- C ---




[Céline]
I have heard that you were once a great lover of
tea. What would you discuss at teatime?
[Byleth]
Let's see... Things we were thankful for, our
crushes, gripes about everything. The usual.

--- B ---



[Byleth]
You seem to be in a good mood. What's
the occasion?
[Céline]
The bird I've been watching came and landed
on my shoulder. What an unexpected joy.

--- A ---




[Céline]
Would you mind having a look at this, Byleth?
I intended it as a gift for you.
[Byleth]
A flower? But why?
[Céline]
Since you can't drink your favorite teas, I
thought that this peony might help soothe you.
[Byleth]
That's very thoughtful, Céline. Thank you.
It's a beautiful flower.

=== Byleth & Chloé ===

--- C ---



[Chloé]
This must all be a lot to take in. If you have any
questions, you can always ask me.
[Byleth]
That's very kind of you, Chloé. I'll do my best
to return the favor however I can.

--- B ---



[Chloé]
I'm interested in fairy tales from your world.
Would you mind sharing some with me?
[Byleth]
I don't know that many, but how about "Loog
and the Maiden of Wind"?

--- A ---



[Chloé]
Did your world have its own rare folk foods?
[Byleth]
Folk foods? Let me think... I had rocky burdock
a few times.
[Chloé]
Wow! What a name! It sounds pretty tough,
though. Was it hard to eat?
[Byleth]
I admit that it was. But it was good medicine,
and eating it always filled me with strength.

=== Byleth & Citrinne ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
Allies should always work to understand each
other. What's most important to you, Citrinne?
[Citrinne]
I suppose I care about my allies the most! You
cared just as strongly for your students, right?

--- B ---




[Citrinne]
I'd love to hear one of your lessons, Professor.
I think I'll pay for a lecture hall to be built here...
[Byleth]
Just for one of my lectures? What's wrong with
the buildings we already have?

--- A ---




[Citrinne]
Everyone just loved your lecture, Professor!
Would you consider giving another sometime?
[Byleth]
Another lecture? I wouldn't mind, but...
[Citrinne]
Oh, of course! Increased attendance calls for a
proper school. I'll begin the preparations now!
[Byleth]
An entire school just for my lectures? That's a
bit much...but I trust you'll do it right, Citrinne.

=== Byleth & Clanne ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
Clanne, do you need anything? I've felt you
staring at me for some time...
[Clanne]
Nope. I'm just admiring you, Professor.
Wait! Professor?! You noticed me?!

--- B ---



[Byleth]
Clanne, would you mind telling me about
yourself? I know next to nothing.
[Clanne]
I know more about the Divine Dragon, but OK.
What do you want to hear?

--- A ---



[Clanne]
You never smile or...anything, so it's hard to tell
how you feel. But it turns out you're really nice!
[Byleth]
What did I do that gave you that impression?
[Clanne]
You always look out for me, say hello, and treat
me like we're equals. It makes me happy.
[Byleth]
I am pleased you feel that way, and I hope we
can continue working together.

=== Byleth & Diamant ===

--- C ---



[Diamant]
You were a mercenary before you began to
teach, right? You seem accustomed to battle.
[Byleth]
Do I? I guess I'm not very aware of how I come
across on the battlefield.

--- B ---



[Diamant]
Tell me, Professor... Do you have any proven
methods for instilling confidence in someone?
[Byleth]
Earnest praise delivered often. When they do
something well, make sure they know it.

--- A ---



[Diamant]
War is built on hatred. That hatred bears new
tragedies of its own. There is no reason for it...
[Byleth]
I'm surprised to hear you speak like this. I had
assumed you were always hungry for battle.
[Diamant]
I do think a strong military is important, but
only if it serves the common citizens.
[Byleth]
I agree. Wars offer little to gain and much to
lose. You'll make an excellent king, Diamant.

=== Byleth & Etie ===

--- C ---




[Etie]
Sorry, can we chat later? I've really gotta focus
on my muscle training right now.
[Byleth]
Didn't I see you doing that earlier today? Your
zeal reminds me of my students.

--- B ---



[Byleth]
I've said it before, but your and Alfred's mania
for training reminds me of my students.
[Etie]
They got to spar with you, I bet. Talk about
a prime teaching opportunity!

--- A ---



[Byleth]
Are you having dinner...again? But didn't
everyone just eat together?
[Etie]
You have to eat right along with your exercise
or you'll lose muscle mass.
[Etie]
If anything happened to my abs after I spent so
long on them, I'd probably cry.
[Byleth]
That makes sense. It's very thorough of you.

=== Byleth & Fogado ===

--- C ---




[Fogado]
You're a hard one to pin down aren't you,
Byleth. A bit of a mystery, you might say.
[Byleth]
So I've been told. Though I can't say that I find
myself to be anything but quite normal.

--- B ---




[Fogado]
Tell me more about yourself, Byleth. I want to
get to know you─the real you.
[Byleth]
I thought we were close already. But tell me
what you'd like to know. I have nothing to hide.

--- A ---




[Fogado]
I think I finally get you, Byleth. You're a
free-spirited sort, is all.
[Byleth]
This may be the first time I've ever been called
that. What makes you say so?
[Fogado]
You're not beholden to others, and you treat
everyone as equals. I like that about you.
[Byleth]
Ah, I think I understand. As it happens, I like
those very same things about you, Fogado.

=== Byleth & Framme ===

--- C ---



[Framme]
Professor! I'm so excited you're here and on
our side. I've been dying to shake your hand!
[Byleth]
I would very much like to, but a friendly wave
will have to do.

--- B ---



[Framme]
Aw, Professor, I did it again! I was trying to help
out, I swear, but I messed everything up.
[Byleth]
It's all right. Turn your failures into learning
experiences and they won't be failures at all.

--- A ---



[Framme]
You're so nice, Professor. I bet your students
loved having a teacher like you.
[Byleth]
I enjoyed being a teacher. But it's fair to say my
students taught me many things as well.
[Byleth]
Just like you, Framme. You've taught me a lot
and for that, I'm very grateful.
[Framme]
Aww, you're making me blush. I feel like
I should be the one thanking you.

=== Byleth & Goldmary ===

--- C ---



[Goldmary]
You haven't complimented me once today,
Byleth. There's no need to hold back, you know.
[Byleth]
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks?

--- B ---



[Byleth]
That was quite a dramatic sigh. What's wrong?
[Goldmary]
Merely lamenting that my talent is impossible
for most to fathom. The curse of greatness.

--- A ---



[Goldmary]
My village is famous for its hot springs.
[Byleth]
That sounds great. We had a sauna back at the
academy. We used to relax in it after training.
[Goldmary]
Sharing a sauna with your students? Were you
not worried about being too familiar with them?
[Byleth]
Oh, no─I was pretty informal with my students,
but I always kept a respectful distance too.

=== Byleth & Hortensia ===

--- C ---



[Hortensia]
I don't get it, Professor. I abused your power.
How can you pretend like that never happened?
[Byleth]
I'm not pretending. I just don't see any reason
to chastise someone who already feels remorse.

--- B ---



[Hortensia]
I hate that I fought against everyone here. But
the worst thought is...what if I had won?
[Byleth]
There's no use worrying about what could have
been. It's in the past now. Look to the future.

--- A ---



[Hortensia]
You know, Professor, you're nothing like any
teacher I've ever had.
[Byleth]
I used to get that all the time. Probably because
I started teaching at such a young age.
[Hortensia]
That's not what I mean. I think it's because
we're close friends. I feel...seen. Listened to.
[Byleth]
Good, because you are. I'm happy to listen
to you anytime you like, Hortensia.

=== Byleth & Ivy ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
Has something happened, Ivy? You seem a little
out of sorts.
[Ivy]
I was thinking of my father, that's all.

--- B ---




[Ivy]
However much thought I give my father now,
no good can possibly come of it.
[Byleth]
I disagree. It can help you come to terms with
the loss. And you will always have his memory.

--- A ---




[Ivy]
You've lost your father as well, have you not?
[Byleth]
Yes...and it wasn't until after he was gone that
I realized how irreplaceable he was to me.
[Byleth]
But that realization made me appreciate others
in my life─to cherish them while I have them.
[Ivy]
I respect that. I only hope I can muster the same
strength to overcome and move on.

=== Byleth & Jade ===

--- C ---




[Jade]
I'm not one to talk, but I've noticed that you
often wear the same expression─even in battle.
[Byleth]
I've been told people have a hard time reading
my emotions. I'm not sure how I feel about that.

--- B ---



[Byleth]
Are you OK, Jade? You look a bit weary. Let me
know if you need to rest for a while.
[Jade]
Thanks, but I'm fine. Just worked a bit late last
night. Surprised you could read that on my face.

--- A ---




[Jade]
By the way, I write novels. I know it's an odd
hobby for someone like me.
[Byleth]
I don't think it's odd at all. I know there's a
complex person under all that armor.
[Byleth]
But I am curious to know what kinds of stories
you write. May I read some of them?
[Jade]
Of course, Professor. Heh, I saw you smile.
We'll see if I can get a full laugh out of you next.

=== Byleth & Jean ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
You seem to be in a good mood, Jean.
[Jean]
Yeah! A soldier I'd been treating for some time
finally recovered. I was so worried about him.

--- B ---



[Jean]
Professor, could you teach me how to fight?
I'd like to be more useful, even if just a little bit.
[Byleth]
If that's what you want, then sure, I'll give you
lessons. We'll start with self-defense.

--- A ---



[Jean]
What do you think, Professor? Am I a good
enough fighter yet?
[Byleth]
It's good that you want to do your part, but you
should look after yourself first.
[Jean]
I know that. I really do...but I see all that's
happening, and I can't help myself.
[Byleth]
You know... Follow your instincts, Jean.
I'll watch out for you.

=== Byleth & Kagetsu ===

--- C ---



[Kagetsu]
Byleth! Why did you abandon mercenary life
for teaching? Did you not enjoy your freedom?
[Byleth]
Of course. But I wouldn't have met my students
if I'd remained a mercenary. I have no regrets.

--- B ---



[Kagetsu]
I am happy to say that our bond of friendship
has become intensely strong, Byleth.
[Byleth]
I'm glad we're friends, but that's a rather
intense choice of words, don't you think?

--- A ---



[Kagetsu]
I will tell you my secret. As one with whom I
share such close bonds, you deserve to know.
[Byleth]
You're being unexpectedly serious. What is it?
[Kagetsu]
I have inherited powers of foresight from my
mother. I can tell you exactly what is for dinner!
[Byleth]
I guess I can see how that would be useful,
but doesn't it ruin the surprise?

=== Byleth & Lapis ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
You eat your meals with such enthusiasm,
Lapis. Tell me, do you have a favorite food?
[Lapis]
Let's see... I've always been a big fan of taters.
They're nutritious and filling.

--- B ---



[Lapis]
In Brodia, if you've got what it takes, even a
country bumpkin can end up as a royal retainer.
[Byleth]
So many people feel burdened by their origins.
It's good that Brodia offers equal opportunities.

--- A ---



[Lapis]
Thanks for always lending an ear, Professor.
I guess those rumors about you are true.
[Byleth]
Rumors? What rumors?
[Lapis]
That you're a really good listener! Talking to
you always makes people feel better.
[Byleth]
It does? Really? That would explain why people
keep confiding in me...

=== Byleth & Lindon ===

--- C ---




[Lindon]
I'm a scholar but not a professor. You have
more experience in matters of mentorship.
[Byleth]
I think you could be a good professor. I started
as a mercenary, and I managed it somehow.

--- B ---




[Lindon]
Indulge me, Professor... I'm researching novel
uses for magic, but I've been coming up short.
[Byleth]
How about magic to create blessed jelly?
Let me see if I can remember the recipe...

--- A ---



[Byleth]
We get more reluctant to try things as we grow
older. That's what impresses me about you.
[Lindon]
Well, one never knows until one tries.
[Byleth]
You're not scared that you might fail?
[Lindon]
Haha! What is failure, really? Discovering which
methods don't work is a success in itself.

=== Byleth & Louis ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
Sorry for making you wait on me, Louis, but
you are pretty helpful.
[Louis]
There's no need to apologize. Waiting on people
is what I do best.

--- B ---



[Byleth]
What's this? A sachet of black tea? It smells
nice.
[Louis]
I had it specifically made for you. You can at
least enjoy the scent, if not the taste.

--- A ---



[Louis]
I saw you watching our chef with no small
fascination. Are you a cook yourself?
[Byleth]
Yes. I used to like cooking quite a bit.
[Louis]
Hmm. A professor who cooks, eh? Now that's
an intriguing prospect.
[Byleth]
Are you OK, Louis? Did we lose you?

=== Byleth & Alear ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
The fighting won't let up anytime soon. If it gets
too much for you, you can lean on me.
[Alear]
Thank you. I should count myself lucky to have
so many friends looking out for me.

--- B ---




[Alear]
Oh, Professor! Sorry, I know I'm not one of
your students. I just wanted to see how it felt.
[Byleth]
I don't mind. It's what most everyone called
me, after all.

--- A ---




[Alear]
Before you were a professor, you were a...
mercenary? What do mercenaries do?
[Byleth]
They're fighting forces for hire. We went to war
for nations without belonging to them.
[Byleth]
So our allies in one battle might be our enemies
in the next.
[Alear]
Though with enough motive, that could happen
anyway... Thanks for the lesson, Professor.

=== Byleth & Mauvier ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
You want to speak about Veyle? OK. But why
with me?
[Mauvier]
The word is that you are a good listener.
Especially when someone is troubled.

--- B ---



[Mauvier]
Professor. How do you relax? I force myself to
sit for nearly two minutes, but it does not help.
[Byleth]
You can't force yourself to relax. But know that
your friends worry if you overwork yourself.

--- A ---



[Mauvier]
Lady Veyle told me to "get a hobby."
[Byleth]
That's a good idea. Having a hobby helps
you relax.
[Mauvier]
With no room in life for pleasures until now, it
is a difficult task to choose one for myself.
[Byleth]
Perhaps Veyle could help you in your search.
She will enjoy it too.

=== Byleth & Merrin ===

--- C ---



[Merrin]
Your moves are very cool, Professor. Of course,
my moves are nothing to scoff at either.
[Byleth]
Ah, is that so? I'll be sure to take a closer look
next time I have a chance.

--- B ---



[Merrin]
I want to be a great knight. You taught at the
Officers Academy─tell me, what's your advice?
[Byleth]
What I can tell you is this... All the knights I've
known were steadfast to their very core.

--- A ---



[Byleth]
You seem to be enjoying that book, Merrin.
What is it about?
[Merrin]
It's an encyclopedia of rare critters. I absolutely
adore learning about them.
[Byleth]
You know, I once pulled a legendary fish called
the goddess messenger from a shimmering lake.
[Merrin]
Legendary fish?! Goddess messenger?! That
sounds amazing! I must hear the whole story!

=== Byleth & Timerra ===

--- C ---




[Timerra]
I made up a song for you, Byleth. Here goes...
♪Byleth is the best! I'm so happy we met!♪
[Byleth]
That is a very...distinctive...melody.

--- B ---




[Timerra]
Choir was a thing at your school, right? Because
I've got this new song I'd love to run by you.
[Byleth]
Oh, uh, I am far from an expert on music,
I assure you.

--- A ---




[Timerra]
If you could do anything, what would it be?
And don't say, "fight for peace." Be creative.
[Byleth]
Hmm, I've never really thought about it.
[Byleth]
But now that I am... I think I'd very much enjoy
traveling about with you, Timerra.
[Timerra]
Aw, Byleth. What a sweet thing to say! I'd love
to take you to see all my favorite places.

=== Byleth & Pandreo ===

--- C ---




[Pandreo]
You once lived in a monastery, right? What
would you say to having a prayer together?
[Byleth]
I'm unfamiliar with the manner in which you
worship here, but I'm willing to give it a try.

--- B ---




[Pandreo]
I love to dance, but when I do, my friends call
it the Dance of Darkness and...not in a nice way.
[Byleth]
Ah, well, I do have some dance experience. I'd
be happy to give you some lessons if you'd like.

--- A ---




[Pandreo]
Folks turn to the church when they're troubled.
But sometimes, I don't know how to help them.
[Byleth]
Hmm, I see. Pandreo, sometimes just listening
to a person is the help they truly need.
[Pandreo]
That's really wise, Professor. Would it be OK
if I talked to you about my troubles sometimes?
[Byleth]
Of course. Talk to me anytime. And I hope I
can turn to you for advice as well, Pandreo.

=== Byleth & Panette ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
I found a wooden sword. Is it yours, Panette?
[Panette]
I think not! Someone as dignified as myself
would never wield such a crude weapon.

--- B ---




[Panette]
Now then, Byleth. Today we will once more set
about eradicating those vile bandits.
[Byleth]
Happy to help, Panette. I find your enthusiasm
for the work quite infectious.

--- A ---




[Panette]
Tell me, Byleth, how do you know a true lady
when you see one?
[Byleth]
Well, I believe that a "lady" is someone who
glows from within.
[Panette]
What a curious thing to say. How would one go
about "glowing from within" do you think?
[Byleth]
Inner beauty always finds its way to the surface.
I dare say, Panette, you are a perfect example.

=== Byleth & Rosado ===

--- C ---




[Rosado]
I wish you'd taught at the academy in Elusia.
Class with you would be fun, Professor.
[Byleth]
I mostly told a lot of stories. No reason I can't
tell those to you here, if you're interested.

--- B ---



[Byleth]
Are you OK, Rosado? You're staring at me.
[Rosado]
I've been waiting for your expression to change.
Even once. You're incredibly stoic, you know!

--- A ---



[Byleth]
That's quite a bit of shopping you've done.
Did you buy everything they had?
[Rosado]
Nearly. There were too many cute outfits and
accessories. I can't be expected to resist.
[Rosado]
If I hadn't bought them all now, I would've had
to go back for them later. Why take two trips?
[Byleth]
Of course. Very efficient.

=== Byleth & Saphir ===

--- C ---




[Saphir]
So, we've got a good haul of fish to work with.
Should we grill? Fry? Stew? What do you think?
[Byleth]
How about we make super-spicy fish dango?
My students loved it. Could be to your liking.

--- B ---




[Saphir]
Going from mercenary to professor must've
been tough. Ever worry about getting too soft?
[Byleth]
Actually, having students look up to you is quite
motivating. Made me train even harder.

--- A ---




[Saphir]
Royal knight was the dream, but after the war,
I'll need to find a new way to grow my strength.
[Byleth]
You'd throw away your dream like that? Why?
[Saphir]
If I stick around for peacetime, I'll get rusty.
Won't be any good to my king then, will I?
[Byleth]
Always looking one step ahead. You're a warrior
through and through, Saphir. I respect that.

=== Byleth & Seadall ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
Seadall, what are you doing here? The war
council is about to begin.
[Seadall]
The stars insist my destiny is to remain on this
spot all day. I'll catch up on council news later.

--- B ---




[Seadall]
Why among all that I eat...must savory food
hold such sway? It throws off my dance steps!
[Byleth]
I think the solution lies in being swayed, and
working that into those dance steps of yours.

--- A ---




[Seadall]
You're in excellent shape, Byleth. You'd look
good dressed in dancing attire like mine.
[Byleth]
As it happens, I've taught classes in a similar
outfit.
[Seadall]
Really? That's fantastic. What did the students
think? They must have been very impressed.
[Byleth]
Yes, the reaction was quite positive. Or at
least...I thought so?

=== Byleth & Alcryst ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
You handled that last battle well, Alcryst.
[Alcryst]
Are you saying that I'm not challenging myself
enough? I'll work much harder next time.

--- B ---



[Byleth]
You seem worried about something, Alcryst.
If you'd like to talk about it, I'm here to listen.
[Alcryst]
I'm writing a letter of self-introduction...but I'm
running out of ways to say "worthless burden."

--- A ---




[Alcryst]
When I pass on, I'll be an obscure footnote in
history with no accomplishments to my name...
[Byleth]
Many people do pass on without making their
mark, but I doubt that will be your case.
[Alcryst]
You really think I'll achieve something? My skills
are so lacking... What good could I possibly do?
[Byleth]
My students taught me that everyone finds their
own path. I know you'll find yours too, Alcryst.

=== Byleth & Amber ===

--- C ---



[Byleth]
Hello, Amber. I heard you coming. You're an
easy man to track.
[Amber]
Aw, thanks! It's great to know that I stand out
in a crowd...even when I'm not doing anything.

[Amber]
You were a professor at the Officers Academy,
right? Can you teach me how to win any battle?
[Byleth]
That's hard to summarize, but...it requires both
heightened skill and broadened collaboration.

[Amber]
Your sword is so cool, Professor. It turns into a
whip, right? Can I see how it works?
[Byleth]
I don't see why not. Stand back. Hyah! How
was that?
[Amber]
Whoa! I take it back. That sword isn't cool─it's
SUPER cool! Can you make it do a loop?
[Byleth]
Hya! That was a pretty good loop. I think I'm
enjoying this! Any more requests?

[Byleth]
You always seem so busy, Vander.
[Vander]
There is much to do. And I find it easiest on the
mind to dispense with all my tasks at once.

[Byleth]
Vander, can I help you with anything?
[Vander]
Nay, leave the random chores to this old man.
You have young soldiers to teach, Professor.

--- A ---



[Byleth]
You work too hard, Vander. Can't you delegate
some of your duties?
[Vander]
I've performed my day's work since I was a lad.
It's not at all a burden worth delegating.
[Vander]
Still, I do appreciate your concern, nevertheless.
[Byleth]
I see. Well, please don't overextend yourself. We
need you on the battlefield, not in the infirmary.

[Veyle]
Now that I'm here with everyone, I just feel so
happy. Though, I probably shouldn't let myself.
[Byleth]
You should let yourself. You're our ally now,
Veyle. You have every right to your happiness.

[Byleth]
You look like you're keeping very busy, Veyle.
What are you doing?
[Veyle]
I want to make myself as useful as I can, so I've
been doing little errands for everyone.

[Veyle]
I love spicy food. Did you have any especially
spicy dishes in your world, Professor?
[Byleth]
Oh yes. Super-spicy fish dango was a dish
known for scorching your entire mouth.
[Veyle]
That sounds super yummy! I hope you'll teach
me how to make it sometime.
[Byleth]
I'd be glad to. It will take all our fortitude, but
we shall face this fiery feast together.

[Yunaka]
Geez, you're mysterious, Professor. Not even
my sharp eyes can get a read on you.
[Byleth]
My father used to say the same.

[Yunaka]
So you went from mercenary to professor?
That's a huge career change!
[Byleth]
It's not the most dramatic leap I've seen.
A colleague of mine was once a songstress.

[Yunaka]
This academy of yours sounds pretty neat.
What'd you teach your students?
[Byleth]
Most of the lessons at the Officers Academy
centered around strategy and martial skills.
[Byleth]
It wasn't all about classes, though. There were
lots of other activities─choir, fishing, cooking...
[Yunaka]
That sounds amazing! I'd love a school like that.
Sign me up! How do I apply?

[Zelkov]
Odd of you to want to speak to me, Professor.
I'm afraid I am *preoccupied* at the moment.
[Byleth]
Of course. I'm sorry to disturb you.

--- B ---




[Zelkov]
Battle provides an intense feeling of *purpose.*
When it is over, I often feel lost.
[Byleth]
It's OK to wander aimlessly sometimes. You
never know what opportunities might find you.

--- A ---




[Zelkov]
You are a popular teacher. I *presume* you
are skilled at communicating with children.
[Byleth]
I never thought much about being popular with
my students. I just tried to understand them.
[Zelkov]
*Understand* them. Yes, of course. Such a
simple idea. I will keep it in mind. Thank you.
[Byleth]
Remember that even teachers, for all their
good intentions, can be intimidating.
