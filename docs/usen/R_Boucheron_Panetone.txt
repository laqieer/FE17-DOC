[Panette] 
Pardon, Boucheron. Have you a moment 
to spare?
[Boucheron] 
Of course.
[Panette] 
Forgive me if this seems impertinent, but...
[Panette] 
Are you the son of a Firenese count?
[Boucheron] 
I am.
[Panette] 
Marvelous! I wonder if, as a noble, you might 
deign to do me a favor.
[Boucheron] 
I suppose so. What sort of favor?
[Panette] 
Well, as you know, I serve the crown princess 
of Solm.
[Panette] 
To avoid embarrassing the royal family, I take 
pains to abide by the rules of high society.
[Panette] 
Yet with respect to many noble customs, 
I remain rather...ill at ease.
[Panette] 
Thus, I would like you to instruct me in the 
manners and etiquette of your homeland.
[Boucheron] 
Sure. I can do that.
[Panette] 
Why, thank you!
[Boucheron] 
I've been curious about Solmic etiquette too.
[Boucheron] 
Since we both serve our respective royal 
families, it might be fun to teach each other.
[Panette] 
A splendid idea!
[Panette] 
There is much to be learned, much to be taught!
[Panette] 
I can scarcely wait!
[Boucheron] 
Here's to education!

[Boucheron] 
When using knives and forks, start from the 
outside and work your way in.
[Panette] 
Understood! Let us see here...
[Panette] 
Pah... Pah! Why is Firenese food so slippery? 
It refuses to stay on my fork.
[Boucheron] 
That piece is a bit too large. Use the knife to 
cut it smaller. It looks more graceful that way.
[Panette] 
Smaller pieces... Deuces, this is complicated.
[Boucheron] 
I know you said you were nervous, but I didn't 
realize how little experience you had here.
[Panette] 
Perhaps I ought to drink some water to calm 
my nerves.
[Panette] 
...
[Boucheron] 
Wait, no! That dish is meant for washing your 
hands, not to sip from!
[Panette] 
Pah! How misleading!
[Boucheron] 
How did you manage to eat meals with the 
Solmic royal family?
[Panette] 
I always muddled through by mimicking others.
[Boucheron] 
I suppose there's something to be said for that.
[Panette] 
Alas, perhaps proper etiquette is simply beyond 
my grasp.
[Boucheron] 
Ahh, don't give up so easily. Everyone has a 
hard time learning these things.
[Panette] 
In truth, my home life growing up was far 
from perfect.
[Panette] 
How arrogant of me, assuming I could pass 
myself off as a noble.
[Boucheron] 
The way you were raised isn't that important. 
If you want to learn, I'll teach you.
[Boucheron] 
You might make some mistakes here and there, 
but I'll help you, no matter how long it takes.
[Panette] 
Truly?
[Boucheron] 
Of course. Correcting our mistakes is how we 
learn, after all. Let's try again from the start.
[Panette] 
You're quite right. Look at me, hanging my head 
in defeat.
[Panette] 
From here on, I shall hold it high! I will not let 
you down, Boucheron!

[Panette] 
Before eating, one must sit up straight and pray.
[Panette] 
...
[Panette] 
Then, the humane customs of Firene dictate 
that I offer gratitude to the food itself.
[Panette] 
Giving thanks to the plants and animals that 
compose each meal. What a lovely tradition.
[Boucheron] 1 

[Boucheron] 
Ah... Are you practicing the etiquette we went 
over the other day?
[Panette] 
I am! Please, observe.
[Panette] 
Behold as I expertly wield a knife and fork to 
conquer this dish.
[Panette] 
Using the outside utensils first... Cutting the 
food into small pieces...
[Panette] 
Success!
[Boucheron] 
Congratulations, Panette. You're still a little bit 
shaky, but this is progress.
[Panette] 
Thank you, Boucheron.
[Panette] 
My studies in etiquette were always marked by 
desperation. I wished to claw free from my past.
[Panette] 
But with your tutelage, for the first time, I found 
it rather pleasant learning about manners.
[Panette] 
My success is entirely thanks to you.
[Boucheron] 
Oh no, you worked hard for this. I'm proud 
of you.
[Boucheron] 
I'd say it's my turn now to learn some 
Solmic etiquette.
[Panette] 
What?
[Boucheron] 
Don't tell me you don't remember. We agreed 
to teach each other our countries' ways.
[Panette] 
Ah, yes. I remember.
[Panette] 
Well, Solm is a free-spirited queendom. There is 
no strict code of conduct for nobles.
[Panette] 
Rather, it is considered good manners to revel 
with othersâ”€to sing, dance, and be merry.
[Panette] 
Though of course, some situations call for a 
certain amount of propriety.
[Boucheron] 
Huh... That's interesting.
[Boucheron] 
Every country has its own customs, but I can 
see one point of common ground between ours.
[Panette] 
Kindness.
[Boucheron] 
Yes. That's the foundation of all etiquette, no 
matter what country you find yourself in.
[Boucheron] 
And when it comes to that, Panette, you earn 
a perfect score.
[Panette] 
As do you, dear Boucheron.
[Boucheron] 
I never would have realized all this if you hadn't 
brought it up, so thank you.
[Panette] 
And thank you. It seems I am closer and closer 
to becoming the picture-perfect noblewoman.
[Boucheron] 
By the way, there must be more to etiquette 
in Solm. I'm eager to learn.
[Panette] 
Indeed! Let us continue our education on the art 
of kindness toward others. Together.
