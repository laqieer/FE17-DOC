[Alear] 
Hyah!
[Framme] 
AHH! Divine One, you look so shiny when 
you sweat!
[Alear] 
Hyah!
[Framme] 
Hey! Hey! Look over here! Hey!
[Framme] 
AH! The Divine One looked right at me!
[Framme] 
Thank you, universe, for creating someone so 
awesome and so very...shiny.
[Alear] 
Um...Framme?
[Framme] 
Oh, sorry! Am I distracting you?
[Alear] 
Well, you're not...not distracting me.
[Framme] 
Oops! Sorry, sorry.
[Framme] 
See, I'm here in my capacity as a president of 
the Divine Dragon Fan Club.
[Alear] 
I have a...fan club?
[Framme] 
Yep! Our mission is to support you. That's why 
I'm here giving you extra motivation.
[Alear] 
Huh. Thanks for cheering me on.
[Alear] 
But could you maybe not do it so...close?
[Framme] 
You bet. I can stand back a little.
[Framme] 
Four, three, two, one, who's our favorite 
dragon?! You! You! Y-O-U!
[Alear] 
Ah, that didn't help...

[Alear] 
Hyah!
[Alear] 
Whew. Time to take a short break and get a 
drink of water.
[Framme] 
AHH! The Divine Dragon looks so cool 
drinking water!
[Framme] 
Note for the fan club─the Divine Dragon 
loooves to drink water.
[Alear] 
...
[Alear] 
Hey, Framme? Can I talk to you for a minute? 
It's kind of important.
[Framme] 
You want to have an important conversation 
with ME? Am I dreaming? Is this happening?
[Alear] 
No, you're not, and yes, it is. Look, I'm sorry to 
say this, but...
[Alear] 
Could you take it easy with the cheers 
and whatnot?
[Framme] 
Huh?
[Alear] 
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but really. You're 
making it hard to focus.
[Alear] 
When each battle is more difficult than the last, 
I can't afford to be distracted during training.
[Framme] 
...
[Framme] 
You're... You're right. I wanted to support you, 
but I'm just being annoying.
[Framme] 
...
[Alear] 
Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't intend to─
[Framme] 
No, it's not your fault. I'm only crying 'cause 
I'm so worthless...
[Framme] 
I promise to stay out of your hair from now on! 
Your beautiful, flowing, perfect hair! WAH!
[Alear] 
Aw, Framme...

[Alear] 
Framme, I'm sorry for what I said. I didn't mean 
to upset you.
[Framme] 
Nah, it's OK. I'm sorry for bursting into tears 
like that.
[Framme] 
I've just felt...really attached to you since you 
woke up. No, scratch that.
[Framme] 
Since BEFORE you woke up. I used to sit and 
chat with you about my life.
[Alear] 
Really?
[Framme] 
Yeah. If something exciting happened, I'd tell 
you the good news with a big smile on my face.
[Framme] 
Or if something was making me sad, I'd sit 
next to you and have a good cry about it.
[Framme] 
You were always so easy to talk to. Every single 
day I sat there and waited for you to wake up.
[Alear] 
I... I didn't realize that.
[Framme] 
I knew you couldn't actually hear me. I was just 
living out my own little fantasy.
[Framme] 
But then you woke up! I was so excited to talk 
to you for real, I...I got kinda carried away.
[Alear] 
Framme, I have a request.
[Alear] 
Please go back to cheering for me like you 
did before.
[Framme] 
What?! But you said...
[Alear] 
I did. But that was before I knew you kept me 
company for so long.
[Alear] 
As far as I'm concerned, you can be as loud and 
distracting as your heart desires.
[Framme] 
Oh, Divine One... You're every bit as amazing as 
I always imagined.
[Framme] 
OK. I, Framme, a president of the D.D.F.C., 
swear to continue my wholehearted support.
[Framme] 
As your number-one fan, I'll keep cheering for 
you with all my heart and soul!
[Alear] 
Perfect. I wouldn't have it any other way.
[Framme] 
AHH! THE DIVINE ONE LOOKED RIGHT 
AT ME!

[Alear] 
Hey, Framme! There you are.
[Framme] 
Divine One, it's you! What can I do for you?
[Alear] 
I have something important to talk to you about. 
It's time, I think, to re-evaluate the D.D.F.C.
[Framme] 
Wha...
[Framme] 
I... I tried to make sure my cheering wasn't so 
annoying. I guess it didn't work, huh?
[Alear] 
No, no! That's not it at all.
[Framme] 
Oh, are you promoting the Divine Dragon Fan 
Club to Divine Dragon OFFICIAL Fan Club?!
[Alear] 
No, that's not it either.
[Framme] 
Demoting us to unofficial fan club then...
[Alear] 
Um, definitely not that.
[Framme] 
Well, what is it then, Divine One? Come on!
[Alear] 
OK, OK, here goes. I don't want you to be my 
number one fan.
[Framme] 
WHAA?
[Framme] 
N-no...too painful... Can't breathe...
[Framme] 
If I'm not a fan of the Divine Dragon, then... 
then...who am I even?!
[Alear] 
Whoa, Framme. Please calm down. I don't want 
you to be my number one fan because...
[Alear] 
I want you to be my number one ally.
[Framme] 
Number one ally...
[Framme] 
NUMBER ONE ALLY?!
[Alear] 
You had my back long before I woke up.
[Alear] 
You watched over me on sunny days and on 
rainy days. On happy days and sad days...
[Framme] 
Y-yes! Of course! I'd love to be your number 
one ally! You and me, battle friends forever!
[Alear] 
Well then, Framme, this is for you...
[Framme] 
The P-pact Ring?! But, Divine One, that's 
super valuable. Are you sure?!
[Alear] 
I am.
[Framme] 
WAAAH!
[Alear] 
Oh no, Framme, are you OK?!
[Framme] 
I'm─ I'm just so happy! You didn't just look at 
me, you offered me the Pact Ring!
[Framme] 
I─ I accept! I really, really do!
[Alear] 
That makes me happy, Framme.
[Framme] 
Oh, uh, but just one teensy thing... I don't want 
to stop being your fan.
[Framme] 
I want to be your number one ally and your 
number one fan. Is that OK?
[Framme] 
You mean everything to me. Plus, I think I can 
handle both roles, ya know?
[Alear] 
Hahaha, if anyone can, you can. I am very lucky 
to have an ally and a fan like you.
[Framme] 
Thank you, .
[Framme] 
From now on, I'll be cheering you on and 
standing by your side. Allies for always!
