=== Alear & Boucheron ===
--- C ---




[Boucheron]
Are you all right there, Divine One?
[Alear]
Boucheron? Why do you ask?
[Boucheron]
Oh, I just thought you seemed a little worn out.
[Alear]
Ouch, you noticed? I am feeling sort of sluggish.
[Boucheron]
Hm, that's not good. You're eating three meals
a day, I hope?
[Alear]
Yes. I don't think my diet is the issue.
[Boucheron]
Well then, how about your sleep?
[Alear]
About the usual.
[Boucheron]
Hmm... So you're eating and sleeping fine, but
you still feel groggy.
[Boucheron]
It could be stress.
[Alear]
You think so?
[Boucheron]
I wouldn't be surprised. Going to war is
stressful for anyone.
[Boucheron]
What have you been doing as stress relief?
[Alear]
Nothing. It hadn't even occurred to me. Why,
what do you do?
[Boucheron]
I have several ways to blow off steam.
[Boucheron]
Like going up a mountain alone and spending
some quiet time fishing.
[Alear]
Wow. That does sound relaxing.
[Boucheron]
Would you like to join me sometime? The
"alone" part of it is optional, really.
[Alear]
Yes! I would love that. Please come get me the
next time you head out!

[Boucheron]
How are you liking this mountain air,
Divine One?
[Alear]
It's so clear. Everything about this place
is gorgeous.
[Alear]
Just standing here is doing a lot to clear
my mind.
[Boucheron]
I'm glad it's working as intended.
[Alear]
Is this the stream you mentioned before?
[Boucheron]
Yes. Well, probably. It's got to be one of the
ones around here. I think.
[Alear]
You sound...less than sure.
[Boucheron]
It's this terrible sense of direction I have.
[Boucheron]
I've tried to visit the same spot twice, but I've
never had any luck.
[Alear]
Now you tell me...
[Boucheron]
What's the matter? You seem worried.
[Alear]
I'm suddenly wondering if we're going to be
able to find our way home.
[Boucheron]
Haha, don't worry about that. I've been
breaking tree branches to mark our path.
[Boucheron]
Look over there. See that broken branch?
It shows we came...that way...
[Boucheron]
Huh? Aww...
[Alear]
I'm not seeing it.
[Boucheron]
Ugh...
[Boucheron]
I could swear I broke that branch!
[Alear]
Um, which one?
[Boucheron]
What? None of these branches are broken!
I am so sorry, Divine One.
[Boucheron]
But I think it'll be OK. Let's try going in
this direction!
[Alear]
Actually, let's head the other way.
[Boucheron]
What? Why?
[Alear]
If your sense of direction is that bad, we should
do the opposite of whatever your instinct says.
[Boucheron]
Hm, fair point! Haha, off we go!
--- A ---




[Boucheron]
I feel just terrible about the other day,
Divine One.
[Boucheron]
I hope my poor sense of direction didn't stress
you out even more.
[Alear]
I wouldn't worry too much. We got home safely,
and the whole thing was even kind of fun.
[Boucheron]
Whew. That does make me feel better.
[Alear]
So, how else do you relieve stress?
[Boucheron]
I do enjoy a good book. Diving into a whole
other world helps me forget about ours.
[Boucheron]
I highly recommend this─it's a classic from my
homeland called, "Love in Bloom."
[Alear]
It's very...damp. And wrinkled.
[Boucheron]
Oh, sorry about that. It's from tears.
[Alear]
Excuse me?!
[Boucheron]
It doesn't take much to get the waterworks
going for me. That's why, uh...
[Boucheron]
That's why I get misty just looking at the cover
for this one.
[Alear]
That's all it takes?!
[Boucheron]
Don't be fooled. Reading really is very relaxing.
And this is one of my favorites.
[Alear]
All right, then... Let's see here...
[Boucheron]
Wait! I'm going to need a moment after
seeing the table of contents...
[Alear]
Is this for real?!
[Boucheron]
I'm sorry, Divine One... This can't be very
relaxing. I'll leave you alone with the book.
[Alear]
Are you sure? I really don't mind.
[Alear]
Besides, I think people would start to worry if
they saw you walking around in tears.
[Boucheron]
Uwah... Oh, Divine One, you're too kind! Wait
until we get to the introductory paragraph...
[Alear]
At this rate, we'll finish the war before the
first chapter...

[Boucheron]
You called, Divine One? Is everything all right?
[Alear]
Hello, Boucheron. I've been thinking about your
stress-relief tips.
[Alear]
But the reason I called you here is for
something else altogether.
[Boucheron]
Hm?
[Alear]
You're here so I can tell you three things.
[Alear]
First, I'd like to thank you.
[Alear]
I hope you know that your unwavering support
is always appreciated.
[Boucheron]
Please, think nothing of it. I'm just happy I can
help you in some way.
[Alear]
I must say, your dedication is very charming.
As is your humility.
[Boucheron]
You think I'm charming?
[Alear]
Yes. That was actually the second thing I
wanted to tell you, so...there it is.
[Alear]
But there's one last thing I have to get off my
chest. Here goes...
[Alear]
...
[Alear]
Sorry, I'm just...feeling a little emotional
about this.
[Boucheron]
...
[Alear]
What's the matter?
[Boucheron]
I can't watch you get so emotional without
getting all choked up myself.
[Alear]
That's the kind of all-out supportiveness that
I think makes me like you so much.
[Boucheron]
Hm?
[Alear]
Boucheron, will you take the Pact Ring and
promise to stay with me?
[Alear]
I think we have something special, and I'd hate
to lose that after the war.
[Boucheron]
You─ You mean it? Oh, Divine One, I'm so
happy right now I could cry.
[Boucheron]
But no, I've gotta keep it together long enough
to tell you this.
[Boucheron]
I'm no royal or steward, just an ordinary knight.
But I've always held you in high esteem.
[Alear]
Is that a yes, then?
[Boucheron]
Of course I'll take the ring. It's proof that we're
of the same mind about each other.
[Boucheron]
If you'd have me, I'd follow you to the ends
of the earth.
[Alear]
Thank you, Boucheron. This is cause for
celebration.
[Boucheron]
Haha, you took the words right out of
my mouth.
[Boucheron]
I may get lost in life and feel emotional, but I'll
always find my way with you, .
