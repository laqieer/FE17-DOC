...
[Veyle] 
I thought I was going to die! I mean, I'm pretty 
sure I did die. Twice!
[Veyle] 
I screamed so hard I lost my voice at one point.
[Timerra] 
So, what'd you think of your first time tearing it 
up on wolfback?
[Veyle] 
It was...exciting. But mostly terrifying.
[Timerra] 
Haha! You're such a kidder, Lady Veyle!
[Veyle] 
But I'm not kidding. Not even a little bit.
[Veyle] 
It's a miracle I'm still alive. In fact, I can't 
believe I am alive.
[Timerra] 
Takes your mind off everything though, right? 
Couldn't you feel your worries just...float away?
[Veyle] 
Heh...I guess you could say that.
[Timerra] 
Good. You looked a little tense earlier. I thought 
this might be a good way to unwind.
[Veyle] 
I do sometimes wonder if it's OK for me to be 
here with all of you.
[Timerra] 
I hear ya. But next time you start feeling like 
that, you let me know, all right?
[Timerra] 
We can tear it up to the horizon and back!
[Veyle] 
OK. I will. And Timerra...thank you.

[Veyle] 
I told her I couldn't do it!
[Veyle] 
I told her I wasn't ready to ride a wolf all by 
myself! What was she thinking?
[Timerra] 
Was that fun, or was that fun?
[Veyle] 
I thought I was going to die!
[Timerra] 
I thought you would too! Nearly went right over 
that cliff.
[Veyle] 
I didn't know how to turn! And I didn't know 
I didn't know how until I was already riding!
[Timerra] 
Well, you made it! All you needed was a little 
effort and a positive attitude.
[Veyle] 
All I needed was a miracle.
[Timerra] 
But hey, really cleared your mind, huh?
[Veyle] 
I mean, I was so scared I couldn't actually think. 
So...yes?
[Timerra] 
Good! You're learning. The biggest thrills in life 
always involve a little fear.
[Veyle] 
Hehe...
[Veyle] 
I'm sure you're right, Timerra. It is good to do 
things that make us uncomfortable.
[Timerra] 
Exactly! Now, come on! Round two!
[Veyle] 
What?! Round two? Must I?

[Veyle] 
My goodness, that was so much fun!
[Timerra] 
Hahaha! Looks like somebody's not scared of 
riding wolves anymore.
[Veyle] 
It's true! I've conquered my fear.
[Veyle] 
Thank you so much, Timerra.
[Timerra] 
Don't mention it. Um...is something wrong? 
You look a little misty-eyed.
[Veyle] 
It's just...you always treat me like I'm a 
normal person.
[Timerra] 
All I did was plonk you onto a wolf and say "go."
[Veyle] 
That's it exactly.
[Veyle] 
You treat me like...a friend. It makes me happy.
[Timerra] 
Hehehe! If you're happy, I'm happy. Though, 
I guess I didn't realize all of this was so special.
[Veyle] 
It is. Very special.
[Veyle] 
I don't think I can thank you enough.
[Timerra] 
Aww, it was nothing, Lady Veyle. Honest.
[Veyle] 
Heh...
[Veyle] 
So, I guess you'll be returning to Solm after 
the war is over?
[Veyle] 
You'll probably be really busy...getting ready 
to be the next queen and all of that.
[Timerra] 
Yeah. It feels like my to-do list is as big as 
the queendom itself.
[Veyle] 
I suppose we won't be able to hang out with 
each other anymore, like normal friends.
[Timerra] 
What, you think I'll become a total fuddy-duddy 
when I'm queen?
[Timerra] 
Give me a little credit.
[Timerra] 
I'll sneak out of the palace to hang out with you, 
if that's what it takes.
[Timerra] 
And we will hang out. A lot! No matter what 
my title is. Because that's what friends do.
[Veyle] 
I'd...really like that, Timerra.
[Veyle] 
Yeah, it's a plan!
