=== Louis & Zelkov ===

[Zelkov]
Why are you *staring* at me?
[Louis]
Greetings, Zelkov.
[Zelkov]
I asked you a *question.*
[Louis]
Hah! I meant nothing by it, I assure you.
[Louis]
But if you have the time, might I invite you to
join me for a cup of tea?
[Zelkov]
This *invitation* makes little sense to me. You
and I are not exactly close.
[Louis]
It is because we aren't close that I invited you.
I should like to get to know you better.
[Zelkov]
Dispense with the *pretense,* please. What is it
you want?
[Louis]
My dear Zelkov, I have no ulterior motive here.
I merely thought we could bond over tea.
[Zelkov]
Regrettably, then, I must *decline.*
[Louis]
What a shame. I suppose I'll have to put away
my specially made soothing tea.
[Zelkov]
I do not *understand* you.
[Louis]
Well, it's plain to see that you don't sleep much.
[Zelkov]
I fail to see *your* interest in the matter.
[Louis]
It doesn't impact me directly at all. But as your
friend, I am concerned.
[Zelkov]
This is going *nowhere.*
[Zelkov]
Whatever your *intentions* might be...stay out
of my affairs.
[Zelkov]
[Louis]
My dear Zelkov. You'll find it will take more to
dissuade me than that.

[Louis]
Good day, Zelkov. Would you care to join me for
a spot of tea?
[Zelkov]
Louis, I am beginning to suspect you are
*attempting* to spy on me.
[Louis]
Hahaha!
[Louis]
Very well. I shall be plain with my intentions.
[Zelkov]
At last. By all means, *proceed.*
[Louis]
I would like to take care of you, Zelkov.
[Zelkov]
Excuse me?
[Louis]
You see, I am the eldest of four brothers.
[Louis]
My mother died early on, so I had a tumultuous
upbringing in a house solely of men.
[Louis]
With my father providing for the family, it fell
to me to look after my brothers.
[Louis]
My impulse to take good care of people remains
strong even to this day.
[Zelkov]
And you direct this impulse toward *me*?
[Louis]
Indeed. You strike me as someone who wants
looking after.
[Zelkov]
Thus the incessant *invitations* to tea,
I surmise.
[Louis]
Quite so. In a way, I feel as though you could
be one of my younger brothers.
[Zelkov]
Ridiculous. I am *older* than you, you know.
[Louis]
That matters little to me.
[Zelkov]
I suppose it matters little to *me* as well, so
long as you have no *ulterior* motive.
[Zelkov]
I do understand the *yearning* an older brother
feels to care for a younger one.
[Louis]
Ah! Do you have siblings as well?
[Zelkov]
Perhaps I do.
[Zelkov]
In any case, your efforts are wasted. I have no
*desire* to be cared for.
[Louis]
I suspected you'd say that.
[Louis]
Please forgive me for running roughshod over
your own feelings on the matter.
[Zelkov]
...
[Zelkov]
In lieu of an apology, I will *accept* a relaxing
cup of tea.
[Zelkov]
You possess *leaves* which help to impart
a restful sleep, if I recall?
[Louis]
...
[Louis]
Wait right here, Zelkov! I shall prepare it
at once!

[Louis]
Where are you going, Zelkov?
[Zelkov]
Regrettably, I cannot stay for tea this time.
There is *work* to be done.
[Louis]
That's a shame.
[Louis]
In that case, are there any chores I might take
care of for you?
[Louis]
I could have your place tidied by the time you
finish your work.
[Zelkov]
As I've told you, Louis, I have no *desire* to be
cared for.
[Louis]
Hah, you'll have to forgive me. I can't help but
feel the need to look after you.
[Louis]
I credit this instinct to your strong resemblance
to my brothers.
[Zelkov]
...
[Zelkov]
I had a younger brother. Long ago.
[Zelkov]
Not only a brother, in fact. A family.
[Zelkov]
They were killed.
[Louis]
My condolences.
[Zelkov]
I am uncertain *exactly* why, but...drinking tea
with you reminds me of them.
[Zelkov]
It is painful to remember that what is lost can
never be regained.
[Zelkov]
But the *tea*... The tea is lovely.
[Louis]
Ah, Zelkov...
[Zelkov]
How *foolish* of me.
[Zelkov]
Please *forget* what I've said.
[Louis]
I will not, I think.
[Louis]
I shall await your return with a freshly brewed
pot of tea.
[Louis]
Hopefully that will entice you to return.
[Zelkov]
Hm-hm, you are a *strange* one.
[Zelkov]
But if you *insist* on waiting around for me...then
the least I can do is enjoy the tea.
[Louis]
I'll hold you to that. Now then, off you go!
[Zelkov]
Farewell.
