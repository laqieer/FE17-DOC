=== Paralogue The Azure Twin ===

(Dark Ruins)
A place of significance to Emblem
Eirika. Here, the Divine Dragon
will face an important trial.

--- OP ---





[Eirika]
Look at this place! Oh my. It can't be...
It's impossible!
[Alear]
What's wrong, Eirika?
[Eirika]
This looks almost exactly like... I'd swear to
you, this is where everything changed forever.
[Alear]
Changed? How so?
[Eirika]
I was a member of the royal family of Renais.
[Eirika]
Our close neighbors, the Grado Empire, were
our allies for centuries.
[Eirika]
Then with no hint of warning, the Grado Empire
invaded.
[Alear]
That must have been difficult, if you were allies
for so long.
[Eirika]
As the royal family, my brother and I fought
together with our friends to protect our people.
[Eirika]
The final conflict took place right here.
[Eirika]
I know things only look similar, but it's very
much like being back there.
[Alear]
You don't have to go on. I understand that it's
a painful memory.
[Eirika]
I... I lost a very dear friend that day.
[Alear]
But you didn't lose hope─you fought on.
Even when faced with losing a friend.
[Eirika]
I─ Would you spar with me? Here?
[Eirika]
Everything I feel about that day is bound up.
My heart is full of grief...
[Eirika]
Perhaps fighting here will help overcome that.
Though that sounds like my brother's thinking.
[Alear]
I would be glad to spar with you. However,
I don't plan on losing.
[Eirika]
Well, you wouldn't last long if you didn't try
to win.
[Eirika]
And if you do win, then our bonds will only
become stronger.

[Eirika]
You've gotten stronger. You might even be able
to defeat Ephraim, my brother.
[Alear]
Thank you! I guess you've always relied on your
brother, haven't you?
[Eirika]
I wouldn't... I mean... We're siblings. And we
always need one another's support.
[Alear]
I guess I hadn't thought of it that way.
[Alear]
You should know that I rely on you, Eirika.
I trust your opinions and your skills.
[Eirika]
Thank you. I just want to be a help to your
cause, the same as others helped me.
[Eirika]
I'm so very happy to be part of this and to help
all of you.
[Alear]
You've saved me so often. I'm starting to think
I'd be lost on my own.
[Eirika]
Hehe, you should have more confidence.
[Eirika]
As long as we both trust in our own skills, we
can be there to support one another.
[Alear]
That sounds good to me. I hope you'll continue
to be with us, Eirika.
[Eirika]
I hope so too, . I'm sure you can
save this world.

[Eirika]
Relax

[Eirika]
Now let us begin, !



[Eirika]
Hmm. I see no gaps in your defenses, but that
doesn't mean you'll win easily.

[Eirika]
Fighting you here... It feels so strange.

[Alear]
I feel it too. Facing you like this is making
me stronger.
[Eirika]
Relax

[Eirika]
You've been strong from the start. Now, show
me you have the skills to back up your strength.


[Rosado]
I didn't think we'd get to hang out this much,
Eirika. It's been lots of fun!


[Eirika]
I'm glad that it's you who engaged with me.
Every day is a new experience.

[Rosado]
Aw, thanks so much! Now you've got me
blushing, though...
[Eirika]
Heh. Well, raise your weapon or I'll have to
embarrass you further.

[Goldmary]
Well, Eirika, it's time to see which of us is more
graceful in battle.
[Goldmary]
I'm sorry if my skill proves to be too much
for you.


[Eirika]
No apology necessary. Seeing you grow as a
warrior has been a pleasure.

[Eirika]
But that doesn't mean I plan on losing!
