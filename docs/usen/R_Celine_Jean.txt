=== Céline & Jean ===

[Céline]
I must thank you, Jean.
[Jean]
Princess Céline? What are you thanking me for?
[Céline]
The tea produced in your hometown is far and
away my favorite.
[Céline]
There is joy in each and every sip. So I thought
it appropriate to thank you.
[Jean]
Ah. In that case, I should thank you too.
[Jean]
My mother will be over the moon to find out
you like it so much.
[Céline]
Your mother?
[Jean]
She works at a tea shop back home.
[Jean]
You've probably had tea brewed from leaves
that my mother processed.
[Céline]
I see! Do pass on my thanks, then.
[Jean]
I will. Praise from Your Highness would be
the pride of a lifetime for my mother.
[Céline]
Would you like to join me for tea sometime?
[Céline]
We can brew some tea leaves from your home
and drink to your mother's health.
[Jean]
Oh! I've done nothing to deserve such an
invitation, but I'm grateful anyway.
[Jean]
I'll be looking forward to it!
[Céline]
As shall I. You'll be hearing from me.

[Céline]
Hello, Jean.
[Jean]
Hello, Princess Céline!
[Céline]
Oh, is that a medical text? I'm not interrupting
your studies, I hope.
[Jean]
Don't worry about it. I'm just reading up so
I can be a good doctor.
[Céline]
How exemplary. Perhaps another day, then.
[Jean]
Hmm? Oh, you mean for that teatime?
[Céline]
Yes. A batch of tea from your home arrived,
so I wondered if today would suit you.
[Céline]
But your studies are more important.
[Jean]
I'm very sorry. But thanks for thinking of me!
[Céline]
Teatime is postponed, not canceled, dear.
Our anticipation shall make it all the sweeter.
[Jean]
My hometown's tea must really be amazing.
[Céline]
Haha, you're just realizing this now?
[Céline]
The tea grown in your hometown is nonpareil,
I assure you.
[Jean]
Gosh!
[Céline]
Have you never considered a future in tea?
Taking up your mother's trade, so to speak.
[Jean]
Not really. I like tea, but it can't save lives.
[Céline]
It can't...save lives?
[Céline]
...
[Jean]
Hm? Princess Céline?
[Céline]
I'm sorry, it's nothing. You have studying to do.
I shall take my leave and my leaves.
[Jean]
Well, thank you. I was just at a really fascinating
part of this text!
[Céline]
Be diligent, but don't push yourself beyond
your limits.

[Jean]
Ugh... It's just not sinking in.


[Céline]
Hello, Jean. You appear to be hard at work
with your studies.
[Jean]
Princess Céline!
[Jean]
I've read this chapter over and over, and I'm
just not getting it. My brain is too tired.
[Céline]
I know what you need. Here.
[Jean]
Is that smell...my hometown tea?
[Céline]
It is indeed.
[Céline]
I saw you struggling with your studies and
judged that you were in need of a break.
[Jean]
Wow. Thanks, Princess Céline!
[Jean]
Mmm, this smell... It's so relaxing. It reminds me
a lot of home.
[Céline]
Now, Jean. You mentioned once that you didn't
believe tea could save lives.
[Céline]
But I say to you that your hometown tea has
saved me too many times to count.
[Jean]
Tea...saved you?
[Céline]
When things aren't going well and I'm in low
spirits...that's a sign that it's teatime.
[Céline]
A hot cup of tea in these situations does much
to lift my mood.
[Céline]
Things tend to go better afterward, even if it's
only because I've cleared my head.
[Céline]
When the problems I'm dealing with are severe,
is it an exaggeration to say that tea saves me?
[Jean]
No. I suppose it isn't.
[Jean]
In fact, my own spirits feel pretty lifted now!
[Jean]
Thank you, Princess Céline. I learned something
valuable today, and it wasn't from this book.
[Jean]
I guess, medically speaking, I can't count out
the healing power of tea. Sorry about that.
[Céline]
You have nothing to apologize for. I'm relieved
to hear your mood has improved.
[Jean]
When I get home and see my mother, I'm going
to tell her that our tea is the best in the world.
[Céline]
If she doubts you, I shall visit in person to
inform her that her tea always brings me joy.
[Jean]
Actually, if it's OK with Your Highness, could
we have our teatime now?
[Jean]
Drinking tea alone's no fun, and besides...
I want to talk to Your Highness a little more.
[Jean]
I'll get right back to studying when we're done,
of course!
[Céline]
Hahaha, nothing would make me happier.
[Céline]
To be honest, I was in the mood for some tea
as well. I apologize for speaking out of turn.
[Céline]
Well then, shall we retire to the tea room?
There's so much more about tea to discuss!
[Jean]
Lead the way!
