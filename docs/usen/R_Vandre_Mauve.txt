=== Vander & Mauvier ===
--- C ---


[Mauvier]
Hm-hm...
[Vander]
Mm-hmm...
[Mauvier]
Sir Vander, you are following me. Explain
yourself.
[Vander]
You are a valiant guardsman, alert at all hours.
The people could ask for no better protector.
[Mauvier]
Keeping an eye on me?
[Vander]
Oh, just the one. It's nothing personal.
[Mauvier]
Are you afraid I might switch allegiances again?
[Vander]
I wasn't saying that, no.
[Vander]
Alas, not everyone is convinced you are
trustworthy as of yet.
[Mauvier]
Understandable... There is much for which
I must atone.
[Mauvier]
I hope I might earn your trust, yet I understand
your continued need for surveillance.
[Vander]
It's not really surveillance, per se. I'm just
watching from afar.
[Mauvier]
I am working diligently...so I may be worthy of
everyone's trust.
[Vander]
Working hard is all well and good, but trust is a
precious commodity. Harder to earn than lose.
[Mauvier]
Trust is a precious commodity. So I am aware.
[Mauvier]
Vander hates me as well. Quite understandable,
given my actions towards Queen Lumera.

[Vander]
Back on guard duty today, I see.
[Mauvier]
I feel more at ease when I work.
[Mauvier]
Of course, I apologize that my patrol may make
your continued surveillance more challenging.
[Vander]
Indeed. You are making my life quite difficult.
[Mauvier]
My apologies...
[Vander]
Hahaha, I was joking! Goodness, now. I'm just
doing my job, watching you do yours.
[Vander]
You do as you like. I'm not about to be
prescriptive with how you handle your duties.
[Mauvier]
...
[Mauvier]
Sir Vander, what are your thoughts considering
my past actions?
[Vander]
Well, which particular action concerns you?
[Mauvier]
I am sorry about Queen Lumera. I am especially
sorry it took me so long to speak these words.
[Vander]
What matters is that we are allies. I have no
intention of dwelling on the past.
[Vander]
Were Queen Lumera here, she'd accept you,
Sir Mauvier. Therefore, I'll do so in her stead.
[Mauvier]
You do not hate me for what I have done?
[Vander]
Why would I do that? To what end?
[Mauvier]
...
[Vander]
No point in going on with that attitude.
[Vander]
I've watched you long enough now to know that
you're a good person at heart.
[Vander]
Keep in mind, your life will bring you plenty of
opportunities to set things right.
[Mauvier]
Sir Vander... I appreciate your concern for me.
And also your advice.

[Mauvier]
I have a request of you, Sir Vander.
[Vander]
A request? How intriguing. Let's hear it.
[Mauvier]
...
[Mauvier]
Would you tell me more of Queen Lumera?
[Vander]
Of Queen Lumera?
[Mauvier]
I wish to know as much as possible about the
woman who died...because of me.
[Vander]
So be it, then.
[Vander]
However, I have so many memories of Queen
Lumera that it's difficult to pick one to share.
[Vander]
Ahh... Yes, that's the one.
[Vander]
A piece of silverware─a fork, passed down the
generations at Lythos Castle─was stolen.
[Vander]
A search for the thief revealed the fork was
taken by a lady-in-waiting.
[Vander]
Before acting, I asked Queen Lumera, how to
deal with the thief. She said to do nothing at all.
[Mauvier]
...
[Vander]
I said if the thief were not made an example of,
then the guards' reputation would be tarnished.
[Vander]
I was deeply troubled at the time.
[Mauvier]
And what happened?
[Vander]
The next morning, the fork had been returned
to its proper place.
[Vander]
I never learned why she stole the fork, or what
she hoped to do with it.
[Vander]
But Queen Lumera understood the situation
and solved it without effort or intervention.
[Mauvier]
...
[Vander]
That is the sort of person Queen Lumera was.
Always kind. Always striving for peace.
[Vander]
She was a truly magnificent person, loved and
respected by one and all.
[Mauvier]
If only I could have known then the powerful
regret that I would know today...
[Vander]
You protect people from harm. You're carrying
out her will, whether you intend to or not.
[Mauvier]
I am happy that you feel that way, but I cannot
yet agree.
[Mauvier]
How different life might have been had I met
someone like you much earlier...
[Vander]
It may be late, but we have met, and that means
you're on the right path.
[Mauvier]
I fear that not everyone will accept who I am.
[Mauvier]
Yet I swear to earn their trust as I have
earned yours.
[Mauvier]
It is my duty to do so. For the queen.
