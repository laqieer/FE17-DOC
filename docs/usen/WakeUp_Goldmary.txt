I'm here to wake you up, if that's all right.


Still asleep, are you? Perhaps my voice is a 
touch too soothing.
That's all right. Feel free to enjoy your rest 
a while longer.
Wake up at your leisure.


Good morning.
Are you happy to see me?
Of course you are.


Oh, you woke up right away.
I'm sorry.
I might be a bit too good at this.

Here I am, fresh off a morning bath.


There's only one problem with my 
morning routine.
Once I get in the bath, I don't want to get out.
The rest of the world is cold and dirty...


Good morning.
You know...
I went out of my way to help you start your day.
That deserves to be acknowledged.


Good morning. Ready to face the day?
You should begin with a refreshing bath.
Nothing will put you in a calmer mindset.

I'm sorry, but you need to wake up immediately.


Ugh! I can't believe how late I slept.
Why don't my friends come by to wake me in 
the morning?
I suppose they don't want to disturb me...


Sorry...
It took quite a bit of effort to wake you...
and it's already noon.
Excuse me? I'm sorry, what?
Are you actually suggesting I'm the one 
who overslept?


Surpriseâ”€you slept until noon.
Feeling refreshed?
I thought you needed the rest...
so I decided to sleep in. You're welcome.


--- B2 ---

I wonder how others go about waking you...


I thought I could easily get anyone wrapped 
around my finger...
Why is the Divine Dragon immune to 
my charms?
What do I need to do differently?


Ah. You're awake.
You meant it when you said I was charming, 
right? Could you do me a favor?
Could you say it again?


Ah. You're already up.
I guess my talents aren't required here...
unless you want to go back to sleep, of course.
It is still early, you know.

My idea is perfect.
No one else will have thought of this, I'm sure 
of it.


I've prepared a little surprise for you.
The most calming way to wake.
Listen to the flowing water, and be transported.
Isn't it soothing?


Good morning.
How was that?
Relaxing? Revitalizing?
There's no need to thank me...but go on and 
do it anyway.


You're up.
I understand if you're eager to see me...
but I didn't even get to use my new 
wake-up technique.
Could you be more considerate of my needs?


--- A2 ---

The most popular person in the world is here 
to wake you.


Well... Maybe second most.
You're obviously more popular than I am...but 
that's all right.
I'll take Elusia...
and you can have the rest of the world.


Good morning.
I wanted to thank you again for telling me 
you found me charming.
My confidence is back now...
and it's all because of you.


You got up quickly.
Don't tell me you were in suspense 
or something.
You had to know it couldn't have been anyone 
but me.


--- S1 ---

Your perfect partner is here to wake you...


My voice isn't enough to wake you?
You must be very tired.
You're the most hard-working person I know.
I truly admire that.
I know I'm not normally the type to flatter, 
but for you...
I'll make an exception.
That's just one of the perks you get for being 
my partner.
Another is that I love you.


Good morning.
Does the sight of me fill you with happiness?
Wait, what? It really does?
I was only teasing you, you know...
You're so sincere it throws me off.


Good morning.
Are you as happy to see me as I am to see you?
I'm so lucky to have you all to myself.
The rest of the world will have to miss out.


--- S2 ---

Are you awake yet? Or still asleep?
Either way, I'm here to see you.


Too busy dreaming about me to wake up?
Hah, I told myself I'd stop doing that.
Instead of pretending I know what your 
feelings are...
I'll just tell you mine.
Awake or asleep, I'm happy to spend time 
with you.
You already know why that is, but I'll say 
it again.
It's because I'm in love with you.


Does it make you happy to be woken up by 
your perfect partner?
I'm sorry...
but the happiest one in the world is actually me.
That's because I was given a beautiful ring...
by the love of my life.


Good morning.
Since you're up early...
why don't we spend a little time together?
I relish every moment we get to spend alone.
It's when I feel closest to you.
