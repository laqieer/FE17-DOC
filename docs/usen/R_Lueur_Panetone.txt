[Panette] 
HYAAA!
[Alear] 
That was incredible!
[Panette] 
Yes. Learn to strike with that much force and 
you are sure to trounce all comers.
[Panette] 
In truth, I was rather surprised when you asked 
me for lessons in brawling.
[Panette] 
I take it you wish to give someone a forceful 
talking-to. A debtor, perhaps?
[Alear] 
What? No, nothing like that.
[Alear] 
I figure that I could lose my weapon when I'm 
in battle or get ambushed when I'm not.
[Alear] 
Just in case, it's best I learn how to hold my 
own in physical combat.
[Panette] 
I see. That is quite shrewd, Divine One.
[Panette] 
Very well. I shall instruct you in the ancient art 
of the fisticuffs.
[Panette] 
How to hone an indomitable spirit. How to 
repel foes with a mere scowl.
[Panette] 
There is much I can teach you.
[Alear] 
I see. Well, I'm ready to learn!
[Panette] 
Good. I will make you into the most fearsome of 
scrappers. Let us begin!

[Panette] 
In a brawl, the most crucial blow is the first. 
Victory oft rests on attacking before your foe.
[Panette] 
Thus, you must be agile─agile enough to strike 
with a raptor's swiftness!
[Alear] 
Be agile. Got it.
[Panette] 
That way, even if your enemies do attack first, 
you will be able to evade their fists.
[Alear] 
Makes sense...
[Panette] 
Is something the matter, Divine One?
[Alear] 
I'm just surprised that a noblewoman like you 
knows so much about brawling.
[Panette] 
I suppose there is no need to obscure the truth. 
The woman standing before you is not a noble.
[Panette] 
Why, in time past, she was quite wild indeed.
[Alear] 
Really?!
[Panette] 
Yes. My parents were awful─gallivanting about 
with nary a thought for their children.
[Panette] 
So I fled. Before the princess appointed me, 
I lived a roaming, solitary life.
[Panette] 
It was then that I learned how to fistfight.
[Alear] 
I'm sorry you had to endure all of that.
[Panette] 
Sorry? If not for running away from that 
wretched home, I would hardly be who I am.
[Alear] 
I see. Well... Would you like to tell me more 
about your past?
[Alear] 
I think it might help me to hear about your life 
before you met Princess Timerra.
[Panette] 
Why, of course.
[Panette] 
If my stories of woe can help you, I would be 
all too happy to share them.

[Panette] 
Aw, damn. I guess it won't be so easy to find 
them after all.
[Alear] 
Panette? You're up late.
[Panette] 
Ah! Good evening, Divine One!
[Alear] 
What's that letter you're reading?
[Panette] 
I employed a Solmic investigator to find my 
parents. This is her report.
[Panette] 
Alas, it seems the search has come up empty.
[Alear] 
Huh. I thought you said your parents were 
horrible people.
[Panette] 
Yes, well... Our conversation made me realize 
I have some feelings in need of resolution.
[Panette] 
I thought perhaps now, with the benefits of 
time, I could speak to them with a cooler head.
[Panette] 
Thus my desire to track them down...assuming 
they are still alive, of course.
[Alear] 
I'm impressed. It's brave of you to try facing 
them after all these years.
[Alear] 
Panette, how about I help find your parents?
[Panette] 
No, no... I would not dream of such 
an imposition!
[Alear] 
It's the least I can do to repay you for 
your training.
[Alear] 
Besides, we've seen our share of dangerous 
battles together.
[Alear] 
You, me, the others─we have a connection. 
We help each other. Let me help you, please.
[Panette] 
Very well, then. I will gratefully accept your aid.
[Panette] 
Truth be told, even if we do not find my 
parents, I have already found my family.
[Panette] 
What more do I truly need?

[Alear] 
No word on your missing parents today, I take 
it? Don't lose hope yet. We'll keep looking.
[Panette] 
Divine One... I have come to the conclusion that 
it is time to abandon the search for my parents.
[Alear] 
But...why?
[Panette] 
It is regrettable, but we have searched high 
and low. There is nothing more to be done.
[Panette] 
That said, I thank you, sincerely. You have been 
a steadfast companion throughout.
[Panette] 
Searching for my parents with you has been... 
enjoyable. I hope we can continue on together.
[Alear] 
If that's what you want, Panette, then yes, 
I would like to continue on with you. Always.
[Panette] 
I─ I don't understand...
[Alear] 
I told you before we had a connection, but it's 
more than that. I mean, I want us to be more.
[Alear] 
Please, take this.
[Panette] 
That's...the Pact Ring.
[Alear] 
You're supposed to give it to someone you 
care for deeply. For me, that's you.
[Panette] 
Divine One...I─ I cannot.
[Panette] 
My parents were once wildly happy with one 
another. But in time, their relationship soured.
[Panette] 
People's feelings change. I cannot bear the 
thought of that happening to us.
[Alear] 
That was your past, Panette. You have a whole 
future ahead of you.
[Alear] 
Everyone has their ups and downs. You and 
I too─good times and otherwise.
[Alear] 
But you have the agility of a raptor, and now 
so do I. We can evade anything together.
[Panette] 
Haha! Over and over again, you astonish me, 
Divine One.
[Panette] 
I see I've impressed upon you the importance of 
agility. But what of the rest of the brawler's art?
[Alear] 
Nothing to do with us. So, what do you think? 
Will you accept this ring?
[Panette] 
Yes. I will, gladly.
[Panette] 
Stay with me, from now until 
forever, .
[Alear] 
Of course. I am your partner and you are mine.
[Panette] 
I like the sound of that.
[Panette] 
I can think of no one I'd rather fight beside. 
You are the one I truly adore.
