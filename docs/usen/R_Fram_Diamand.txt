[Diamant] 
Who's winning the staring contest, you or that 
history book?
[Framme] 
Ah! Prince Diamant! Sorry, I didn't notice you 
come in.
[Diamant] 
No need to apologize, Framme. What's got you 
so frustrated? Anything I can help with?
[Framme] 
I messed up some of my steward duties again, 
so Vander gave me an ongoing "study duty."
[Framme] 
He was all, "You never take your role seriously," 
and, "The least you can do is educate yourself!"
[Diamant] 
Ah, so Vander gave you that book. Doesn't look 
like you're enjoying it very much.
[Framme] 
History is so boring! It's just wars, border 
disputes, wars, trade stuff, more wars...
[Framme] 
Why does everyone have to fight all the time? 
Why can't everyone just relax and be friends?
[Diamant] 
History does tend to be a chronicle of warfare. 
That's been true since the first Fell Dragon war.
[Diamant] 
It's not all battles and bloodshed, though. 
For instance...
[Diamant] 
My ancestors were able to found Brodia thanks 
to Lumera's protection, not open warfare.
[Diamant] 
You really do learn a lot by studying history. 
Vander has the right idea.
[Framme] 
Eh. If you say so...
[Diamant] 
Heh, just keep reading. It's not all dates and 
trivia, I promise. These are stories about people.
[Framme] 
Yeah, I guess you're right. I haven't even made 
it very far... It's kind of draining.
[Diamant] 
Ah. Right. Must be hard to read about past wars 
in the middle of a new one. But don't worry...
[Diamant] 
You have my vow as the crown prince of Brodia 
that, when I'm king, there will be peace.
[Framme] 
Wow. Really, really?
[Framme] 
A vow from the crown prince of Brodia is good 
enough for me!
[Diamant] 
Heh heh, I mean it. Rest easy, OK?
[Framme] 
Ha! I will. But only after I've read some more of 
this not-so-boring book!

[Diamant] 
Hello, Framme. Did you forget the history book 
today? Or did you already finish it?
[Framme] 
I...quit studying history.
[Diamant] 
You quit? What happened? I thought you were 
finally having fun with it.
[Framme] 
Prince Diamant... You said you wanted to bring 
peace to the world, but...
[Framme] 
Is that really true?
[Diamant] 
Of course it is. I would never lie about that.
[Framme] 
Then why does Brodia keep attacking Elusia?
[Diamant] 
Well...
[Framme] 
I read the histories of both kingdoms. There are 
helpless citizens in Elusia that fear Brodia.
[Framme] 
When you talk about ending war, do you really 
mean conquering Elusia? Is that peace?
[Diamant] 
...
[Framme] 
The more I read in that history book, the less 
I understood the world. It was scary.
[Framme] 
That's why I put it down. I'm done. I quit.
[Diamant] 
Brodia...is a kingdom of warriors. It does have a 
regrettable history of seizing territory by force.
[Diamant] 
And it is true that some people in Elusia have 
been hurt by─and have grown to hate─Brodia.
[Diamant] 
That's an undeniable part of my kingdom's 
past, but I won't let it be part of our future.
[Diamant] 
It may not be easy, but I mean what I say. 
There will be change.
[Framme] 
In your own kingdom, you mean?
[Diamant] 
Yes. Please, believe me.
[Framme] 
I don't know... You skipped right over the bad 
parts of Brodia's history last time.
[Diamant] 
I didn't mean to hide any of that from you.
[Diamant] 
But...I suppose I have a guilty conscience about 
these things.
[Diamant] 
I understand why you'd be upset with me.
[Framme] 
No, no. I'm not upset. I just...
[Framme] 
Ugh, I don't know. I'm really letting this get 
to me, huh? History is so heavy...

[Framme] 
Hmm. Hmm...
[Diamant] 2 
[Diamant] 
I'm surprised to see you staring at that history 
book again, Framme.
[Diamant] 
I thought you quit.
[Framme] 
Well...
[Framme] 
I want to apologize, Prince Diamant.
[Framme] 
You plan on stopping your kingdom's wars, no 
matter how hard that might be. Right?
[Framme] 
I spent some time thinking about that and 
realized something important.
[Framme] 
I shouldn't let history scare me into quitting. 
In fact, that's a good reason to read more!
[Framme] 
Now I'm looking through this history book for 
ways to end conflict and warfare.
[Diamant] 
Framme... That's really great. Thank you.
[Framme] 
Well, I haven't found any good ideas yet.
[Diamant] 
That's OK. Even if you don't find any ideas, 
what matters is that you chose to act.
[Framme] 
Yeah. We can't change the past, but we can 
change the present and aim for a better future.
[Diamant] 
I certainly intend for my mark on history to 
be a bright one.
[Framme] 
Is that a promise?
[Diamant] 
It is. I promise, Framme.
[Framme] 
Good. Then I'm going to keep educating myself 
and do everything I can to help.
[Diamant] 
If that's the case, I'll help with your studies.
[Framme] 
You?! Help with my studies? No way.
[Framme] 
You're a crown prince. I know you're too busy 
to waste time on my "Vander homework."
[Diamant] 
Not at all. Plus, despite what you might assume, 
I've always been a pretty good student.
[Framme] 
With you, "pretty good" probably means "super, 
impossibly perfect."
[Diamant] 
Let's call it "good enough." I'm sure Vander will 
approve of a partner to keep you focused.
[Diamant] 
Shall we hit the books as a team and map out 
our path to peace?
[Framme] 
Oh, OK. You talked me into it. Thank you, 
Diamant. My future's looking brighter already!
[Framme] 
I'll become a wise steward...and name-drop 
the king of Brodia as my former study buddy!
