[Kagetsu] 
Prince Diamant! I must see your skill. 
Let us duel.
[Diamant] 
A duel? Sounds like fun.
[Diamant] 
I don't believe we've had a proper sparring 
match yet, have we?
[Kagetsu] 
Ah, you are easy to convince. Good!
[Diamant] 
You like to train, right? I have a pretty rigorous 
routine myself.
[Diamant] 
I just got done sprinting up and over three local 
mountains. A duel sounds like a nice cooldown.
[Kagetsu] 
Mountains? Three mountains?
[Diamant] 
All right, Kagetsu. Give me everything 
you've got!
[Kagetsu] 
...
[Kagetsu] 
I cannot.
[Diamant] 
What? Why?
[Kagetsu] 
Much as I long to challenge you, it would not do 
to face you in this state.
[Kagetsu] 
It would not be satisfying to win merely 
because you are tired.
[Diamant] 
So you won't challenge me unless I'm fresh out 
of bed? A win is a win, so let's duel!
[Kagetsu] 
No. I cannot allow it.
[Kagetsu] 
I have been raised to prize honor above victory. 
That is my homeland's way.
[Kagetsu] 
Win or lose, it is essential to uphold standards 
of dignity and fairness.
[Kagetsu] 
We must be like cherry blossoms, blooming 
only at appropriate times.
[Diamant] 
Ah, I see. That is an admirable philosophy. 
Let's consider our duel...postponed.
[Kagetsu] 
Thank you. I know it was I who extended this 
invitation. I appreciate your understanding.
[Diamant] 
I'll make sure I'm rested and at full strength 
next time. I won't hold anything back.
[Kagetsu] 
Excellent! I look forward to this fine contest.

[Kagetsu] 
We are well matched, Prince Diamant.
[Kagetsu] 
Your strength is beyond my expectations!
[Diamant] 
You're not so bad yourself, Kagetsu.
[Diamant] 
You'll have to keep giving this duel everything 
you've got. I certainly will.
[Diamant] 
So? Do you want to keep going?
[Kagetsu] 
I have fought with all my strength. I am content 
to leave it here and not push us to exhaustion.
[Diamant] 
Same here. You're quite an opponent!
[Kagetsu] 
I realize you put much of your valuable time 
toward this. Thank you.
[Diamant] 
It was fun. We'll have a rematch soon, right?
[Kagetsu] 
Would you like to?
[Diamant] 
We can't just let this end in a draw, can we?
[Diamant] 
I'll warn you...our next battle is going to end 
very differently.
[Diamant] 
I'll lay my honor as a crown prince on the line 
and fight until you're begging for mercy.
[Kagetsu] 
You speak boldly. But I swear by my blade 
that I shall have victory!
[Diamant] 
Your blade is rather impressive. I can tell you 
sharpen it often.
[Kagetsu] 
Our swords reflect our souls. I tend to mine 
each and every day.
[Kagetsu] 
Yours is majestic and powerful as well.
[Diamant] 
Ah, well... Brodian culture prioritizes strength, 
so I make sure my sword is a symbol of that.
[Diamant] 
And just like you, I consider it to be more than a 
simple weapon.
[Kagetsu] 
It is interesting. Our cultures are far apart, and 
yet this perception of weapons unites us.
[Diamant] 
It's amazing how well you get to know a person 
once you start crossing swords with them.
[Kagetsu] 
Knowledge beyond words. I look forward 
to our next contest.

[Diamant] 
Another draw. I can't believe it.
[Kagetsu] 
Nor I. You are much stronger than before. 
I was certain I would win this time.
[Diamant] 
Same here. You put in some real work after our 
last duel, didn't you?
[Kagetsu] 
A strong opponent provides much motivation 
to grow. Thank you, Prince Diamant.
[Diamant] 
Is that why you challenged me to begin with? 
To grow stronger?
[Kagetsu] 
That is part of my reason...but only part.
[Kagetsu] 
My true interest is in learning about the world.
[Diamant] 
How do you mean?
[Kagetsu] 
Custom, ideology, philosophy... There are many 
differences in other cultures I do not yet grasp.
[Kagetsu] 
But there are many similarities as wellâ”€such as 
our views with regard to swords.
[Kagetsu] 
I believe, as you do, that crossing swords can 
teach us more of one another than mere words.
[Kagetsu] 
That is why I wander in search of strong and 
interesting opponents.
[Diamant] 
Ahh, so that was your goal...
[Diamant] 
I'm a bit jealous, to be honest. My position often 
prevents me from traveling on my own terms.
[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps you could experience travel through 
me. I would be glad to share stories.
[Diamant] 
I'd like that. I do enjoy a good adventure story.
[Diamant] 
Uh... Pardon me.
[Kagetsu] 
Haha, no need to apologize. Our duel has 
worked you up to hunger!
[Kagetsu] 
Here, have some onigiri. It is made with rice. 
Delicious and refreshing.
[Diamant] 
Huh. Odd shape, but food is food.
[Diamant] 
It's...so sour!
[Kagetsu] 
There are plums inside, dried and salted. 
Does it not soothe your tired body?
[Diamant] 
It definitely has a kick out of the gate. Hm... 
I could get used to these.
[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps this could be another frontier for us 
to explore together, Prince Diamant.
[Diamant] 
Like a meal exchange? Sounds fun. Let's put 
down our swords and load up some plates.
