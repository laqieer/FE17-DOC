[Corrin] 
Is this... No, it's not. And yet, the similarities...
[Alear] 
What's the matter, Corrin?
[Corrin] 
This place looks very much like where my 
fate branched.
[Corrin] 
I had three options that day. My decision meant 
abandoning two of my possible fates.
[Alear] 
What do you mean?
[Corrin] 
In my world, there are two opposing kingdoms, 
Hoshido and Nohr...
[Corrin] 
I was born in Hoshido, but spent my childhood 
in Nohr.
[Alear] 
Having ties on both sides of a conflict... That 
would be a hard way to live your life.
[Corrin] 
Indeed. This is where Hoshido and Nohr faced 
off, and I had to choose which country to back.
[Corrin] 
I had family and friends in Hoshido and in Nohr. 
I didn't want to abandon any of them.
[Corrin] 
But as hard as it was, I had to make a decision.
[Corrin] 
Hoshido or Nohr? Maybe neither, and I would 
fight alone. There was no obvious answer.
[Alear] 
I don't know how I'd make such a big choice.
[Alear] 
It's possible a significant one still awaits me at 
some point on our journey...
[Corrin] 
You've already decided to face the Fell Dragon 
and save the world. I'd call that a big choice.
[Corrin] 
Now, let's see if your choice was a worthy one, 
. Face me in combat.
[Corrin] 
The results will inform my next choice... Surely, 
our bonds will grow stronger.
[Alear] 
I understand. The paths we've each chosen...
[Alear] 
I'm excited to find out what lies beyond the 
point where our fates meet.

[Corrin] 
I expected no less from you, . 
You gave my blade, Yato, quite a workout.
[Alear] 
What a beautiful sword.
[Corrin] 
It's a divine blade, forged to bring peace to 
the world.
[Corrin] 
When I first saw Yato, it flew from its hiding 
place into my hands. It chose me.
[Corrin] 
It was the same day my mother died 
protecting me...
[Alear] 
Oh, you...lost your mother too?
[Corrin] 
It would have been easy to lose myself in that 
pain. I couldn't have recovered alone.
[Corrin] 
Luckily, I had friends who stood by me and 
helped me find my way home.
[Corrin] 
And, like my friends, Yato was by my side at 
every step on my journey.
[Alear] 
I understand your feelings...quite well.
[Corrin] 
In the coming days, you'll make choices that 
might cause you no end of suffering.
[Corrin] 
But no matter what pain you're feeling, I'm with 
you, and I'll help you find your way home again.
[Alear] 
I will remember, even in the darkest moment, 
that I am not alone.
[Corrin] 
Then you'll be just fine.
[Alear] 
Thank you, Corrin, for joining me on this path 
I have chosen.

Corrin can alter the terrain. I can't get caught 
unaware by her changes.

[Corrin] 
I sense a draconic power underground. Is it... 
A Dragon Vein. I'll use that to my advantage.
[Corrin] 
[Corrin] 
Relax 
Don't worry, though. I'm sure you'll be able to 
handle it!

[Alear] 
This is where your destiny branched, isn't it? 
I think I can understand what you went through.

[Corrin] 
Do not swing timidly without resolve. You must 
genuinely try to kill me!

[Alear] 
As you say, Corrin. I've chosen my path, and 
I'll travel as far as it takes me!

You saved my life beforeâ”€I didn't expect us to 
end up fighting. The world is full of surprises...

[Corrin] Surprise 
[Corrin] 
The fortune-teller didn't foresee this event? 
My, how very strange.

[Seadall] 
Tease me all you like, but I think knowing the 
result of this fight would be boring.
[Corrin]

[Corrin] 
The future isn't set or planned. I control my 
own fate, as you do yours!
