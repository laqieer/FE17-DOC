[Alear] 
Where are we?
[Ike] 
Gebal Castle. At least, that's what it looks like.
[Alear] 
Someplace you've been?
[Ike] 
Yeah. It's near the border between the nations 
of Crimea and Gallia.
[Ike] 
Interesting that this place is where we will have 
our trial.
[Alear] 
Trial?
[Ike] 
We were pursued here by forces from the 
kingdom of Daein. They laid siege, trapping us.
[Ike] 
Our escape was cut off. The strength of their 
forces was overwhelming.
[Ike] 
My father had died, and I'd taken up his role 
as leader of the Greil Mercenaries.
[Ike] 
And this is where I met my first great trial.
[Alear] 
That sounds rough. What did you do?
[Ike] 
I foughtâ”€to protect my sister and the 
Greil Mercenaries.
[Ike] 
If you found yourself in the same situation, 
what would you do?
[Alear] 
I'd like to think I would also fight. I don't want 
anyone I care about to be harmed.
[Ike] 
And I believe you would fight well.
[Ike] 
So show me how you would defend those near 
to you. No words now, only deeds.
[Alear] 
A trial? You want me to fight you?
[Ike] 
If you win this fight, our bond will become 
even stronger.
[Alear] 
Understood! I won't lose.
[Ike] 
That's the spirit. Now, let's begin!

[Ike] 
Great work, ! You overcame the 
trial well.
[Alear] 
Thank you, Ike.
[Ike] 
You should know that, going forward, the 
fighting's going to get more intense.
[Ike] 
It's important to remember that you're a leader, 
and you must not give in to the pressure.
[Ike] 
In this war, there can be no retreat.
[Alear] 
You're right. If we run away, the world will be 
covered in darkness.
[Alear] 
But I worry that fighting this hard may be too 
much for everyone. Or...too much for me...
[Ike] 
There are people who need your help. Don't 
worry. You are more than capable.
[Ike] 
And when it seems your spirit might break, it's 
the bonds you've forged that will win the day.
[Alear] 
I'll hold your words in my heart.
[Ike] 
Don't worry. If it looks like you've forgotten it, 
I'll be there to remind you.
[Alear] 
You'll be by my side, always?
[Ike] 
Always.
[Alear] 
Thank you, Ike. I'm glad to know you're here 
with me.

I know the only way I'll beat you is to fight

I decided since I was fighting you, I should 
be extra serious.
[Ike]

[Ike] 
You have no intention of losing, then. I see.
[Fogado] 
Relax 

[Fogado] 
Never. If we're doing this, then I've got to win.
