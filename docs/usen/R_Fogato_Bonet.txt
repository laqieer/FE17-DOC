=== Fogado & Bunet ===
--- C ---




[Fogado]
Mm, yes! This grilled fish is divine. Mm! It has
such a supple mouthfeel.
[Bunet]
I added a pinch of salt to suck out the moisture.
That makes the fish nice and tender.
[Fogado]
Might be your finest work yet, Bunet, and that's
saying something.
[Bunet]
Well, after all, I'm not just your retainer but also
your personal chef.
[Bunet]
It is my duty to know what you like and prepare
your meals accordingly.
[Fogado]
I know! I'm a lucky man.
[Fogado]
But you forgot one thing.
[Bunet]
What?! Does it need more lemon? Is the
presentation not to your liking?
[Fogado]
Oh, not the dish─the titles. Retainer, personal
chef. You left one out.
[Fogado]
Best friend.
[Bunet]
Ah. Right you are, Fogado.
[Bunet]
We have a long history─sharing meals together
in my parents' bistro almost every day.
[Bunet]
More than the meals, it was the hours we spent
talking─well after patrons left─that I cherished.
[Fogado]
Yes. I'll always remember those days. Unlike
somebody, who forgot we were even friends...
[Bunet]
I didn't forget. For friends and flavors alike,
my memory is long and exacting.
[Bunet]
It's just that now I see you as more of a savior
than a friend.
[Fogado]
Psh, a savior? Me? How come?
[Bunet]
Heh... You don't understand. Of course.
[Bunet]
Never mind that. Just finish your meal before it
gets cold. Dessert will be ready shortly.
[Fogado]
Dessert? Oh, baby!
[Fogado]
This is the best food in the world, bar none.
I'll have a clean plate in no time.
[Bunet]
The best food in the world... Heh...

[Fogado]
Mm, delicious! Yet another culinary
triumph, Bunet.
[Bunet]
I could tell you were enjoying it because of that
scrumptious smile on your face.
[Fogado]
Oh, before I forget. We need to circle back and
talk about what you said the other day.
[Bunet]
What do you mean?
[Fogado]
You know, the "savior" thing. I've been racking
my brain, but I can't figure out what you meant.
[Bunet]
Oh. That.
[Bunet]
I entered that contest to become the royal
court's chef, and...I lost.
[Bunet]
It was the greatest shame of my life.
[Bunet]
Yet you found it in your heart to overlook my
failure and hire me as your personal chef.
[Bunet]
I could never pay you back for that kindness.
[Fogado]
Ah, I see. But, Bunet, I didn't really care about
the contest itself.
[Fogado]
I was just glad that you entered because it
brought you back into my life.
[Bunet]
What? Was that your plan all along?
[Fogado]
Of course. It had been years since the last time
we talked at your parents' bistro.
[Bunet]
That's true... What a bitter separation that was.
[Bunet]
But perhaps we should put this conversation on
the backburner. Your main course is ready.
[Bunet]
You wouldn't want a sour memory to detract
from the delightful flavor.
[Fogado]
You make a good point.
[Fogado]
Whoa! What a stunning dish! Your food really is
the best in the world.

[Fogado]
Mm! Well, that's dessert done with. What a
satisfying meal.
[Bunet]
Your delectable praise is a boon to my soul.
[Fogado]
Did I detect a note of bitterness? Setting the
stage for a hard conversation, I bet.
[Bunet]
Indeed. Something you said has been eating at
my mind. You...searched for me?
[Fogado]
Yeah. When I heard about the bandit raid on
your town, I was devastated.
[Fogado]
There was basically nothing left. Your parents'
cozy bistro...a pile of ashes.
[Bunet]
That image is burned in my memory.
[Fogado]
I felt so helpless. I had come as fast as I could,
but...it was too late.
[Fogado]
You'd fled along with everyone else. I had no
idea where you might have gone.
[Bunet]
I'm sorry... It all happened so suddenly, I didn't
have a chance to tell you.
[Fogado]
It wasn't your fault. At any rate...after you left,
I never stopped looking for you.
[Fogado]
I missed your delicious cooking, but more
than that, I missed our conversations.
[Bunet]
I missed them too.
[Fogado]
And then when I heard about the cooking
tournament, I knew you'd enter.
[Fogado]
There was no way you'd miss a chance to show
off to the whole queendom.
[Fogado]
If you think about it, your culinary skills are the
reason we were reunited.
[Bunet]
I did lose the contest, however.
[Fogado]
Heh heh─this again! Bunet, it's not a big deal.
You were out of practice.
[Fogado]
If there was another contest today, you'd win
hands down.
[Bunet]
Oh, Fogado... Thank you.
[Bunet]
I'm grateful you kept looking for me. That is
why we can enjoy delicious moments like this.
[Bunet]
You truly are my savior.
[Fogado]
"Savior" still feels a little...strong, but, eh,
I'll take it.
[Fogado]
And just so you know...I'm never letting you
leave me like that again.
[Bunet]
The feeling is entirely mutual.
[Bunet]
I am your personal chef and retainer.
[Bunet]
Most importantly, I am your best friend. And as
such, I swear to be true.
[Fogado]
I'm glad. Nothing is sweeter than your
friendship, Bunet.
