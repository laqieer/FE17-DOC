[Anna] 
Congratulations, big guy! Anniversaries like this 
don't come around every day.
[Anna] 
You should buy something to celebrate. It's a 
steal with my special anniversary discount!
[Mauvier] 
Hm? The anniversary of...what, exactly?
[Anna] 
Aw, don't play coy with me! I think you know 
just what I'm talking about.
[Mauvier] 
I do not. I have not the slightest idea.
[Anna] 
But how could you not know? It's your 
anniversary!
[Mauvier] 
That explains nothing.
[Anna] 
Think hard! I bet it's on the tip of your tongue. 
C'mon, you're getting close.
[Mauvier] 
I have no idea what you are talking about.
[Anna] 
No? Too bad. Guess you won't be getting my 
special anniversary price on this fruit after all.
[Mauvier] 
Suppose it is the anniversary of an important 
event in my life. How would you know?
[Anna] 
Psh! No need to get hung up on details like that.
[Mauvier] 
The odds are in your favor that any given day is 
special for someone you're trying to sell to.
[Anna] 
Aw, tipped my hand there, did I? Oh well.
[Anna] 
Let's just call this the anniversary of the time 
we talked, and I'll sell you the fruit.
[Anna] 
How does half-price sound? Are you really 
gonna haggle with a poor little girl?!
[Mauvier] 
You are a bold salesperson of dubious morals. 
Still, I admit I am impressed. I shall buy the fruit.
[Anna] 
Yes! Chalk up another sale for me. Thanks for 
your business!

[Mauvier] 
Anna, the fruit I purchased from you was tasty.
[Anna] 
Hmph. It's Lady Anna, not Anna. Address me 
properly or take a hike!
[Mauvier] 
Lady Anna. I would like to buy another piece of 
fruit, if I may?
[Anna] 
You sure may! But give me a minute while I say 
my prayers first.
[Mauvier] 
Prayers? I did not know you to be religious.
[Anna] 
Oh, no. I'm not the least bit religious, but I do 
pray sometimes.
[Mauvier] 
I do not understand.
[Anna] 
Hmm...how do I explain this? Well, I'm about to 
pray right now, so just watch me.
[Mauvier] 
Fine then. Please go ahead.
[Anna] 
Ahem...
[Anna] 
Please... All I want is for my products to sell 
well again today.
[Anna] 
For my customers to be satisfied...even happy, 
at least for a little while.
[Anna] 
I ask that they remember me the next time they 
need something.
[Anna] 
That should do it! So yeah, that's the kind of 
thing I always pray for.
[Mauvier] 
Huh...
[Anna] 
What's up?
[Mauvier] 
I admit that I had written you off as a small-time 
scam artist...
[Mauvier] 
I never imagined you prayed with such passion.
[Mauvier] 
And...I am embarrassed to admit that I looked 
down on you, Lady Anna. I must apologize.
[Anna] 
Aw, no need for all that. C'mon, let's see about 
that fruit, huh?

[Anna] 
There you are, Mauvier! You gonna buy 
something from me today or what?
[Mauvier] 
...
[Anna] 
What's the matter?
[Mauvier] 
I was praying.
[Anna] 
Praying? To who?
[Mauvier] 
I do not know. No one? I was just sending out 
a prayer.
[Mauvier] 
I was intrigued by your own prayer the other 
day and wished to try the practice for myself.
[Anna] 
No kidding?
[Mauvier] 
I never imagined I would feel this way 
when praying.
[Anna] 
You don't pray much, huh?
[Mauvier] 
I was a follower of the Fell Dragon.
[Mauvier] 
I would pray every day...and feel nothing.
[Anna] 
Oh. So you did pray, but it was just going 
through the motions.
[Mauvier] 
Yes, exactly. My parents were devout believers 
in the Divine Dragon.
[Mauvier] 
But our family was destroyed by an epidemic. 
Praying did no good.
[Mauvier] 
So even though I prayed, I never understood 
what it was I truly believed.
[Mauvier] 
You showed me praying is not only for worship. 
It can be a means to think warmly of others.
[Anna] 
Yeah, that's how I see it too. I'm glad someone 
else gets it!
[Mauvier] 
Thank you for teaching me this feeling.
[Anna] 
Oh, quit being so stiff. Hey, what did you pray 
for anyway?
[Mauvier] 
There is someone I would give my life to 
protect. I was praying for them.
[Anna] 
Wow... That's real sweet of you. I wonder if 
anyone will ever pray like that for me.
[Mauvier] 
I prayed for you as well, Lady Anna.
[Anna] 
What? Really?!
[Mauvier] 
I prayed you would be always healthy and able 
to sell your wares with a smile.
[Anna] 
Hahaha, nice!
[Anna] 
I've got just the thing to thank you with! You 
really liked that fruit, right?
[Mauvier] 
Yes... But do I not owe you some payment?
[Anna] 
Nah. It's free today, on account of it being the 
anniversary of me being so touched.
[Anna] 
Take the gesture and get outta here, 
you cheapskate!
[Mauvier] 
Well, thank you.
[Mauvier] 
Since it is a special day, we should share 
this fruit.
[Anna] 
Yes! These are pretty expensive, so I don't get 
many excuses to eat them myself.
[Mauvier] 
I suspected that might be the case. Let us eat, 
and perhaps discuss other prayers as well.
