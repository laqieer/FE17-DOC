You have nowhere to run, .
" [Veyle] Normal 
And no rings to protect you! At last, I can 
unleash the full force of my hatred.
You and all your allies will be killed...
[Veyle] Shy 
by your beloved friends...the Emblems.

We have to fight! We have to rescue Marth and 
the others!

[Alfred] 
No, Divine One. Veyle has the Time Crystal and 
the rings. We're not going to win this one.
[Alfred] Pain 
I don't have to tell you how powerful the 
Emblems are.
[Alfred] 
Angry 
But we can at least survive this thing.

If we make it over there, we might be able to 
shake off Veyle.

[Ivy] 
This way. We can travel to Solm through 
this forest.
I hate to abandon Hortensia, but staying in the 
kingdom is not an option.
[Alcryst] 3 

[Alcryst] 
There's too much we're leaving behind.

[Diamant] 
Father...
[Diamant] 
[Alfred] 3 
[Alfred] 
It's painful, but we can't turn back. We'd 
lose everything.
[Ivy] 
I will lead the way.
[Alear] 
...
I failed you, Marth. I failed you all.

[Veyle] 白 悪 2

So, Ivy was scheming against us.
She stole two Emblems from right under 
my nose...
How irksome. Regardless, the advantage is 
mine. I have all of the rings they gathered.
You shall all be destroyed. I will gut your allies, 
burn down your countries...
and crush your spirits.

[Ivy] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Ivy] 
We should be safe now.
[Alear] 
Veyle is Sombron's daughter.
And now she has our Emblem Rings.
I'm sorry, everyone. I should never have brought 
us to the cathedral.
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
It's not your fault, Divine One.
[Ivy] 
[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
I should apologize. I asked you to let me fight. 
I was so angry about what they'd done...
[Alcryst] 3 

[Alcryst] 
What about me? I'm the one who wanted to 
return Father to Brodia.
[Alfred] 
[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
That was illogical.
[Alcryst] 
Excuse me? If you hadn't gotten in the way...
[Alear] 
Calm down, everyone. We're on the same side.
[Alcryst] 
No, we're not! If not for her, we might have 
made it in time!
We might have saved him!
[Alear] 
Alcryst...
[Diamant] 
Princess Ivy told us about the ritual in the 
first place.
Without her help, Father would still be one of 
those creatures.
[Alcryst] 
Diamant, she helped kill our father! Why are you 
making excuses for her?
[Diamant] 
Princess Ivy's not to blame─her father was. 
And the Fell Dragon murdered him.
There wasn't even a body left behind.
[Alcryst] 
...
[Alear] 
Arguing won't get us anywhere.
[Diamant] 
Apologies, Divine One.
Princess Ivy, I hope you'll forgive my brother. 
He spoke out of turn.
[Ivy] 
No, it's all right. I am sorry that I couldn't stop 
the ritual.
[Alcryst] 
I just... I can't bear the thought that I'll never 
see him again.
And the ring he spent his whole life 
protecting? Gone.
[Diamant] 
...
[Ivy] 
[Diamant] 
[Alear] 1 

[Alear] 
We have suffered loss after loss.
But the Emblems aren't dead. We can still get 
them back.
And we will. I know we will.
[Alcryst] 
Divine One...
[Alcryst] 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
You still have Emblems on your side.
[Lucina] 4 
[Lucina] 
That's right. Don't forget about us.
[Alear] 
Lyn. Lucina.
[Lyn] 
All is far from lost. We can offer our unique 
strengths as Emblems.
[Lucina] 
You can still challenge your fate. You don't lose 
by retreating.
[Alear] 
I wish it didn't come to this.
My mother told me that a Divine Dragon 
should never run away.
[Lyn] 
We're not running away. As Lucina said, we're 
retreating. There's a difference.
[Alear] 
Hm.
[Lyn] 
Time and again, you've shown true bravery, 
even in the face of daunting odds.
But refusing to move on... That's not bravery. 
It's folly.
[Lucina] 
There's courage. And there's stubbornness. 
Lumera would have taught you the difference.
Unfortunately, in your short time together, 
she didn't have the chance.
[Alear] 
Perhaps that's why Marth said what he did 
outside the cathedral.
[Lucina] 
Probably so.
[Alear] 
Now, at least, I understand.
We're not running away─we're stepping back. 
Gathering our strength for the next battle.
I'll become a better fighter─a better leader.
I'll make sure no one─not one more person─ 
loses their life under my command.
And I'll bring back our friends the Emblems.
What do you say, everyone? Are you with me?
[Lyn] 
[Lucina] 
[Alfred] 2 
[Alfred] 
You know I am. Let's turn the tables on them.
[Alfred]
[Diamant] 2 
[Diamant] 
I won't rest until we reclaim what we've lost.
[Diamant] 

[Alcryst] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Even now, you have hope. I will stand with 
you, too, Divine One.
[Alfred] 
[Ivy] 2 

[Ivy] 
I will help too. If you'll have me.
[Alear] 
Thank you, everyone.
Now, to the queendom of Solm. Stay with me 
and I promise to keep you safe.

It is I, Lucina.

[Alear] 
Lucina!
[Lucina] Serious 
[Lucina] 
I may not be the Hero-King, and I cannot 
replace him.
But I can aid you. I strive to be a light in the 
dark─a light for all who have fallen to despair.
[Lucina] StandBy 
For now, we may only escape. But as long as 
we survive, hope will abide.

Now, engage with me.

Yes. Here they are. The Ring of the Lady of the 
Plains and the Ring of the Princess Exalt.

Are you sure about this? Turning against your 
own country?
[Ivy] 
Right now, turning against Elusia is the only 
way to save it.
For my kingdom, for my father, this is the only 
course of action.
I know this isn't enough to atone for all I've 
done, but...will you let me join your side?
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
Of course I will. Thank you.
The Ring of the Lady of the Plains belongs 
with you, since it was entrusted to Elusia.
