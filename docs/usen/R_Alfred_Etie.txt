[Alfred]
Amazing...weather we're having today, huh?
[Etie]
Too true. It's the perfect day for a cup of tea.
[Alfred]
Especially the tea you prepare, Etie. It's my
favorite of all.
[Etie]
That's...kind of you to say. Would you like
another cup?
[Alfred]
N-no. I'd better not...
[Etie]
If... If you say so... Ngh...
[Alfred]
Aaagh! I can't...hold it...anymore... I'm out.
[Etie]
Your cup is down first. I win.
[Alfred]
Yep. Fair play, Etie. I got no excuse.
[Alfred]
Although I could swear our special workout
teacups seem heavier today.
[Etie]
Well spotted. I did add some weight, in fact.
[Alfred]
No wonder I had such trouble just lifting it.
[Etie]
Don't whine. The road to muscle gain is long
and bumpy, and you've just begun.
[Etie]
Teatime will only get harder from here.
[Alfred]
I expect nothing less. Let's raise our teacups
to strength!
[Etie]
To strength!

[Alfred]
Hmm... You're sure about this?
[Etie]
Extremely.
[Etie]
You're not leaving until you've drank every drop
of my new and improved muscle stimulant.
[Alfred]
Well, anything for strength!
[Etie]
That's the spirit.
[Etie]
I put a lot of research into this one. I guarantee
you'll see results.
[Alfred]
That's great news! Thanks for putting so much
effort into this.
[Alfred]
It's just... You couldn't have done anything
about the smell?
[Etie]
Sorry. You'll have to hold your nose.
[Etie]
It was unavoidable with all the different
ingredients I used.
[Alfred]
Like what exactly?
[Etie]
In researching this drink, I interviewed a lot
of hardbodies.
[Etie]
I found out their favorite foods so that I could
mix them all into one potent stew.
[Alfred]
All of them? At once?
[Etie]
Well, all of those plus a few other things I
thought might help.
[Alfred]
And...how does it taste?
[Etie]
Couldn't tell you. I haven't tried it.
[Alfred]
Unbelievable.
[Alfred]
You waited until I could try it first before having
any for yourself? I'm touched, Etie!
[Etie]
It's all part of the job.
[Alfred]
Aw, I'm ashamed to have been so nitpicky over
little things like taste and smell.
[Alfred]
I want you to know how grateful I am, Etie.
[Alfred]
Bottoms up! To strength!
[Etie]
To strength!
[Alfred]
...
[Alfred]
Ahhhh.
[Etie]
Well? What did you think?
[Alfred]
One thing's for sure...
[Alfred]
It's not fit for human consumption.
[Etie]
I was afraid of that.

[Alfred]
Good morning, Etie! Any suggestions for our
early workout?
[Etie]
How about a run?
[Alfred]
Sounds good. Wanna make it a race?
[Etie]
Nah. I'd prefer to run alongside. Easier to keep
you safe that way.
[Alfred]
Makes sense. Oh, look.
[Etie]
Is something wrong?
[Alfred]
No, I just noticed how beautiful those flowers
are. Let's put the run on hold for a minute.
[Etie]
As you wish.
[Alfred]
You know what pretty flowers always remind
me of?
[Alfred]
This memory I have of you with an armload
of them.
[Etie]
My hometown is known for those flowers.
I used to bring some anytime I visited the castle.
[Alfred]
I remember. My mother and the servants
loved them.
[Etie]
Good. I'm glad.
[Alfred]
Speaking of Mother, you wanna hear
something funny?
[Alfred]
She originally thought you might be the one to
become my queen.
[Etie]
You're kidding. That's the first I've heard of it.
[Etie]
But that does explain some things.
[Etie]
Now I get why I was assigned to you instead of
Princess Céline, my childhood friend.
[Etie]
I've wondered about that for years. Mystery
solved, I guess.
[Alfred]
That must have bugged you.
[Etie]
Don't be ridiculous. I'm proud to be your
retainer, Prince Alfred.
[Etie]
Though it's a bit of a shock to try to imagine
myself as your queen.
[Etie]
Queen Etie...
[Alfred]
Hmm...
[Etie]
Hehe!
[Alfred]
Hahaha!
[Etie]
Apologies to Queen Ève, but I can't picture it
no matter how hard I try.
[Alfred]
Me neither. I try to imagine us as anything but
what we are now and my brain freezes up.
[Etie]
I know what you mean.
[Etie]
Our bond as prince and retainer is too strong
to be anything else.
[Alfred]
Workout partners too. Don't forget that.
[Etie]
Heh. Always, Prince Alfred.
[Etie]
Speaking of which, shouldn't we get going on
that run? I'm getting antsy.
[Alfred]
Lead the way, Etie. Every day spent training
with you is a gift.
[Alfred]
To strength! And to peace.
[Etie]
And to your happiness.
