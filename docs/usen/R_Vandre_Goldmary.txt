[Goldmary]
AHH!
[Vander]
Goldmary! What has happened?! Are you
all right?
[Goldmary]
My poor clothes... I must have torn my sleeve
on that tree back there.
[Vander]
You...tore your sleeve.
[Vander]
From the sound of it, I thought you were under
attack. I came rushing for nothing.
[Goldmary]
I'm so sorry to alarm you.
[Goldmary]
My piercing cry must have struck your ears like
the ringing of gilded trumpets.
[Goldmary]
But at least now you're here to help me through
this ordeal. What should I do?
[Vander]
What a sad state you are in.
[Vander]
All right. Show me the sleeve.
[Goldmary]
What for?
[Vander]
So I can see the tear. Do you want my help
or not?
[Goldmary]
I'll have to get my sewing kit.
[Vander]
I will use mine. This should take but a moment.
[Goldmary]
Oh, you have your own?
[Vander]
Is that so strange?
[Goldmary]
No, not at all. I'm very impressed, actually.
[Vander]
Come on, then. Show me the tear. I do have
other tasks to complete today.
[Goldmary]
Thank you so much.
[Vander]
Remember though, this is only a mend and not
a repair.

[Goldmary]
Hello, Vander.
[Vander]
Whatever you need, I am sure it can wait until
I've finished my knitting.
[Goldmary]
I just wanted to thank you again for fixing my
sleeve the other day.
[Vander]
I happened to be passing by. Anyone else in my
position would have done the same.
[Goldmary]
Mmm, but you were the one who stopped to
help me, so it's you who gets my thanks.
[Goldmary]
May I ask what it is you're working on?
[Vander]
Lace. I do not know what will become of it yet.
I will sort that out when it's done.
[Goldmary]
I'm sure you could make all kinds of accessories
that would accentuate my natural charisma.
[Vander]
An accessory. Good idea.
[Goldmary]
I admire you, Vander. You're strong, but you
also have a delicate touch. I think that's lovely.
[Vander]
I was attendant to Queen Lumera for a
long time.
[Vander]
The job required me to be proficient in sewing,
cooking, cleaning...all manner of housework.
[Goldmary]
I consider housework to be among my greatest
skills, but you may actually have me beat.
[Goldmary]
With all your talents, I imagine you were quite
the charmer in your youth.
[Vander]
Not particularly.
[Vander]
I was far too devoted to my vocation to have
time for that sort of thing.
[Goldmary]
I see...
[Vander]
...
[Vander]
If I give this to you, will you go on your way?
[Goldmary]
You're offering me the lace?
[Goldmary]
Thank you, but I wouldn't want to deprive the
person it's intended for.
[Vander]
It is not intended for anyone. I only knit to
occupy my hands while my mind does its work.

[Goldmary]
Have a look at this, Vander.
[Vander]
I see you have made good use of my lace.
That is a fine accessory.
[Goldmary]
I'm sorry if your craftsmanship is overshadowed
by my grace in wearing it.
[Vander]
You have no shortage of self-esteem,
I must say.
[Goldmary]
I'll take that as a compliment.
[Vander]
I suppose you should. Confidence is a good
trait. You have the right attitude.
[Goldmary]
Thank you very much.
[Goldmary]
If it's not too much trouble, Vander...
[Goldmary]
Could I ask something of you?
[Vander]
What is it?
[Goldmary]
You said knitting is a way to occupy your hands
while your mind does its work.
[Goldmary]
I wonder if you'd like to...put some of that work
toward me?
[Vander]
How do you mean?
[Goldmary]
I'm asking you to teach me how to knit.
[Goldmary]
I think it would make a wonderful addition
to my ever-broadening array of talents.
[Vander]
Grant me the patience... I have no idea how
I ever perceived you as humble.
[Goldmary]
Am I asking for too much? I'm sorry...
[Vander]
I shall teach you what I know. I am interested
to see what you can do.
[Goldmary]
Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it.
[Goldmary]
In return, of course, you'll have the pleasure
of my scintillating conversation.
[Goldmary]
Before long you'll be wondering how you ever
managed to do all that knitting alone.
[Vander]
Haha, you really are something else.
[Vander]
Your confidence comes paired with a brazen
tongue. You simply say whatever you think.
[Vander]
Yet it is a trait that does make conversation
with you enjoyable, I must admit.
[Vander]
Very well. It is always nice to talk. Perhaps we
will have a good bit of fun.
[Goldmary]
I'm confident we will.
