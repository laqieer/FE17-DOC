[Saphir] 
HYAAA!
[Saphir] 
All right─that's 10 of you. Who's next?
[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
Very impressive, Saphir.
[Saphir] 
Prince Diamant! Didn't realize you 
were watching.
[Diamant] 
Checking in on our soldiers is part of my job.
[Saphir] 
Don't worry about me─I'm in prime condition, 
built for battle. Ready anytime.
[Diamant] 
I've seen enough to know that's not talk. I'm 
sure you can handle just about anything.
[Diamant] 
Like, say...a sudden sparring match. Got time 
for a quick round?
[Saphir] 
Sir, I...couldn't possibly.
[Diamant] 
Oh, sure you could. Don't tell me you're not 
up for it...
[Saphir] 
I have a long way to go before I'll feel ready 
to take you on.
[Saphir] 
When I'm truly satisfied...it'd be a privilege 
to spar with you.
[Diamant] 
I see. And when do you think that will be?
[Saphir] 
When I finally get past my hatred.
[Diamant] 
What do you mean?
[Saphir] 
The war with Elusia's been too bloody.
[Saphir] 
I haven't been able to wipe away the stain on 
my memory.
[Saphir] 
I want to put it behind me, but...I need to be 
stronger than I am right now to do it.
[Diamant] 
I see. Sorry, Saphir. I didn't mean to dredge up 
painful memories like that.
[Saphir] 
Not at all. I'm honored by your invitation and 
sorry to decline it.

[Diamant] 
Saphir! Any chance I can talk you into that 
sparring match today?
[Saphir] 
My stance hasn't changed, Prince Diamant. 
I don't feel ready.
[Diamant] 
Even if you don't think you're ready, I'd still 
like to test your current skills.
[Saphir] 
If you insist... It'd be rude to turn you away.
[Saphir] 
But if I win, will you hear me out on something?
[Diamant] 
If you'd rather just chat, we don't need to spar.
[Saphir] 
I don't want to discuss this unless I win. 
Wouldn't feel right.
[Diamant] 
Interesting. It's a deal, then.

[Diamant] 
You actually beat me...
[Diamant] 
I knew you were strong, but...I clearly 
underestimated you.
[Saphir] 
...
[Diamant] 
All right. A deal is a deal. What did you want to 
talk about?
[Saphir] 
Right... OK.
[Saphir] 
When I was a child...Elusia attacked and 
destroyed my home village.
[Diamant] 
...
[Saphir] 
I survived basically by luck. My parents, my 
friends...they were all killed.
[Saphir] 
There was nothing I could do. I was powerless.
[Saphir] 
That feeling haunts me to this day. It makes me 
want to scream and tear my heart out.
[Diamant] 
I've felt a similar kind of pain myself.
[Saphir] 
That pain is why I train the way I do. Only 
strength can free me from it.
[Diamant] 
It's royals like me who declare wars...but the 
citizens and soldiers are the ones who suffer.
[Diamant] 
Your training may keep innocent Brodians safe 
someday. That's the greater meaning behind it.
[Saphir] 
Thank you, Prince Diamant. It does feel good to 
get that off my chest.
[Saphir] 
I'm going to overcome this weakness, no matter 
what it takes.

[Saphir] 
Prince Diamant. Did you need something 
from me?
[Diamant] 
I noticed some hesitation in your last few 
training sessions.
[Saphir] 
...
[Saphir] 
I know more strength is what I need, but at the 
same time...I'm starting to scare myself.
[Saphir] 
I'm worried about becoming someone who 
only exists to hurt people.
[Diamant] 
...
[Diamant] 
Wars leave scars that last forever. They hurt 
everyone involved, on all sides of any conflict.
[Diamant] 
I often feel lost, just like you...but I always come 
back to two things. One─I can't run away.
[Diamant] 
Two─I don't fight to win. I fight to end the 
fighting. As soldiers, that's all we can do.
[Saphir] 
I don't know if I have that in me.
[Diamant] 
I'm so sorry...but we have to. That's the only 
way to change a world driven by conflict.
[Saphir] 
I'll...do my best.
[Saphir] 
With your help, Prince Diamant...maybe I can 
find a way to do as you ask.
[Diamant] 
That's precisely why we train together─to grow 
stronger in our bodies and our bonds.
[Diamant] 
After all this talk of fighting...do you feel up to 
another sparring match?
[Saphir] 
That's all we can do, isn't it?
[Diamant] 
That's exactly right.
[Saphir] 
OK, but no holding back this time.
[Diamant] 
You think I was holding back? I never hold back!
[Saphir] 
Whatever you say. In that case, though, you 
better dig deep.
[Diamant] 
Haha, now I'm fired up. Bring it on, soldier!
