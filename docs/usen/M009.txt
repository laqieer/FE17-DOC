[Alear] 
Diamant, where's the king?
[Diamant] 
He's headed to the front line. Our orders are to 
wait here with the rear guard.
[Alear] 
Will do.
[Diamant] 
Here. Take this.
[Alear] 
The ring? You didn't give it to your father?
[Diamant] 
I tried. He wouldn't take it.
[Roy] 3 
[Roy] 
The king said that if anything should happen, 
he wants you to keep my ring safe.
[Alear] 
But what if he needs it?
[Diamant] 
Father wants a fair fight.
Not to say that using the ring is unfair. But we 
Brodians have a particular sense of pride.
He wants to stand in his own strength and 
asked us to respect that.
[Alear] 
I understand. I'm just not sure our enemies will 
have the same code of honor.
Let's be at the ready. If push comes to shove, 
I want to be able to help.
[Diamant] 
It's a plan.
[Roy] 
Agreed.
[Alear] 
It looks like the battle has begun.

Come on, Diamant. There's still time to rescue him!

My father! They're trying to take him away!

We won't let them!
[Ivy] 1 

[Ivy] 
So you say... But you are wrong.
[Alear] 
Princess Ivy!
[Hyacinth] 3 
[Hyacinth] 
Whatever the cost, you will hold them here, child.
[Ivy] 
Yes.
[Hyacinth] 
Oh, and, Ivy? Don't forget that ring was given 
to you by our Lord Sombron.
Your failure to protect it was a grievous one.
[Ivy] 
...
[Hyacinth] 
It is your duty to reclaim the ring now. I take my 
leave to Elusia. Do not fail me again.
[Hyacinth] 

[Ivy] 
So...you want me to buy time for you as I die here.
[Hyacinth] 

[Ivy] 
Very well. I die for you, Father...
[Diamant] 
You're not going to stop us.
[Alear] 
We have to get King Morion back from them 
right now. We have to!

Dragging away Father like that... What could 
King Hyacinth be planning?
[Alear] Pain 

[Alear] 
I don't know. But with so many of the 
Corrupted...this will be a tough battle.

Couldn't be a worse time for meditation, but 
I've gotta clear my head.

[Ivy] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Ivy] 
You've won... Please, kill me.
[Alear] 
No. I will not take your life.
[Ivy] 
Don't be naive. If I live, what's to stop me from 
hunting you down?
[Alear] 
You can't return to Elusia after this. Your 
kingdom's through with you.
[Ivy] 
What gives you that idea?
[Alear] 
If King Hyacinth had wanted you to survive, 
he would have given you an Emblem Ring.
Besides, he had no need to stall us. The weather 
alone would have slowed us down.
I don't understand it, but...the king used you. 
He never meant for you to survive.
[Ivy] 
I suppose you're right.
[Alear] 
Your father has already sacrificed your life.
I won't do the same.
[Ivy] 
You will not grant me the release of death. 
How cruel.
But...you are my deity, and I respect your will.
[Alear] 
Huh?
[Ivy] 
Could I ask you to forget that?
[Alear] 
All right...
[Ivy] 
In exchange, I offer information.
I will tell you where King Morion is being taken, 
and why.
[Alear] 
...
[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
Well? Out with it!
[Ivy] 
My father intends to perform a ritual that will 
restore the Fell Dragon's power.
[Alear] 
A ritual?
[Ivy] 
You see, though the Fell Dragon has been freed, 
his abilities are diminished.
Imprisonment drained him. He is exhausted and 
can't transform into a dragon.
Ideally he would have all 12 rings, but securing 
them will take time.
In the interim, Sombron decided to temporarily 
regain his powers through an ancient ritual...
in which he consumes sovereign blood.
[Diamant] 
You can't mean my father!
[Alear] 
But then King Morion...
[Ivy] 
Yes. My father took him as an offering to 
Sombron. That was his aim from the start.
[Alear] 
That's horrific.
[Ivy] 
The ritual will take place at Destinea Cathedral. 
You must hurry.
And do be careful. Since the Fell Dragon's 
return, Father has not been himself.
[Alear] 
I see...
[Ivy] 
That is the extent of what I know. Come, 
Zelkov, Kagetsu. Let us leave this place.
[Alear] 
What are you going to do?
[Ivy] 
Whatever I can. Without taking sides.
If we meet again, Divine Dragon... I pray it is not 
as enemies.
[Ivy] 

[Alear] 
Let's head to Elusia.
[Diamant] 
Yes, we have to hurry!

[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
The deeper we venture into Elusia, the worse 
this blizzard gets.
Is this the way to Destinea Cathedral?
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
I don't know. In this snow, it's hard to tell 
where we're going.
[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
Gah... We don't have time to get lost!
Hold on. I see someone up ahead.
[Veyle] [Bandages] 1 
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
Hm? Is that you, ?
[Alear] 
Veyle!
[Diamant] 
You know her?
[Alear] 
She's a friend. Veyle, how did you get here?
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
I... I don't know.
[Alear] 
You don't know how you crossed the border 
into another country?
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
Well, how about you? You look worried. 
Is something the matter?
[Alear] 
We're trying to reach Destinea Cathedral, 
but we got lost in the snow.
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
If it's the cathedral you're looking for, head 
that way.
[Alear] 
You know where it is?
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
Uh-huh. You're close. See the really tall tree 
over there? Use that as a landmark.
[Alear] 
I appreciate your help.
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
I owed you for patching me up the other day. 
That was so kind...
Huh. Were you wearing that ring 
before, ?
[Alear] 
Yes. It's very important to me.
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
I didn't notice it the other day. It's pretty.
Really...pretty...
[Alear] 
Veyle?
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
Em...blem...Ring...
[Alear] 
Veyle!
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
...
Oh! I'm sorry! I'd better be on my way!
[Veyle] [Bandages] 

[Alear] 
Where are you going? It's not safe!
[Alfred] 
She's gone.
[Diamant] 
There's no time to search for her. Not when 
Father's life hangs in the balance.
[Alear] 
You're right. Let's hurry.
Veyle... What in the world?

HYAAAH!

Your invasions of my country come at 
a very high price.
[Hyacinth] 
And now you will pay it!
[Morion] 
Hahaha! Do you really think you can withstand 
the might of Brodia?
[Hyacinth] 
Yes. My army is blessed by Lord Sombron himself.
[Morion] 
Damn you!
[Morion] 
Heh...
[Morion] 
Well then! Is that all the power your dragon's got?
[Hyacinth] 
He is not yet at full strength.
[Hyacinth] 
Not until the ritual...
[Morion] 
Ritual?
[Hyacinth] 
The one by which we shall reignite his true glory.
[Hyacinth] 
And for that...we need a sacrifice of 
sovereign blood.
[Hyacinth] 
The blood thus offered...
[Hyacinth] 
will be yours!
[Morion] 
What?
[Morion] 
AAH!
