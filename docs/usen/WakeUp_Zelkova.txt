It is time to *wake,* Divine One.


Still *asleep*?
How troublesome. I have much to do today.
Time for a *harsher* method.
An unpleasant *noise* close by the ear should 
do nicely.


Good morning.
Do my *methods* displease you?
I was told to wake you by *any* means.
Clearly I've succeeded.


I am *pleased* to see that you wake so easily.
My work here is done. Farewell.


--- C2 ---

What a *curious* place.
Still as the grave.


You are *alive.*
Therefore you must wake eventually.
I am patient enough to wait...
*if* I'm not bored.


Sooner than I *expected.*
I brought a book...
to *entertain* me while waiting.
Ah, well.


Good.
I could not *hear* you breathing.
I am pleased my *concern* was unnecessary.


--- B1 ---

You always sleep so *soundly.*


You slept for a *millennium.*
I can hardly fathom it.
I wonder what it was like.
Did you have dreams? *Nightmares*?


Awake, I see.
Please pay my *presence* no mind.
Your slumber merely intrigues me.
I only *nap,* myself.


And you wake with such *grace.*
I *confess,* Divine One...
I'm envious.


--- B2 ---

This room is terribly *empty.*
Without *clutter,* I feel lost.


I have a *confession.*
Ever since your visit...
my secret sanctum has *accumulated* a large 
number of objects.
I don't know what to do.


You are awake.
I will return to my *collections.*
If you'd like...
pay me another *visit.*


Good morning.
Is it possible...
that you grow weary out of *boredom* in this 
empty room?


--- A1 ---

Your slumber is *deep* today.
I am quite loath to disturb it.


Today, I am *prepared* to kill time.
I have brought the *ingredients* needed...
to make medicine.
Now then, let us begin. First to *chop* 
these herbs, and then...


Behold my creation.
I call it the *violet wonder.*
Have a taste.
It will *invigorate* you.


It seems I was *incorrect.*
You woke rather quickly.
Good morning.


--- A2 ---

I have arrived early and am *prepared* to work.


Divine One...
I am concerned you have adopted my *manner* 
of speaking.
You would not do it in this sacred place, surely?


Ah! You awake in such silence...and with such 
a mysterious look...
Do your *glances*...
now suggest deeper meaning?


You rose quickly.
Is there a deeper *meaning* to that?
You are an endlessly *entertaining* mystery.


--- S1 ---

I have *arrived,* Divine One. Is it all right if 
I come in?


Now, how shall I *entertain* myself while I wait 
for you to wake?
I could read or make medicine...
but oddly enough, I do not feel the need.
Being near you has become *meaningful* to me 
in its own right.
With you, I am never bored.
You have given me purpose. A reason to go on 
living. Thank you.


You are awake.
Let us prepare for *battle*...
so we may make the world a peaceful place.
The more time we kill together, the more I look 
forward to having free time to kill.


Up already?
No need to *hurry* for my sake.
The entire purpose of our partnership...
is to kill time, if you recall.


--- S2 ---

*Empty* as the room may look...
there is a place set aside for my necklace here.
I am sure of it.


As deep in *slumber* as ever.
I hope you are still breathing.
The *affection* I feel for you...
is the same as I feel for my family.
In that way, you have given me a sense of 
*renewed* purpose.
If I were to lose that...
I do not know what I would do.
Let me protect you.


The moment you awake is a *happy* one 
for me.
My dear friend...
I look forward to spending a great many more 
of our days together.


Good morning.
You seem to have mastered the 
*mysterious* way.
Once you become accustomed to it...
you cannot easily turn back.
