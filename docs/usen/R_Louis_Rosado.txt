=== Louis & Rosado ===
--- C ---



[Rosado]
What's the matter, Louis? Can't take your eyes
off me?
[Louis]
Indeed, Rosado. I find you positively enchanting.
[Rosado]
Wait, really?
[Louis]
In every movement and speech, you are a
fountain of energy.
[Louis]
To my eye, it is sublime.
[Rosado]
Hahaha! I was teasing, but I love your honesty!
[Rosado]
I thought you were mainly interested in seeing
people socialize, though.
[Rosado]
Is it the same thing to watch me without
anyone else around?
[Louis]
It's not so different.
[Louis]
Some people display boundless reserves of
energy even when alone.
[Louis]
When you spot a puppy gamboling in the road,
is it a lesser sight for having no playmate?
[Rosado]
No, of course not.
[Louis]
I rest my case.
[Rosado]
You're a fascinating guy, Louis.
[Rosado]
We never talked much before, but now I really
wanna get to know you!
[Louis]
And I you, Rosado.
[Louis]
To that end, why don't you join me for tea?
I could serve it in a very charming tea set.
[Rosado]
Amazing. Let's go!

[Rosado]
Really? You don't think they're cute?
[Louis]
Don't test me, Rosado. I will never bend on this.
[Rosado]
Look closer. Not even a little?
[Louis]
Not in the least. They contain not a single iota
of cuteness.
[Rosado]
Weird! I know you like grapes, so I thought
you'd like these little guys too.
[Rosado]
I guess sea grapes aren't for everyone.
[Louis]
They are also seaweed─not grapes! They are
vile pretenders to the name. I despise them.
[Louis]
They resemble real grapes, but they are salty,
and after eating them, so was my language.
[Rosado]
Huh. Well, I like 'em.
[Rosado]
They're like cute little balls of ocean─they
taste like the sea!
[Louis]
I-is that so? My apologies, then.
[Rosado]
What are you apologizing for?
[Louis]
I try to appreciate the things my friends like,
to the extent that I can.
[Louis]
However, I draw the line at sea grapes!
[Rosado]
Haha, it's fine, Louis! We can like different
things and still remain friends.
[Louis]
Truly? Then would you object if I continue to
observe you?
[Louis]
I should hate to abandon the sight of my dear
Rosado going about his day.
[Rosado]
Of course! Get ready to burn the image of my
cuteness straight into your eyes!
[Louis]
Consider it burned!

[Rosado]
Hey, Louis. Hold still a sec, OK?
[Louis]
Paper and ink? Are you drawing a picture?
[Louis]
As I recall, you have a knack for drawing
landscapes with both speed and skill.
[Rosado]
Yup! My not-so-hidden talent.
[Louis]
But what is your subject here? The scenery
around us is somewhat drab.
[Rosado]
You, silly! I'm gonna draw you.
[Rosado]
I want a picture of you and me together.
I'll add myself later.
[Louis]
But wouldn't a simple self-portrait be much
more attractive on balance? I should think so.
[Rosado]
Maybe, but that's not what I'm going for. My
own cuteness isn't important for this one.
[Louis]
I beg your pardon?!
[Rosado]
I want a picture with you, Louis.
[Rosado]
I want a way to remember my friend when he's
not around.
[Louis]
Why, Rosado. How sweet of you!
[Rosado]
Hehe, I try.
[Louis]
Would you mind if I wore a mask?
[Rosado]
A mask?! Just because it's not all about looks
doesn't mean I don't want to draw your face!
[Louis]
It was only a suggestion.
[Rosado]
Keep your suggestions to yourself.
[Rosado]
Everyone else blushes and does what I say.
Why are you the difficult one?
[Louis]
Forgive me. I'm happy to be a part of your art,
of course, but it's also a bit embarrassing.
[Louis]
I'm not, um...cute.
[Rosado]
Let me stop you there. You're absolutely cute.
Especially when you're embarrassed.
[Rosado]
This is just a little memento for us to look back
on, that's all. If you don't want it, that's fine.
[Rosado]
But picture me, years from now, an old man─
desperate to remember my dear friend Louis.
[Louis]
Very well. For the sake of my friend and his
passion, I shall accept my fate.
[Rosado]
Thank you! OK, hold still a minute. This won't
take long.
[Rosado]
Someday we'll want to look back on this
moment. Now we'll have the perfect visual aid!
[Louis]
If I must endure this to commemorate our
friendship, then I shall do so gladly.
