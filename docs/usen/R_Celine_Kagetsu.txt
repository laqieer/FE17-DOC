[Kagetsu] 
Well, look what we have here. It is Princess 
Céline of Firene!
[Kagetsu] 
I trust you are well today, Princess Céline? 
Shall we take tea?
[Céline] 
Always brimming with energy, aren't you?
[Kagetsu] 
Naturally!
[Kagetsu] 
My spirits are constantly rising. I have plenty of 
cheer to share!
[Céline] 
Unfortunately, I've just come from teatime.
[Céline] 
But I should be happy to take you up on that 
offer at a later date.
[Kagetsu] 
That is disappointing. Perhaps you will indulge 
me in a round of mock combat, then?
[Kagetsu] 
Exercise is always good just after tea. Come 
now, show me your skill!
[Céline] 
Hahaha!
[Kagetsu] 
Hm? What is amusing to you?
[Céline] 
One moment you invite me to tea, and the next 
you challenge me to arms!
[Céline] 
There aren't many who would behave that way 
around a princess. You're a funny one.
[Kagetsu] 
Haha! Flattery will not get you anywhere!
[Céline] 
I shall pass on both the tea and the combat, 
but the two of us must sit and chat sometime.
[Kagetsu] 
Of course! That is what friends do.
[Céline] 
Indeed it is.

[Kagetsu] 
Princess Céline!
[Céline] 
Greetings, Kagetsu.
[Kagetsu] 
Hahaha! I have heard some interesting things.
[Kagetsu] 
I heard that, despite your royal position, you 
maintain excellent skill in swordsmanship.
[Kagetsu] 
This makes me all the more intrigued. Will you 
indulge me now? I am eager to see your skill.
[Céline] 
I appreciate the spirit of your offer, but I have 
no desire to fight without good reason.
[Kagetsu] 
Disappointing. Do you feel no desire at all to 
test your strength?
[Céline] 
I keep myself on form to protect my nation, 
but I've never sought to train for its own sake.
[Kagetsu] 
To each their own, I suppose. Shall we take tea, 
at least?
[Céline] 
I would love to. However, I first have some 
official business to tend to.
[Céline] 
It's merely a letter I'm composing to send home. 
Would you mind waiting?
[Kagetsu] 
Princesses lead busy lives, indeed.
[Céline] 
We do. I mustn't shirk my responsibilities.
[Kagetsu] 
Do you not find this life to be constraining? 
I would not be able to withstand it.
[Céline] 
A princess's life is not without hardship, but I 
do take a certain joy in it.
[Kagetsu] 
Is that so? I confess, I find it difficult to believe.
[Céline] 
Then the next time we meet, I'll show you 
exactly where that joy can be found.

[Kagetsu] 
Is this it?
[Céline] 
Yes. This is it.
[Kagetsu] 
I do not understand. How does this painting 
bring you joy?
[Kagetsu] 
It is of your kingdom, and it is impressively 
made, but beyond that I do not see.
[Céline] 
As we discussed, a princess's life is not without 
its hardships.
[Céline] 
But I take great joy in the sight of my people 
living in peace.
[Kagetsu] 
The ones depicted here do seem peaceful 
and happy, I agree.
[Céline] 
If I can ensure that their lives are tranquil and 
prosperous, then my own struggles are worth it.
[Kagetsu] 
I see now you carry a deep love of your country.
[Céline] 
I most certainly do!
[Kagetsu] 
I now understand what brings happiness 
to princesses.
[Kagetsu] 
For my part, I am much more happy to find 
opponents who match my skill in battle!
[Céline] 
Oh, yes... You wanted to spar with me.
[Céline] 
If you ever tried to harm Firene, you would find 
me to be a terrible and merciless opponent.
[Kagetsu] 
Much as I would like to see you terrible and 
merciless, I am unwilling to pay that cost.
[Céline] 
Haha, I am relieved to hear it.
[Kagetsu] 
Then if we cannot spar, let us take tea.
[Kagetsu] 
You always choose excellent leaves.
[Céline] 
That is a much better option. One in which 
we can remain friends.
[Kagetsu] 
To remain friends is always the goal!
