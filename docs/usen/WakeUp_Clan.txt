Divineâ”€ Oh! Still sleeping...
and doing it so well!


The Divine Dragon was asleep for a 
thousand years.
Which is a lot of time to practice.
Maybe I'll pray now, like I used to...


Ah! Good morning.
Haha... I was just admiring your skills.


I'm sorry. My excited voice was too excited!
But good morning. It's another beautiful day!


--- C2 ---

And who's on wake-up duty today?
It's Clanne! The 33rd Steward of the Dragon!


Is there a correct way for a steward to wake 
the Divine Dragon?
I suppose I could just call out normally.
I'll ask Vander how to do it. Wait, no. That'll 
make him mad.


Wah! I'm sorry.
This isn't a good way to wake you up.
But here's your morning greeting.
Good morning, Divine One!


Oh! You're awake?!
Being the first thing you see in the morning is 
a little unnerving!


--- B1 ---

It's Clanne, Divine One. I'm coming in.


Um, remember when you were worried 
about me?
And you ordered me to take it easy?
Thanks to you I'm full of energy again, haha!


Did you hear what I was just...
Ah, it was nothing. I just was saying...
Good morning.


Good morning.
Did you get a good rest?


--- B2 ---

Quietly... Quietly... Don't want to wake 
the Divine Dragon yet...


Time to clean the room while I can.
Hey, maybe I'll decorate too.
Flowers fit for a Divine Dragon! I'll set some 
here. And here.


Aah! How long have you been awake?!
No, I'm just doing some cleaning. Sorry.


Oh! Excuse me.
I thought I'd come in and clean your room while 
you slept.
But it looks like I woke you.

Divine One... It's me. Clanne.


I'm trying not to overwork myself anymore.
I don't want you to worry about me so much, 
Divine One.
I want you to always be happy.


Good morning.
You heard what I just said, didn't you?
You can't fool me.


Oh, are you awake?
It's going to be a great day!


--- A2 ---

My heart starts pounding every time I enter 
this room...


I used to see you sleeping every day.
I was so lucky to be a steward.
I always wondered what color your eyes were...


Are you awake, Divine One?
It's me, your steward. Clanne. Hi.
I'm really excited to help you today!


You were only pretending to sleep?!
Messing with me while I'm nervous, huh?! 
Hmph!


--- S1 ---

I-I'm here to wake you...


It still feels like a dream.
That I'm someone important to the 
Divine Dragon.
And that I have the Pact Ring.
Knowing you feel this way...
it's the pride of my whole life.
I will always, always...
be your loyal steward, Divine One.


Good morning. Give me your hand.
Just like the day you woke up...
I'm here for you from now on.


Haha! You woke up fast!
I knew I'd get you up quick. I'm pretty good 
at my job.


--- S2 ---

I've stopped being nervous when I come to 
wake you.


I always liked watching you sleep.
Back then you were a mystery, but now 
life is different. In a good way.
I know that you'll live longer than I will. But...
Please, always remember me.
And know that I was proud being your steward.


Good morning again.
Another day together.
Just me and the Divine Dragon.


Aw... You could have slept longer.
A-after all...
part of being a steward is making sure you get 
enough rest.
