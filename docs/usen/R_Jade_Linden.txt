[Lindon]
Ahh... HAA!


[Jade]
Sir Lindon? What are you doing?
[Lindon]
Ah, Jade! Hello.
[Lindon]
I was just baking some pastries with thunder
magic. I prefer them to be a bit...thundercooked.
[Lindon]
Oh! My, my...
[Lindon]
What is that book you're holding, I wonder?
[Lindon]
I've read just about every book ever written,
but I don't believe I recognize that cover.
[Jade]
I would be amazed if you had.
[Jade]
This is one of my novels. I wrote it myself.
[Lindon]
Oh, my stars! How wonderful! Please, you must
let me read it.
[Jade]
You want to read my book? I'll warn you, it's a
bit lighter in tone than you might prefer...
[Lindon]
So it's a comedy, eh? I see, I see. Well...that
only deepens my interest.
[Lindon]
I could do with a refreshing rise in tone. Is there
any way I could convince you to let me read it?
[Lindon]
What if I baked some pastries for you? Would
that help to seal the deal?
[Jade]
No need for that, though I appreciate the offer.
I would be honored just to hear your thoughts.
[Jade]
Unless you don't care for it, that is. Then we'll
both pretend we never had this conversation.
[Lindon]
Ah! So you will let me read it? Thank you, Jade!

[Lindon]
My goodness, Jade! I do believe I nearly busted
a gut with laughter, as the saying goes.
[Lindon]
It's clear that you have a considerable talent for
writing comedies.
[Jade]
That's high praise. Thank you, Sir Lindon.
[Lindon]
Your characters have so much life in them...
They practically leap off the page!
[Lindon]
How many of them are based on real people?
A few of our mutual friends did come to mind...
[Jade]
I may have slipped in a few parallels to certain
persons, living or dead.
[Lindon]
You have a keen eye for observation and a skill
for capturing them on the page...
[Lindon]
It was a magnificent novel, truly. I thank you
again for sharing your passion with me.
[Jade]
Of course. Thank you so much for reading it.
[Lindon]
I have a bit of that fire myself, truth be told. I've
chronicled my early years in a book of my own.
[Jade]
You have?
[Lindon]
Indeed. I haven't mentioned it to many people.
[Jade]
I would love to read it, if you wouldn't
mind sharing.
[Lindon]
Hohoho, wonderful! I hoped you might.
[Lindon]
What a thrill it is, having a fellow writer among
our ranks. I can hardly contain myself!
[Lindon]
If and when you have the time, we should
compare our lists of favorite comedies.
[Jade]
Yes, please! I would love that!
[Lindon]
What a fortuitous meeting this has been. And
here I thought nothing could surprise me...

[Lindon]
This was quite a welcome surprise, Jade!
[Lindon]
I had hardly put your last chapter down before
you presented me with this new one.
[Jade]
Well, now that you're reading my early drafts,
each editing pass goes much more smoothly.
[Lindon]
Ah, of course.
[Jade]
So? What did you think? Don't make me beg.
Because I will.
[Lindon]
It was...magnificent.
[Lindon]
I enjoyed this chapter even more than the last.
[Jade]
Ahh, that's such a relief to hear.
[Lindon]
Especially that new fellow who debuts in this
chapter! What a pleasant addition he was.
[Lindon]
He laughed, he cried... He felt truly alive! He
might be my new favorite character of yours.
[Lindon]
I must admit, I felt a certain kinship toward him.
[Jade]
I'm glad to hear that.
[Jade]
I hope you don't think it too presumptuous of
me, but I did model that character after you.
[Lindon]
Aha! I had a hunch! What a wonderful feeling,
to laugh along with your fictional counterpart.
[Lindon]
I now take his potent zest for life as the highest
of compliments.
[Lindon]
Again, thank you for letting me read your
marvelous book, Jade.
[Jade]
The honor is entirely mine, I promise.
[Lindon]
I think I'll bake some pastries to thank you.
You will have some, yes?
[Jade]
Glowing praise and warm pastries? Twist my
arm, why don't you.
