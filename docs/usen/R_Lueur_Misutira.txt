[Timerra]
Grilled and ready to go! This meat is so yummy
it's gonna make your taste buds dance.
[Alear]
Wow. That seems like a lot of meat for the
two of us.
[Timerra]
Oh, no. This one's for me. I was gonna do
yours next.
[Alear]
What?! How do you eat that much?!
[Timerra]
Oh, you know. Open my mouth, bite, chew.
I won't bore you with all the details.
[Alear]
Wow. You're really something, Timerra.
[Timerra]
...
[Timerra]
THAT'S TRUE! I'M REALLY SOMETHING!
[Timerra]
I'M THE CROWN PRINCESS OF SOLM! AND
I'M WEARING LOTS OF PRICELESS JEWELS!
[Alear]
Please, keep your voice down!
[Alear]
I've heard that this area isn't very safe.
[Timerra]
You can say that again. It's absolutely crawling
with bandits.
[Timerra]
That's why I'm out here like a nice, tempting
hunk of lamb on a spit.
[Alear]
Wait a minute... That was your plan?! To use
yourself as bait?!
[Timerra]
It worked, didn't it? Look. Those bruisers have
had their eye on us since we got here.
[Alear]
It looks like... It looks like they're getting ready
for an ambush!
[Timerra]
Not if we pounce on 'em first! Come on─this
oughta be a piece of cake for you and me!
[Alear]
Ugh, all right. But you know, a little heads-up
would have been nice!

[Timerra]
Thanks, Divine One. You really saved my bacon.
[Alear]
I was happy to help.
[Alear]
I will say, I wasn't expecting our picnic to turn
into a two-person raid on the bandits' hideout.
[Timerra]
Really? That's how most of my picnics go,
to be honest.
[Alear]
When you invited me, you said we'd be eating
meat together.
[Timerra]
And I was telling the truth! You got a nice big
helping, right?
[Alear]
Yes, I was stuffed. I only wish you had said
something like...
[Alear]
"I've found the bandits' camp, so let's barge in,
take them out, and then grill up some meat."
[Alear]
That would have been more, you know,
accurate.
[Timerra]
Hahaha! So wordy, though. My way was much
more concise.
[Alear]
That's one way to look at it.
[Alear]
Still, you never cease to amaze. You take it
upon yourself to help root out bandits...
[Timerra]
What, is that not normal?
[Timerra]
I'm just protecting my people. I thought that's
what royalty was supposed to do.
[Alear]
You say something completely radical like it's
the most obvious thing in the world.
[Timerra]
Hahaha! That's my charm!

[Timerra]
Hey, Divine One, it's meat o'clock! You in?
[Alear]
That depends. Will there be a surprise bandit-
hunting trip this time?
[Timerra]
Hehe! No, I promise it's just you, me, and some
fresh-grilled hunks of meat.
[Timerra]
I got a nice haul from the latest hunting trip,
and I wanna share the spoils!
[Alear]
All right. In that case, I'd be happy to partake.

[Alear]
Woof... I'm so full I can hardly move...
[Alear]
I must say, that was delicious. Good job at
the grill.
[Timerra]
Uh-oh.
[Alear]
What is it?
[Timerra]
OK, before you get mad...I really did intend for
this to be a plain old picnic.
[Timerra]
But there are some thugs surrounding us, and
it looks like they have other ideas.
[Alear]
What?! I thought we cleared them out!
[Timerra]
I thought so too. There must have been a
hideout I missed in my investigation.
[Alear]
Ah... There are a lot of them...
[Timerra]
I'll create a breach, and you run through
to safety.
[Alear]
Hm, good plan. But here's another to consider.
[Alear]
Let's take them all out and eliminate the bandit
threat once and for all.
[Alear]
If we do that, everyone in this entire region will
feel much more safe.
[Timerra]
Hehe! Hate to admit it, but I like that better.
[Alear]
I guess you're rubbing off on me.
[Timerra]
Come on! Let's make sure these jerks never
ruin a picnic again!
[Alear]
Right behind you!

[Timerra]
Divine One, you know the people of Solm value
freedom above everything else, right?
[Alear]
I do.
[Timerra]
That goes for me too. I love doing whatever
I want to do, whenever I want to do it! It's just...
[Timerra]
Do you ever feel chained down by your closest
friendships?
[Alear]
What do you mean?
[Timerra]
When we connect with people─you know, really
bond with them─those bonds make us stronger.
[Timerra]
I mean, our closest allies help us do things we
could never do all by ourselves.
[Timerra]
That's powerful stuff. But those bonds─those
friendships─can feel like obligations too.
[Alear]
I see what you mean, and you're not wrong.
[Alear]
Sometimes, when you care about someone, you
have to put their desires before your own.
[Alear]
That happens in close relationships.
[Timerra]
So, you have to give up close relationships to
really be free? Is that what you think?
[Alear]
I think you should take this.
[Timerra]
Is that...the Pact Ring?
[Alear]
Yes, and I want you to have it, Timerra.
[Timerra]
Me?! But why?
[Alear]
Because this will bring us closer together but
never take your freedom from you.
[Alear]
I care about you, Timerra, and I don't want you
to lose the thing you hold most dear.
[Timerra]
Do you really think you and I can have this
kind of a bond and also have our freedom?
[Alear]
Yes. I really do.
[Timerra]
That's so...beautiful. I suppose I have my
answer, then.
[Timerra]
I─ I'll accept the ring.
[Alear]
I promise you, though our hearts will remain
connected, you will be free.
[Timerra]
I like the sound of that very
much, .
[Timerra]
This will be our bond forever... No matter where
we are or where we go, we are always together.
