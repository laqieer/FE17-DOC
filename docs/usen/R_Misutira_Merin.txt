...
[Timerra] 
Hey, Merrin! You look like you're lost 
in thought.
[Merrin] 
Ah. You could say that, Princess Timerra.
[Timerra] 
Well? What's on your mind?
[Merrin] 
I was thinking about why I left my village.
[Timerra] 
Ah, yeah. You didn't want to become the next 
village matriarch.
[Merrin] 
Yes, that's right.
[Merrin] 
It was decided I had to take my mother's place, 
but I had always dreamed of being a knight.
[Merrin] 
The whole thing was...unreasonable. So I left.
[Timerra] 
You were a free spirit, even back then.
[Merrin] 
I wouldn't call myself a free spirit. Not really.
[Merrin] 
But after traveling on my own for a while, 
roaming with nowhere to go...
[Merrin] 
I met a fearless woman riding on a wolf. Now 
she was a free spirit.
[Timerra] 
Hehe! Who, me?
[Merrin] 
"Free spirit" may not even cover it. You took on 
an entire gang of bandits by yourself.
[Timerra] 
And out of nowhere, you charged in to help. 
I'll never forget that day.
[Merrin] 
Neither will I.
[Merrin] 
I didn't realize it then, but...that chance 
encounter would change my life.

[Timerra] 
Y'know, sitting with you by a toasty fire...it feels 
just like the good old days.
[Merrin] 
Yes. We shared many a night like this after that 
first encounterâ”€our scuffle with the bandits.
[Merrin] 
Back when we were just a couple of travelers 
roving the queendom together.
[Merrin] 
At the time, of course, I had no idea my princess 
was actually a princess.
[Timerra] 
You never asked. Honestly, I assumed you'd 
piece it together.
[Merrin] 
Listen, Princess Timerra.
[Merrin] 
Most royals don't sneak out of their castles to 
rain justice on unsuspecting bandits.
[Timerra] 
Yeah, well. I'm not most royals.
[Merrin] 
Haha, no argument there.
[Merrin] 
But really. Do you remember how shocked I was 
to learn that you were the princess of Solm?
[Merrin] 
I had just gotten through telling you...basically 
my whole life story.
[Merrin] 
How I had always dreamed of becoming a 
knight, but my lineage made it impossible.
[Merrin] 
I told you that was the reason I ran away 
from home.
[Merrin] 
And then, you...
[Timerra] 
I asked if you really, truly wanted to be a knight.
[Merrin] 
And I said, "Yes. With my whole heart, yes."
[Merrin] 
You placed your sword on my shoulders, one 
after the other, and said...
[Timerra] 
"I hereby deem thee a knight of the queendom."
[Merrin] 
And I laughed! I thought it was all in fun.
[Merrin] 
But you weren't laughing, my princess. You 
were looking at me like you meant it.

[Merrin] 
I'll never forget the look on your face when you 
knighted me. So serious.
[Timerra] 
Well, yeah! I was dead set on it.
[Timerra] 
After all our time on the road together, I could 
see what a good person you were.
[Timerra] 
I'd have been crazy not to pin you down as 
soon as I could.
[Merrin] 
Hahaha, my princess. You flatter me.
[Merrin] 
Though I do wish you had revealed your 
identity beforehand...
[Timerra] 
This again! It just slipped my mind, that's all. 
I told you right after, didn't I?
[Timerra] 
We even went to your village together.
[Merrin] 
Yes, that's true.
[Merrin] 
The way you bowed your head before my 
mother, the village matriarch...
[Merrin] 
And then boldly asked if she'd give the 
knighting her blessing.
[Merrin] 
I've never seen her so shocked. But she agreed 
on the condition that I return to lead one day.
[Timerra] 
Your mother's a good woman. She could tell 
our hearts were set on it.
[Merrin] 
Haha.
[Merrin] 
From then on, I was yours.
[Merrin] 
That was the day the clouds opened and my life 
filled with sunlight.
[Timerra] 
And you called me a flatterer.
[Merrin] 
So help me, your radiant luster will never dim.
[Merrin] 
That, my princess, is why I devote myself 
wholly to your service.
[Timerra] 
Thank you, Merrin.
[Timerra] 
I hope you'll stay at my side, now and forever. 
My knight in shining armor. My friend.
