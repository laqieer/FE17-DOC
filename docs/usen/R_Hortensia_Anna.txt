[Hortensia]
This army's too pretty. It's not right.
[Hortensia]
How am I supposed to be the cutest when the
competition is this gorgeous?!

[Anna]
Aha, say no more!
[Hortensia]
Wait, you're...
[Anna]
Only a troubled maiden's best friend─the one
and only Lady Anna! Cha-ching!
[Anna]
If it's cuteness you're after, Princess Hortensia,
you might be interested in my beauty line!
[Hortensia]
You have my attention! I should tell you,
though, I'm kinda picky about product.
[Anna]
I guarantee satisfaction with everything I sell.
[Anna]
After all, what I've got on offer today is tailored
just for you!
[Hortensia]
You're confident. I like that. OK, show me what
you got.
[Anna]
Of course!
[Anna]
First is this pink rouge. Just a dab stays on all
day. Apply it in the morning and forget about it!
[Hortensia]
Ooo...
[Anna]
There's also lipstick, soap, skin cleanser, and
a crystal enchanted to add shine to your hair.
[Anna]
And finally, an accessory case to hold it all. The
rainbow palette makes you cute just holding it!
[Hortensia]
These are...INCREDIBLE! I've gotta have 'em─
I'll take 'em all!
[Anna]
Thanks for the business! Ooh, I'm making
a killing!
[Hortensia]
You deserve it─your stuff's impressive.
I'm gonna be more adorable than ever!
[Anna]
Indulge me in a little market research. Why do
you want to be cute, Princess Hortensia?
[Hortensia]
Uh, because the cuter you are, the more people
like you, obviously.
[Anna]
So it's a popularity thing for you, huh?
[Hortensia]
Of course. Anyway, I'm off─gotta see how all
this is gonna come together for my look.
[Hortensia]
Thanks, Lady Anna!

[Hortensia]
...
[Anna]
Why the long face, Princess Hortensia?
[Hortensia]
I tried your whole beauty line, but something's
still not quite right.
[Anna]
Are you saying...you're a dissatisfied customer?
[Hortensia]
No, the products are great... They're just not
making me as happy as I thought they would.
[Anna]
Don't be so sure! My beauty line is tried, tested,
and terrific.
[Anna]
It's expanded a bit since last time too. I'm now
stocking my own brand of magic perfume.
[Hortensia]
Magic perfume? Is that a thing?
[Anna]
Yup. This enchanted aroma will put your
cuteness over the top for sure.
[Anna]
Its magical potency more than makes up for the
lack of staying power. I'd swear by it!
[Hortensia]
It can really do all that?
[Anna]
Don't take my word for it. Give it a try!
[Hortensia]
Ooo, that does smell delightful! Let's see what
a spritz does for me. What do you think?
[Anna]
Whoa! I think we found the missing piece of the
puzzle! It works even better than I thought!
[Hortensia]
Really? My image is finally complete?
I'm entirely irresistible?!
[Anna]
Oh, absolutely!
[Anna]
Tell you what, I'll give you a little as a sample.
If you like it, come back and buy it, OK?

[Hortensia]
Hey, Lady Anna? Can I talk to you for a minute?
[Anna]
Oh, Princess Hortensia! How'd it go with that
perfume? Ready to place a full order yet?
[Hortensia]
I've decided not to buy any, actually.
[Anna]
Huh? Did it not work?
[Hortensia]
Oh, no, it worked great. My whole look came
together. I was the center of attention.
[Hortensia]
Even so...the perfume's not for me.
[Anna]
But why? You seemed like you had your heart
set on being popular.
[Hortensia]
I love wearing makeup and perfume, but I think
I'll steer clear of the enchanted stuff.
[Hortensia]
Magic is a shortcut. I want people to be wowed
by my cuteness and charm─not by a gimmick.
[Anna]
Oh...
[Anna]
Sorry, Princess Hortensia. I guess I pitched you
the wrong product.
[Hortensia]
No, it was exactly what I needed at the time.
I wouldn't have realized how I felt otherwise.
[Hortensia]
Really, I'm nothing but grateful.
[Anna]
Whoa.
[Anna]
You're more amazing to me now than when you
were wearing that perfume.
[Hortensia]
Aw, thanks! From now on, my charm is gonna
be just that. No quick fixes. All me.
[Anna]
And I'm gonna keep building my business until
I'm the number-one merchant in the world!
[Hortensia]
Sounds like a plan, young lady.
[Anna]
On that note, do you want to have another look
at my non-magical beauty line?
[Anna]
Beauty products or otherwise, I've got all the
tools you need in your quest for popularity!
[Hortensia]
Haha, go on, you smooth talker!
