[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle, I've found you.
[Veyle] 
Oh, I didn't know you were looking for me.
[Mauvier] 
I was, indeed.
[Mauvier] 
Perhaps you don't realize, it is not safe for 
you to walk through town alone.
[Veyle] 
Not safe?
[Veyle] 
Why do you say that? This town is full of 
good people.
[Mauvier] 
Considering what we have done, some of these 
good people might rightfully want revenge.
[Veyle] 
If that happens, then I'll apologize. We did...truly 
awful things.
[Mauvier] 
An apology might well not be enough. 
If something were to happen to you...
[Veyle] 
I'm not a child. I can take care of myself. 
Now stop following me.
[Mauvier] 
Wait. Please!
[Veyle] 
No. I have something I need to do...on my own.
[Veyle] 
[Mauvier] 
There she goes.
[Mauvier] 
She has no idea what she is risking.

[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle seems safe enough. For the time 
being anyway.
[Mauvier] 
I must not be noticed following her. I will stay 
back and observe without being seen.
[Mauvier] 
I cannot imagine explaining to Marni that 
I allowed harm to befall Lady Veyle.

[Veyle] 
Mauvier! I see you following me.
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle?!
[Veyle] 
So, you don't think I can take care of myself? 
Is that what this is?
[Mauvier] 
No. Or, rather, yes. I mean, I know you are very 
capable. But I also worry.
[Mauvier] 
It is my duty as a knight to keep you safe.
[Veyle] 
You're not just a knight, you're also my friend. 
Instead of worrying about me, try trusting me.
[Mauvier] 
A friend? I did not know.
[Mauvier] 
If that is the case, please tell me why you walk 
through town alone.
[Mauvier] 
As your friend, I am concerned for your safety. 
I want to understand why you would do that.
[Veyle] 
...
[Veyle] 
I do it to atone for my sins.
[Veyle] 
A lot of people were hurt because of me. I need 
to find something good I can do for this town.
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle... Since that is the case, it is 
important that I be by your side.
[Mauvier] 
As one of the Four Hounds, I also committed 
sins for which I must atone.
[Mauvier] 
You are not alone in your feelings...or your goal.
[Veyle] 
You have such a good heart, Mauvier.
[Veyle] 
And I'm lucky to have you as a friend.
[Veyle] 
So, will you help me? Can we find something 
good to do for this town together?
[Mauvier] 
Of course, Lady Veyle...

[Veyle] 
Oh, the townsfolk seem so pleased! I can barely 
believe all the thanks pouring in.
[Mauvier] 
Yes, the people do seem most appreciative. 
But our work has only just begun.
[Veyle] 
I hope they know our feelings are genuine and 
that we mean them well.
[Mauvier] 
I was concerned they would hold a grudge. 
Revenge makes more sense than forgiveness.
[Veyle] 
I told you. The people here are good.
[Mauvier] 
Indeed. You were right.
[Mauvier] 
It is wonderful that they welcomed us so.
[Veyle] 
...
[Veyle] 
You know, there's something I've been 
thinking about.
[Veyle] 
I wonder if Marni would have ever been willing 
to walk through these streets with us.
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle...
[Mauvier] 
I do not dare to guess. But this much I know...
[Mauvier] 
If Marni would have fought on this side, she'd 
have been a knight beloved by the people.
[Veyle] 
Oh yes, they would have loved her.
[Veyle] 
If it weren't for Marni, I would have never had 
this chance to make things right.
[Veyle] 
It's impossible to express how grateful I am for 
what she did.
[Mauvier] 
She would have loved to hear your praise.
[Mauvier] 
Let the two of us live to save as many people as 
we can. For Marni.
[Veyle] 
I like that.
[Veyle] 
We have so many wrongs to make up for. 
I don't know how we'll ever balance the scales.
[Veyle] 
I guess we'll just have to add as much good 
to this world as we possibly can.
[Veyle] 
Will you help me, Mauvier?
[Mauvier] 
Of course. As a knight...and as a friend.
[Mauvier] 
We do this together, Lady Veyle.
