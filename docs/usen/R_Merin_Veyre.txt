=== Merrin & Veyle ===

[Merrin]
Dragon, dragon, dragoooon! You are a
REAL dragon!
[Merrin]
Do you know how cool that is! I mean, how cool
you are? So, so, so cool!
[Veyle]
Um...
[Veyle]
I am a dragon. But I'm a Fell Dragon, not
a Divine Dragon. Aren't you...afraid of me?
[Merrin]
Not at all! Honestly, I'm just so happy I have
this chance to talk with you, Lady Veyle.
[Veyle]
Oh, I see.
[Veyle]
It's just strange because most people are
frightened of me...or dislike me.
[Merrin]
Well, I'm from a small village, so I can't help
but admire unique people and unusual things.
[Merrin]
And I could never dislike a being I admire as
much as I do you.
[Veyle]
I am unique and unusual, I suppose.
[Merrin]
I'm sorry, does it bother you that I approached
you like this?
[Veyle]
No. I don't mind. I think perhaps you are...
unusual in your own way, aren't you?
[Merrin]
Me? Unusual? You could say that, I guess.
That makes us the same, doesn't it?
[Veyle]
Oh!
[Merrin]
I'm so sorry, Lady Veyle. That was awfully
presumptuous of me. I shouldn't have said that.
[Veyle]
No. It's fine. I was just a bit surprised.
[Veyle]
To be honest, I'm happy you thought I might be
similar to...a human.
[Veyle]
Merrin, why don't we be friends? Two unusual
people who found one another.

[Merrin]
You are so incredible, Lady Veyle. I'm filled with
wonder every time I look at you.
[Merrin]
Your hair, your skin, the way you carry yourself.
Perfect! I mean, you're a dragon, so of course.
[Veyle]
I suppose.
[Merrin]
I do what I can with my own appearance, but
I can't come anywhere near your level of cool.
[Merrin]
As a dragon, do you have to put effort into
looking good? Or does it just happen naturally?
[Veyle]
I don't think I do anything special. I don't really
know much about that stuff.
[Merrin]
You look this cool without doing anything
special?! Dragons are so incredible.
[Veyle]
...
[Veyle]
Um, Merrin...
[Veyle]
I wonder, do you only find me...cool because
I'm a dragon?
[Merrin]
Oh! No, Lady Veyle, not at all! I think you're
cool because of who you are. I really do.
[Merrin]
But I have to ask, do you feel ashamed that
you're a dragon?
[Veyle]
Yes, of course I do. My whole life people have
hated me because of it.
[Merrin]
That's not your fault. That's their fault. They
hated you without really knowing you.
[Veyle]
But I must have some bad qualities for people
to hate me that much.
[Merrin]
Nobody is perfect─nobody. And you can't
change the fact that you're a dragon.
[Merrin]
You have to embrace who you are and what
you are. You're a dragon, and that's wonderful.
[Veyle]
Wonderful?
[Merrin]
Exactly. Dragons are unusual and unique and
wonderful! You should take pride in that!
[Veyle]
You are very convincing.
[Veyle]
If you believe it, then maybe I can try to believe
it too.

[Veyle]
Merrin, thank you.
[Merrin]
What?!
[Merrin]
Why are you thanking me all of a sudden?
[Veyle]
You told me I should take pride in the fact that
I'm a dragon.
[Veyle]
I'm not sure I can truly see it as a positive
thing yet, but...
[Veyle]
But everything you said makes me think I might
feel good about it...one day.
[Veyle]
So, thank you, Merrin.
[Merrin]
Lady Veyle...
[Merrin]
...
[Veyle]
Merrin? What's wrong?!
[Merrin]
I-I'm all right... I'm just so happy you feel that
way. I can't help crying.
[Merrin]
I will never forget this moment as long as I live!
[Veyle]
It's OK! You don't need to make a big deal out
of it. Hehe, oh, you are unusual, aren't you?
[Merrin]
The both of us! What an unusual pair we make.
[Veyle]
Hehe, yes we do.
[Merrin]
That's it. I've made up my mind!
[Merrin]
From now on, I'm going to help you figure out
what's so great about being a dragon.
[Merrin]
No one loves dragons more than I do, so that
makes me the perfect person for the job.
[Merrin]
I'm going to find you so many reasons why
being a dragon is cool!
[Veyle]
I'm so excited! And I'm so glad you're the one
to help me with this.
[Merrin]
And just like that, I've already found one reason.
[Merrin]
You are kind! And all those experiences you had
during your long life as a dragon made you kind.
[Veyle]
I see. Hehe, but now you're making me blush.
[Merrin]
Oh, this is just the beginning. I'm going to find
you a hundred─no, a thousand─reasons!
[Merrin]
You'd better prepare yourself, Lady Veyle.
[Veyle]
OK! I'm ready! You know, for the first time,
I might actually be looking forward to life.
[Veyle]
And it's all because of you, Merrin.
