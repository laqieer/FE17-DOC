[Alfred] 
Here we are─the kingdom of Firene.
[Alear] 
What a beautiful place.
[Alfred] 
Isn't it? And no sign of the Corrupted, so 
that's good.
That was quite a trip, crossing the sea all the 
way from Lythos. I hope you're not worn out.
[Alear] 
I'm fine.
[Alfred] 
Good, good. Listen, I'm sorry for twisting your 
arm to come with me.
[Alear] 
Alfred, it's all right. I wanted to come.
How about before we arrive at the castle, you 
tell me more about this kingdom of yours?
[Alfred] 
Happy to! Let's see...
Firene is one of the four nations of Elyos, 
in the southwest.
It's ruled by my mother, Queen Ève. We're 
known as a...land of plenty.
Our people value peace above all else. 
We haven't seen war for centuries.
[Alear] 
You must come from a long line of 
capable leaders.
[Alfred] 
That's kind of you to say. Peace doesn't 
always come easy.
Mother had to hammer out a nonaggression 
pact with our neighbors.
The pact says there won't be war between us, 
Solm, and Brodia.
[Alear] 
Right─Solm, the Queendom of Freedom and 
Brodia, the Kingdom of Might.
[Alfred] 
You've got it. Solm is an open-minded country. 
They've always had good relations with Firene.
But an alliance with Brodia took some doing. 
Their king's an ambitious man.
He's always launching attacks on Elusia to 
expand his own territory.
[Alear] 
I take it Elusia isn't in the alliance.
[Alfred] 
No. Honestly, they're so far away, we don't 
interact with them too much.
We know it's snowy there, with long winters... 
and that some Elusians worship the Fell Dragon.
[Alear] 
The Fell Dragon?
[Alfred] 
It's troubling, I know. But...people can believe 
what they believe.
Sorry... I didn't bring it up to turn you 
against Elusia.
[Alear] 
It's not them I hate─it's the Fell Dragon. 
Him and the one who killed my mother.
Can you tell me more about the Emblem Ring 
that was entrusted to Firene?
[Alfred] 
Oh, sure. It's the "Ring of the Caring Princess." 
Doesn't look like anything special.
Until I met you and Marth, I thought the 
Emblems were legends.
I can't wait to tell my sister they exist! She'll 
really be knocked for a loop.
[Alear] 
You have a sister?
[Alfred] 
Yeah─the princess of Firene, Céline. She's at 
the castle with Mother right now.
[Alear] 
Princess Céline. I look forward to meeting her.
[Alfred] 
Just call her Céline. I'm sure you two will get 
along great.
Here's Florra Mill Town. The castle's close now. 
We'll just cut through here, and...
Something's off.
[Alear] 
What is it?
[Alfred] 
I think there might be trouble ahead.

[Alear] 
The Corrupted. They're everywhere.
[Alfred] t

[Alfred] 
I can't stand to see them overrunning this 
peaceful town.
[Alfred]

I have to drive them away. Divine One, will you 
help me?
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
Of course.

[Céline] 
Danger looms from every side. I fear we will 
never make it to my brother.
[Louis] 
Princess Céline. I beg you to make your retreat. 
We'll handle this.
[Chloé] 
More of the fiends might be on the way. Hurry!
[Céline] 
Louis! Chloé! You can't possibly expect me to─
[Louis] 
It is our sworn duty to protect the princess. We 
will hold the line for you as long as we must!
[Chloé] 
You have to leave. If you should fall here, who 
warns Prince Alfred of the invasion to come?
[Céline] 
I concede the point. But I'll return for you both. 
Please hold out until then!
[Céline] 
[Louis] 
Apologies, Chloé.
It pains me greatly to separate you from Princess Céline, 
for even a relatively brief amount of time.
[Chloé] 
Might I say, I'm a bit disappointed I didn't get to 
see you run off with Her Highness yourself.
A knight should never leave his princess's side.
[Louis] 
The sooner we win, the sooner that will come to 
pass. What say you, Chloé? Shall we?
[Chloé] 
Yes! Let's!

Céline? What are you doing here? I thought 
you were with Mother.
[Céline] Sad 

[Céline] 
I was, but... Alfred, the Elusian army is marching 
on the castle.
[Alfred] 
What? Why?
[Céline] 
I cannot say. Before they arrived, Mother sent 
me to warn you.
But then we were ambushed on our way to 
Florra Port...
[Céline] 
Angry 
Louis and Chloé stayed behind so that I might 
have a chance to escape.
Please, we must hurry back to them!
[Alfred] 
Angry 
[Alfred] 
Absolutely.

Pardon me, Princess Céline, but do you have 
the Emblem Ring?

[Céline] 
Yes. Mother gave it to me. Why do you...

Goodness gracious! The Divine Dragon

I am.

I must protect the people of this village and 
ensure Louis and Chloé's safety.

[Alear] 
You saved my life. Thank you.
[Veyle] 
It was nothing, really! I only did what anyone 
else would do.
[Alear] 
Are you here by yourself?
[Veyle] 
I am. I saw the fighting and thought I could help.
[Alear] 
You're braver than I am. I can't stand 
the Corrupted.
I was so startled I couldn't think. You really did 
save my life.
[Veyle] 
I see...
[Alear] 
Oh, I haven't introduced myself yet. I'm the 
Divine Dragon .

What a lovely name. I'm Veyle.

[Marth] 
Might I interrupt?
[Alear] 
What is it?
[Marth] 
Even with the Corrupted gone, it may not be 
safe for her out here.
Perhaps we should escort her home or to 
an inn.
[Veyle] 

[Alear] 
That's a good idea.
Hey, Veyle, do you live around here?
Huh?
She's gone...

Divine One!
[Alear] 
Céline.
Did you see a girl pass this way? Small with 
long hair? Barefoot?
[Céline] 
No, I'm afraid I didn't see anyone matching 
that description.
[Alear] 
OK, thanks. Did you need something?
[Céline] 
I wanted to thank you.
Alfred told me that you accepted Firene's 
request for aid.
And your help in the battle was the difference 
between victory and defeat. Thank you, truly.
[Alear] 
Don't mention it.
Alfred and I are friends. I was happy to help.
[Céline] 
Friends? He said that? Imagine speaking so 
casually with the Divine Dragon...
Please, allow me to apologize on his behalf.
[Alear] 
There's no need to put me on a pedestal.
I just woke up, and the world is new to me. 
I make mistakes like anyone.
[Céline] 
Is that so? I thought surely the Divine Dragon 
would be an all-seeing, all-powerful being.
But here I find that you are rather more...human 
than I expected. Perhaps we can be friends.
[Alear] 
Then what do you say, Céline? Friends?
[Céline] 
I would be honored.

Name's Durthon. I'm an armorer. And this 
here's Anisse, purveyor of goods.
We saw you tradin' thumps with those things. 
Figured you might be in the market for supplies.
道具屋 
Yes. If you need, we'd be happy to provide you 
with quality weapons and items.
Anything to defeat those creatures. They pose 
a terrible threat to traveling merchants like us.
[Alear] 
How would you feel about moving to our 
base? You can sell your wares from there.
[Vander] 
Ahem, Divine One...
[Alear] 
What? We don't have any facilities. These two 
could be a good addition.
武器屋 
You're gonna let us open shops at your base?
[Alear] 
If you'd like to. We'll need plenty of weapons 
and items from here on out.
It's a haven. You won't find any creatures there.
武器屋 
You got yourself a bargain! Can't wait to 
do business together.
道具屋 
Thank you for this. I will do my utmost to 
ensure you receive the finest items.

Good idea! While their spells will go right 
through your armor, I'm resistant to magic.
So leave the mages to me. It's not so bad

Indeed. This is a nice change of pace.

It was in the Ring Vault. Vander found it after

Why? Do you know what this is?

The Draconic Time Crystal. An artifact capable 
of reversing time itself.
There is a limit to its power, but still, it could 
give us a keen advantage.
