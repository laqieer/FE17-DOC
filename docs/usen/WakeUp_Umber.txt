Here comes your waker-upper for today...
AMBER!


Always make a bold entrance!
That's how a hero does things.
OK, next...how should I wake you up?
I'll try to be gentle...
Got it! How about a soft breeze blowing past 
your face? *sputtering noises*


Hi!
Oh, I should do my entrance again.
It's me, the waking-upping legend AM─ Huh? 
That's enough? OK.


Oh! You're a quick riser, despite the rumors!
Good mornin'!

So this is the legendary altar where the 
Divine Dragon sleeps?
I am so pumped!


But I'm also nervous...
The Somniel is ultra-sacred ground.
This place is on a whole other level.
Don't mess up...
My foot! Waaah!


Ow... I'm so sorry, Divine One!
I tripped, but nothing broke, so...
Good morning!


Oops! Did I wake you? And it's so early...
Was I, uh...too loud?
Yikes. Sorry, Divine One.


--- B1 ---

Knock, knock! It's me!


The alpaca hero is here-o!
Come on, wake up! It's me, Amber!
Here, open those eyes and watch me strike 
a pose!


Morning, Divine One!
A gallant pose is the best way to start the 
day, right?
What? You wanna go back to bed?! Aww, 
come on!


Oh, you woke up before I could finish my big 
entrance... Good morning!

*nasal alpaca whines*


This brings back memories.
Back home...
the alpacas ignored my wake-up calls too.
Better try again. *nasal alpaca noises*


Hey!
I just said, "You don't want to sleep in, do you?"
Up and at 'em, Divine One! Let me help you 
get ready.


Nice job, Divine One!
You understood my alpacan just now!
I was saying, "Time to wake up!"


--- A1 ---

There's a legend about the altar the Divine 
Dragon sleeps on.
And today, I find out if it's true!


By this altar, at this exact time, behind this 
exact pillar, in this exact pose...
Now I just make a wish! Or so I heard.
Ooh, Divine Dragon! Please wake up right now!


Whoa! My wish was granted! The legend is true!
Now that you're awake...
do you wanna hang out?


Or not.
Since you're up, I'll just save it for next time.
Oh, wait! Divine One! Do you know anything 
about the legend in here?


--- A2 ---

*nasal alpaca whine*
Divine One! I've come to wake you!


You've started listening for the alpacas too...
I'm not alone anymore.
And that's helping me focus on becoming a 
legendary hero!


Morning!
Huh? A message from the alpacas?
"When you become a hero...buy us 
expensive hay"?
Those jokers! Of course I will.


Oh! You're quick to rise today!
Huh? You heard far-off alpacas again? 
Just now?!
Wh-what were they saying?!


--- S1 ---

Hey, Divine One! Your fellow sword Amber has 
come to wake you!


Still asleep, huh? Perfect time to test this 
legendary altar again.
This spot, this time, this pillar, this pose...
and any wish I make will be granted.
I won't wish for the Divine Dragon to wake up 
this time...
I'll just wish for them to always be happy.
And...I wish to always stay by their side...


Morning! I was just making a wish.
Huh? You want to know what I wished for?
I wished that I could stay by your side forever! 
You'd be OK with that...right?


Huh? I should wake you more quietly?
Oh. Sorry. Here, let me try again.
Good morning!
How's this? Any better?


--- S2 ---

Guess who's here?
*drumroll sound*
It's me!


Ooo, I'm pretty tired.
I have been running around a lot of battlefields.
But we're fellow swords, you and me.
I remember what you said.
I may not be able to make things better for you, 
or protect you...
But as your fellow sword, I'll stay right by 
your side.
I'll be here to support you when you need 
it most.


Did I wake you?
*nasal alpaca whine*
That means...
"I'm still bound to you─forever!"
But, uh, I guess you already knew that.


Ah! You must've been looking forward to my 
wake-up call!
Y'know...
Whenever I get assigned wake-up duty...
I just get so happy!
