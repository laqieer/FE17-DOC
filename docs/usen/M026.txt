=== Chapter 26 The Last Engage ===

(Portal to Other Worlds)

--- OP ---


[Marth]
The final battle is upon us. When you're ready,
we will move the Somniel itself to the portal.
Once we face the Fell Dragon, there may be no
turning back.
Are you ready of mind and equipped for
what's ahead?




[Alear]
The Somniel is ascending. We should reach
Sombron soon.
Let's win this battle, and then return
home together.
[Marth]
Yes. Of course...
Ugh...
[Alear]
Marth! What's happening to you?!
[Marth]
I can't hide this any longer, can I?
[Alear]
Hide what?
[Marth]
There's something I should tell you before we
arrive, .
The portal has destabilized our world.
I lack physical form, as do the other Emblems.
We may not be able to hold ourselves together.
[Alear]
I had no idea. I wish I had realized...
But if the portal is doing this, then it's only
temporary, right?
After we close it, you and the other Emblems
will recover.
[Marth]
...
The moment the portal closes, there will be
a great distortion.
We will not be able to withstand it.
[Alear]
What are you saying?
[Marth]
When the battle is done, and the portal closed,
all Emblems aside from you...
will cease to be.
[Alear]
...
You mean, if we defeat Sombron... If we close
the portal...
we'll lose you and the other Emblems?
[Marth]
Yes.
[Alear]
We've been together this whole time, and now
you're just going to disappear?
Please, Marth... I don't want to lose you and
the others! We need you!
[Marth]
Leaving the portal open would doom this world.
Would you prefer that?
[Alear]
No, but...
[Marth]
We Emblems came into existence in order to
aid this realm.
We would do anything to protect the people
of Elyos. Even if it means our end.
[Alear]
So our promise to rebuild Elyos together─our
plan to see the world─none of that is possible?
[Marth]
I'm so sorry, .
[Alear]
There's no need to apologize.
I've asked so much of you... Too much.
But when I thought about a future with you by
my side...I felt truly happy.
[Marth]
There is a promise I can still keep.
In Lythos, the day you awoke... What did I say
when you summoned me?
"Your ally, until the very end."
[Alear]
I remember.
[Marth]
I will never break that promise. Until this war's
end─until my own─I will stay by your side.
[Alear]
You're so kind, Marth. You have always been
so kind.
[Marth]
You are too. That's why we've made it this far.
More than your strength, it's your care for
others that has brought us all here.
[Alear]
Thank you.
[Marth]
Now, prepare yourself. We'll arrive at the
portal soon.
[Alear]
I'm ready.



[Alear]
So this is the portal to other worlds...
[Veyle]
It's beautiful, but...very cold.


[Sombron]
You two. Here.
[Alear]
Sombron!
[Veyle]
Papa...
[Sombron]
I did not expect you to survive, let alone reach
me here.
[Alear]
We've come to stop you from destroying Elyos.
[Sombron]
I am done with your worthless world. Return
to it, and shut the portal. Live in peace there.
You stay in your world. I now leave for
other ones. That should satisfy us both.
[Alear]
You're going to return and attack Elyos again.
We'll never believe you wouldn't!
And you've caused too much suffering─too
much loss─to run free.
We will defeat you right now, and prevent you
from invading any other worlds.
[Sombron]
Hmph. Invading other worlds. You think my
desire is so simple?
[Alear]
Am I wrong?
[Sombron]
Invasion is merely a means to an end. What I
seek is a reunion.
A reunion with Zero Emblem.
[Alear]
Zero Emblem?
[Marth]
I've not heard word of this before.
[Sombron]
Of course not. That Emblem is not of
your world.
Nor am I.
[Alear]
What do you mean?
[Sombron]
Beyond this portal lie infinite worlds. One of
them was my home.
It had its own Emblem Rings, and a war arose
to control them.
My kind lost. The enemy used the rings' power
to slaughter my relatives.
All of them. I was very young... Our enemies
granted me alone the mercy of exile.
[Marth]
You mean...they sent you to Elyos.
[Sombron]
A peaceful world, ruled by godlike dragons.
I was meant to live a quiet life there.
But I brought something with me, unknown
to them. A single Emblem Ring.
[Alear]
Zero Emblem.
[Sombron]
In my world, known as the Emblem of
Foundations. With my power, unable to speak.
Legend said this Emblem fought without aid.
So much ambition, and no allies.
That story showed me the way forward in my
complete isolation.
I was trapped in this world without friends or
family. Only that Emblem gave me comfort.
[Marth]
Whoever it was must have been mighty indeed.
An Emblem should not be able to survive
traveling from one world to another.
To stay in form in a new world, even for
moments... I've never heard of such power.
[Alear]
Now you want a reunion. So that Emblem
is gone.
[Sombron]
Exactly─and all because of villagers that found
me a few years after I arrived.
They mistook me for an abandoned child. They
pitied me─my first connection in your world.
Soon after, the Emblem deserted me, leaving
only the ring behind.
And why? For bonding with the people of this
world. I despaired, and then...
I reduced their village to ash.
[Alear]
...
[Sombron]
I swore to forgo all bonds in pursuit of my
ambitions, as my Emblem had.
I fought alone, confided in none, preparing to
return to my world. To exact revenge.
I needed pawns for my plan─and territory.
I spent years amassing it all. Then, I attacked.
[Alear]
So, the war a thousand years ago... That's what
it was about?
[Veyle]
But, Papa, you weren't alone in this world.
Mama loved you deeply. Your believers, your
attendants...my siblings...
Zephia, Griss, Marni, Mauvier... My brother
and me! Everything we did was for you!
Zephia, Griss, Marni, Mauvier... My sister
and me! Everything we did was for you!
[Sombron]
As I said, pawns. Acting on my command and
mine alone.
Meant to be used and discarded. Deaths which
mean nothing.
[Veyle]
That's why you killed them all... But what about
us? You wanted us to die?
[Sombron]
You were no different to me.
[Veyle]
How...horrible.
[Alear]
You can't be right about your Emblem. You
weren't left behind.
[Sombron]
What?
[Alear]
A solitary warrior like that Emblem would know
how hard it is to be alone.
And...would stay by your side, sparing you that
loneliness in exile.
Until you weren't alone, and had new people
in your life. Until you were OK.
Don't you think, more than anyone, a true friend
like that wanted you to have those connections?
[Sombron]
You know nothing─nothing at all about
my Emblem.
[Alear]
That's true. But if your Emblem disappeared
without a word...
Then you don't either. No one does.
[Sombron]
All the more reason to be reunited! I will scour
world after world!
[Marth]
Sombron. The Emblem of Foundations is
no more.
You can search and search─but there's
no point.
You might meet the original hero. But Emblems
are not the same beings─we are not them.
You will never be reunited with your Emblem─
ever again.
[Sombron]
Be silent.
[Alear]
I can only imagine how much resentment you
feel. But to sacrifice so many others...
To be so selfish you'd destroy the world? Kill
your own children?! It's all just so...wrong.
[Sombron]
I said, be silent! You are speaking of things you
do not understand!
If not for my Emblem I would have died
powerless. Small.
That Emblem had the strength to stand alone!
Unlike you, huddled together, whining like dogs.
Such a warrior showed me the meaning of all
existence─fight alone, take revenge!
[Marth]
You're wrong. That's impossible. No Emblem
wants to see a world destroyed.
We aid people through our bonds with the
Divine Dragons. We are a force for good!
We would never choose to let our power be
exploited for evil.
[Sombron]
Enough of this nonsense! I won't let you
stop me─or sway my intentions.
I have striven for this for thousands of years.
If you intend to stand in my way, you will die.
[Alear]
This is it. Prepare for battle, everyone!

ST


[Sombron]
You dare turn your blade on me? You dare interfere
with that which I have sought for so long?
Such fatal hubris. You will pay for that accordingly.
Witness how fragile your bonds really are!
[Marth]
Ngh... Ah!
[Alear]
Huh?!
[Veyle]
What's happening to them?!
[Sombron]
I am sealing off the portal back to your world. It's what
I should have done the moment you arrived here.
I fear your Emblem allies are too weak. They will be
lost in the distortion between dimensions forevermore.
[Alear]
Huh?!
[Marth]
This cannot... This cannot be the end, ...
If we must part, remember all that we have done...
[Marth]

[Alear]
Marth!
[Veyle]
The Emblems are...
[Alear]
I knew I would have to say goodbye someday,
but I thought there was time.
[Sombron]
So much for your precious Emblems. In a matter
of moments, the portal will be shut for good.
Take comfort. For I shall inflict no further harm
upon your world.
Though you will die here as I have lived─in
anguish, far from home.
[Alfred]
We can never...go home?
[Veyle]
[Diamant]
I've been ready to die from the start. Brodia,
my land, I pray you endure.
[Alfred]

[Ivy]
It seems Elusia...will never truly know me.
[Diamant]


[Timerra]
I'm sorry, Mother.
[Timerra]

[Ivy]

[Sombron]
Worry not. I have no desire to prolong your suffering.
When I am finished, not one trace of me in your world
shall remain. As though I was never there at all.
[Alear]
I'll stop you.
[Sombron]
Is that so?
[Alear]
Our fight isn't over. The portal's open. I can do this!
If I give it my all, I can summon the Emblems back to me!
Look at how far we've come. Will you fight him
at my side? Your faith in me gives me strength!

[Veyle]
Yes, Brother! I'm with you!

[Veyle]
Yes, Sister! I'm with you!
[Alear]
Veyle...
[Veyle]
I'll be with you every step of the way. I can't summon
Emblems, and I can't turn into a dragon.
But I'm a royal dragon all the same! There's
gotta be something I can do to help.
[Alear]
Yeah!
[Alfred]
We'll all be right there with you!
You've done so much for each and every one of us!
So this time, we're returning the favor!

[Alfred]
We started this journey together─now let's end
it together. May our world prosper, Divine One!

[Anna]
There's a 100 percent discount on Lady Anna's
aid services today. One time offer! No refunds!

[Bunet]
Victory will taste sweet after the bitterness of
war. Please, allow me to cook up a triumph.



[Boucheron]
I'm saving my tears for your victory speech.
Our path is so clear, even I can't get lost!


[Céline]
All flowers must bloom... For you, I will be a
gentle rain and a ray of light!

[Chloé]
This is the part of the tale when we fall to the
dark or rise to the light. Let's reach for the light!



[Citrinne]
I suppose this is a time when riches aren't much
help...but I shall pray with all my heart!

[Clanne]
You can do this! Since the day you woke up,
I always knew you'd save the world!

[Diamant]
Divine One! This is for Father...and all the
soldiers who have fallen along the way.



[Etie]
It's the final stretch of our run. If you get tired,
we'll be here to give you a push!



[Fogado]
Haha, you think we can make a comeback?
Yeah, that's what I love about you, Divine One!

[Framme]
It's the moment of truth! As one of the 33rd
Stewards of the Dragon, I've gotta help!


[Goldmary]
I'm sorry the others are dragging this out. We
both know my belief in you is already enough.

[Hortensia]
No more sadness, Divine One. I'm tired of it!
Let's get everyone through this. I believe in you!


[Ivy]
You have always been my source of strength.
Allow my faith, just this once, to be yours.


[Jade]
The final page of our story will end with
sunlight...and a victorious Divine Dragon.

[Jean]
I want us all to make it home alive. Be strong,
Divine One! I believe in you!

[Kagetsu]
This occasion is no different than any other.
My belief in you has never once wavered!

[Lapis]
You can do it, Divine One! Underdogs always
find strength when they need it most─trust me!


[Lindon]
You've brought us quite a few miracles already.
Of course I believe in you. Never doubt it.

[Louis]
Fight on, Divine One! Let us bring you and the
Emblems together once more!

[Mauvier]
Whatever faith remains in this heart, I give
to you.

[Merrin]
You are incredibly cool, Divine One. And so is
everyone here. There's no way we're losing!



[Timerra]
No getting discouraged now! Heads held high!
We believe in you, and we will win. Easy!


[Pandreo]
Divine One. Emblems. If I may offer a prayer...
May I be blessed to assist you in victory today.


[Panette]
Aw, yeah, bring it on! This is it! The final battle!
Let us go forth and annihilate the enemy!


[Rosado]
My victory drawing won't be complete without
the Emblems, Divine One. Bring 'em back to us!



[Saphir]
One last push to victory! Get those Emblems
back here so we can do this!


[Seadall]
If you have faith in the moon and stars above,
our beloved Emblems will return!


[Alcryst]
Relax

[Alcryst]
I'm worried...but you don't need my support
either way. I know you'll see us through this.


[Amber]
Use my strength, my guts, anything! I don't care
if I don't become a legend. We just have to win!



[Vander]
Divine One... Should I fall here, know I am proud
to die as your guardian knight.


[Veyle]
As your sister and fellow dragon, I'll do
whatever it takes to help you stop Papa!

[Yunaka]
I could impersonate the Emblems, but you know
it wouldn't be the same. So let's get 'em back!


[Zelkov]
Must we be so *melodramatic*? I suppose for
the Divine Dragon, I can make an exception...

ST

[Sombron]
Imbeciles. Your scrambling is both futile and pitiful.
[Alear]
Please, my friends, I need you all...one last time.
Once more, let us engage!
Shine on, Emblem of Beginnings─Marth!

[Alear]
Care for us, Emblem of Echoes─Celica!
[Marth]

[Alear]
Provide for us, Emblem of the Holy War─Sigurd!
[Celica]

[Alear]
Free us, Emblem of Genealogy─Leif!
[Sigurd]

[Alear]
Rise up, Emblem of Binding─Roy!
[Leif]


[Alear]
Sweep across, Emblem of Blazing─Lyn!
[Roy]


[Alear]
Restore calm, Emblem of the Sacred─Eirika!
[Roy]


[Alear]
Fight on, Emblem of Radiance─Ike!
[Eirika]

[Alear]
Heal us, Emblem of Dawn─Micaiah!
[Ike]

[Alear]
Reignite us, Emblem of Awakening─Lucina!
[Micaiah]

[Alear]
Bare your fangs, Emblem of Fates─Corrin!
[Lucina]

[Alear]
Teach us, Emblem of the Academy─Byleth!
[Corrin]

[Alear]
And of course, the final Emblem...
Connect us, Fire Emblem─ !
[Byleth]

[Sombron]
What...
[Alear]
We 13 Emblems stand against you, with our allies.
The future...may divide us once more.
But here and now we fight with one heart. This fight,
this moment in time, is all that matters.
[Sombron]
What nonsense. You are the flicker of an ember.
A dying light. You're nothing.
The deeper your bonds, the greater your pain when
those bonds crumble to dust.
Why invite that inevitable pain upon yourself?
Why allow such weakness to exist?
Give up and perish, foolish child of mine!
[Alear]
Yes. You see me as a child. Foolish and weak.
And maybe you're right. Maybe that's all I am.
But I am not alone! And we're stronger when we
stand together!
The breaking of bonds can hurt, but when the bond is
reforged, it comes back as strong as ever─or
stronger─and it brings an even greater hope.
If people are willing to work for it, any bond can
be brought back to life. And that's what I'll do,
every single time, for however long it takes!
You won't leave this place. Because we're going to stop you!
Get ready, Sombron! This ends now!


--- ED ---




[Alear]
We've won, Sombron.
[Sombron]
Now I will never return home. Perhaps that
is just as well.
I am tired... Tired of searching in every shadow.

[Veyle]
For...the Emblem of Foundations?
[Sombron]
I would look in sunless woods...gloomy caves...
the shade of a dead tree.
In such places, I felt my Emblem again.
Now, that is all over.
[Alear]
You chose to be alone, yet continued to look for
this Emblem. Why?
[Sombron]
Perhaps I wanted someone to appreciate how
far I had come, all on my own.
Someone to see me─who I am─after millennia
of being cast away.
[Alear]
I could have been that person. Or Veyle, or our
siblings. Why didn't you let us?
Why choose to start these wars?
[Sombron]
Ack... I need no connections. Not in your world.
[Alear]
Even at the end, you don't want to be a father
to us. Very well.
You'll be only the Fell Dragon─an evil that
we slayed. That's how we'll remember you.
[Sombron]
Do as you please. I have been alone for all this
time. Why should my death be different?
I do not need mercy or pity. I will fade in this
place, apart from the one I yearn to see.
[Alear]
Do you remember the invocation?
[Sombron]
What?
[Alear]
The invocation for the Emblem of Foundations.
[Sombron]
I have tried. Again and again I said the words.
It was no use.
[Alear]
Still...it couldn't hurt to try. One last time.
[Sombron]
All right... Burn...
Burn us, Emblem of Foundations.
[Alear]
...
[Sombron]
Oh! This light! Oh...at last...
At last, we meet again...
[Veyle]
Papa? I...I don't see anyone...
[Alear]
I don't either. It must be someone only he
can see.
An old friend. The one person he truly let in.
[Sombron]
You and I... Let us be on our way...once more.
Engage...
[Sombron]

[Veyle]
Papa...
[Alear]
He's gone. And the ring for the Emblem of
Foundations... That's gone with him.
Our fight is over. Let's go home.
It's time to shut this portal once and for all.




[Alear]
The portal is closing.
Once it's shut, the war ends, and balance
returns to the world.
[Marth]
We did it, .
Haha!
[Alear]
Oh...
It's really time to say goodbye.
[Marth]
This was a wonderful journey. Thank you for
letting us share it with you, .
[Alear]
No, thank you, Marth.
I'm so sad to see you go. But it's time to
stand tall and say goodbye.
Thank you for keeping your promise. You really
were my ally─my friend─through it all.
I just hope I'll be strong enough for whatever
lies ahead.
[Marth]
You will be. You're already much stronger than
a thousand years ago or the day you awakened.
I know you'll carry on the Emblems' legacy...
and your mother's.
We will not be here to help you anymore.
Now it's your turn to help others. As the
Divine Dragon and as an Emblem.
[Alear]
I will.

[Veyle]
You're not doing this alone. We'll be there to
support you, Brother.

[Veyle]
You're not doing this alone. We'll be there to
support you, Sister.
[Veyle]
[Alfred]
We can't replace Marth and the others,
but we'll do what we can.
[Alfred]

[Ivy]
Yes. Please don't worry... It's no good. Here
come the tears.
[Ivy]
[Diamant]
Ngh... I wish we didn't have to lose you.
[Diamant]


[Timerra]
We were just getting to know you, and now...
goodbye forever?
[Marth]


[Sigurd]
Please do not cry.
[Alear]
But...
[Sigurd]
This world's burdens are yours to shoulder.
Meet them proudly.
You should not always hold back tears, but
please, for now, try to.
[Marth]
I agree. I'd like for us to part with smiles
on our faces.
That's how I want us to remember each other.
In joy, not sorrow.
[Alear]
Me too.


[Byleth]
It seems this is goodbye, but we'll never bid
farewell to what we learned together.

[Corrin]
I'll miss you...but I know you'll choose the right
paths to walk.

[Lucina]
We'll always be together in spirit, no matter
the distance. Build a bright future.

[Micaiah]
Don't worry. I can see that your lives will be
filled with hope and happiness.

[Ike]
Go out and create a better world. I know
you can... I know you will.


[Eirika]
I will be praying for you─praying that your
world is filled with kindness and laughter.

[Lyn]
Wherever you go, may the blessings of
Mother Earth and Father Sky follow.

[Roy]
I'm glad to have known you. I hope you make
an Arcadia of this land.

[Leif]
If your nations band together, there is no
hardship you cannot overcome.


[Sigurd]
Know love as well as grief. Honor your bonds,
carry the light, and nothing will be impossible.

[Celica]
Lead with compassion, Divine One. And may
your happiness be eternal.



[Marth]
This is the moment.
[Alear]
So it is.
[Marth]
Thank you, . You are a member
of our family─the Emblem who connects us all.
If ever we cross paths again... No. When we
cross paths again...
I hope that you will remember us. We, who
existed together for this time.
The 13 Emblems.
[Alear]
Of course I'll remember you. Everything about
you, and all the times we shared.
Even when we're apart, we'll always
be connected.
Thank you for standing with me until the
very end.
[Marth]
Hah.
[Marth]

[Alear]
Goodbye, Emblems... My family.
You gave me courage, strength, and inspiration.
I will follow your example.
Always. I promise.
Let's go back home, everyone. Back to Elyos.

You thought I sat idly, waiting for you to arrive?
I could not bring back my Emblem, but I

Dark Emblems, who once plunged their
worlds into despair.

[Alear]
Dark Emblems?
[Alear]
[Marth]
That presence... So familiar... Yes. These are
the foes we fought in our original forms.
Perhaps we should match each Emblem to their
own enemy. But I can't sense who is who.
We should move closer. With caution.

Today's the day of my coronation. Today I'll
be crowned the Divine Dragon King.
Today's the day of my coronation. Today I'll
be crowned the Divine Dragon Queen.
I had hoped that all of you would be standing by
my side for the occasion.
But I guess not.
Shine on, Emblem of Beginnings!
Worth a try.
I wonder if we'll ever meet again...
Aha! I knew we'd find you in here!
We must've looked everywhere.
Everyone...
The coronation is going to start any minute now.
All right. Time to get changed. Unless you're
wearing that.
Yeah, I guess I should, huh?
Well, hurry up! Come on!
Whoa, OK! I'm coming, I'm coming!
Someday, in the future...
Our paths may cross once more.
Our bonds can be reforged time and again, whenever
you desire. You need only say the word.
Engage!

[Alear]
What happened?
[Sombron]
Everyone you care about...they are all dead.
[Veyle]
Dear brother. It's time to go.
[Veyle]
Dear sister. It's time to go.
[Sombron]
Hahahahaha!


--- BT ---


[Sigurd]
The divine sword Tyrfing is awakened.
That marks you as─ No. Impossible.
As a knight of Grannvale, and a descendant of
one of the 12 crusaders, I shall be your end!

[Celica]
We meet again, Duma...though I'm not sure you
are him.
Please, do no more harm. Allow your great and
weary soul the rest it deserves...

[Micaiah]
You?! Has Sombron summoned you again to
pass judgment on the world?
I'm not going to let that happen! Yune...please
give me strength!

[Roy]
Why are you here─and in that form? We have
no quarrel.
So...I'll do my part to stop this. And I'll again
free your soul from endless fighting.

[Leif]
You radiate evil...but are you truly the dark
bishop who I fought once before?
Is your intent to spread fear and despair in this
world too? I will never allow that to happen!

[Lucina]
You've come chasing after me again. You, who
are the wings of despair and the breath of ruin...
If that's so, then I challenge that fate! Die now,
that our future can live!

[Lyn]
Fate is full of surprises. Who would have
thought we'd meet again?
Yet this, I'm afraid, is our final parting. Soon
you'll only be a stain on my sword!

[Ike]
I know exactly who you are. I can feel it.
You're the Mad King.
I won't hold back against you! I'll fight with all
my strength!

[Byleth]
The King of Liberation, revived? I doubt you'll
go peacefully. Well, neither will I.
The flow of time may have brought us both
here, but now I will end your journey.

[Corrin]
I didn't want to see you... But if it's true that

Then I will stop you every time. I won't give up!

You fought so hard, traveled so far, merely
to die?


[Eirika]
I sense a miasma of evil coming from you...
Could you be the Demon King?
If you are, I will defeat you before you beguile
anyone or cause a tragedy.

You are pathetic.
As if spurning me to be a Divine Dragon was
not enough... Patricide? Unforgivable.

You killed your own children─tried to destroy
the world─for your selfish desires.
You're the one who is beyond forgiveness.

I said your world meant nothing to me.
Its people, my children...you.
Once I leave, I will forget you. Even if we
met again, I would not recall your face.

In other words, you'll make the same mistakes
as before. So which of us is pathetic?

Oh, the defect. I thought myself rid of you, yet
here you are.

[Veyle]
Heh.

You laugh.
[Veyle]
You're angry because I persisted and survived.
It almost feels like praise.
We never spent time together as father and
daughter, like I wanted.
But I'm glad I didn't give up. I made it. Because
now, I can be the one who defeats you.

You are a malicious child. I would expect no
less from my own.

I hope you're watching, Mama. I'm going to
stop him─just like you told me.

I've defeated you before, and I will again, for I
hold the Exalted Falchion!
