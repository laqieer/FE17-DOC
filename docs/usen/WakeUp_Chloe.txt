Hehehe! You sleep so peacefully.


I can scarcely believe...
you slept this way for a thousand years. You 
look so young and innocent.
It makes me feel a certain sense of 
protectiveness toward you.


Good morning.
How are you today?
Just let me know...
if there's anything you need, all right?


Good morning, Divine One.
Need some more rest?
Want me to fluff your pillow?


--- C2 ---

Goodness, what a view. Like something out of 
a dream...


I came here to wake you up, and I didn't even 
bring breakfast. How thoughtless of me!
Maybe I have some snacks...
Let's see... Hmm, I guess this folk food will have 
to do.


Hey, Divine One! What would you say to an 
interesting breakfast?
We've got fried fish heads, offal, and...
No? Are you sure?


Good morning.
The scenery here is completely captivating.
It's like you sleep inside a painting.

I get to wake the Divine Dragon!
This is so exciting!


It's almost like the stories.
A magical slumber...
that can only be broken...
by the right one stealing in, and...
Well, me being the right one for that is a bit of 
a stretch, I'm sure.


Morning, Divine One.
Today promises to be another beautiful day.
So get out there and make the most of it!


Aw, you're up.
I was excited to come in and wake you, but it 
was all over so quickly...
Slow down next time, OK?


--- B2 ---

I feel such solemnity approaching this place. 
The Divine Dragon is a special figure...


I still feel bad about before.
And since you didn't want that pickled fish 
I offered you...
I decided to get you another special treat. I hope 
you'll like this one.


Good morning.
I brought you some honey-glazed caterpillar! 
Sweet, crunchy, and delicious!
There's no need to panic, Divine One! It's 
perfectly safe! Go on, give it a try!


Oh, you heard all that?
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable.
If it helps, you wake up just like everyone else!


--- A1 ---

Sorry I'm late! I got distracted shopping for 
these snacks...


Mmm, they smell amazing.
I've been waiting ages to try charred snake. 
I never thought I'd get my hands on some.
Maybe I'll sneak just one bite...
No, I should wait for the Divine Dragon... 
Ooo, I don't know if I can...


Oh, uh, Divine One! Good morning!
Excuse me.
Good morning, Divine One.
Eating? No, I wasn't eating anything.


Rousing aroma, isn't it?
This charred meat is a rare delicacy.
No, I'm not going to tell you what it is! Haha, 
try it first!

If your story became a fairy tale...
it would start here in this room.


Someday they'll tell stories about this war.
When that day comes...
you'll be a legend, Divine One.
That's a future I'm excited to look forward to.


Good morning. I promise I haven't just been 
staring at you.
I was thinking ahead to a future when everyone 
knows your story.
Let's make it an amazing one, OK?


The book that tells your story would have an 
illustration of you sleeping, I'm sure.
And the one who came to wake you in 
the morning...
Well, it probably wouldn't be me.


--- S1 ---

Ready to turn the page on a new day in 
our story?


Still peacefully asleep.
If this were a fairy tale, I'd have to break a 
magic spell to wake you up.
Hehe, I guess it's good that it's not, since 
I wouldn't have the first idea where to start.
But even if our lives aren't actually all 
that storybook...
I'm glad to live mine alongside you.
And just like in all the best stories, I think we'll 
live happily ever after.


Morning. Before we head out, why don't we 
spend some time together?
We can forget all about this war business...
and just relax and be happy for a while.


Oh, you got up quickly!
I'm glad to see you're as excited to start the 
day as I am.
No need to rush, though. Why don't we stay in 
and chat a while first?


--- S2 ---

Your sleeping face is as charming as ever.


When I became a knight...
I didn't think my life could possibly get any 
more exciting.
But then our paths crossed, and I found myself 
wrapped up in this incredible story.
A story that I'll now be a part of as it's passed 
down to future generations.
That's why I'm going to stay with you to the 
very end of it.
So even after I pass on, you'll always be able to 
see me in a storybook.


Good morning.
Let's keep scenes like this one out of the books.
I want the quiet moments we share together...
to stay purely between us.


Has my coming here to wake you become 
an ordinary part of your life? Hehe!
No matter how commonplace the days may be...
for me, every moment I spend with you 
feels extraordinary.
