[Panette] 
Goldmary, I hear you are quite the chef.
[Goldmary] 
I certainly am.
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry to say, to the chagrin of all lesser 
cooks, my talent in the kitchen has no equal.
[Goldmary] 
I feel the envy of others weighing heavily on me, 
but I suppose that is the price of greatness.
[Panette] 
Marvelous! Well then, being such an expert, 
might you be willing to teach me?
[Goldmary] 
Maybe. Why?
[Panette] 
To my great shame, I know nothing of the 
culinary arts.
[Panette] 
As a servant of the royal family, I ought to have 
some facility in the kitchen. Don't you think?
[Goldmary] 
Naturally...
[Goldmary] 
But giving you my culinary secrets would mean 
more competition for me.
[Panette] 
I assure you, I do not wish to steal your thunder. 
All I want is to please the boss.
[Goldmary] 
If it's purely for the crown princess...
[Goldmary] 
All right. Out of respect for your devotion, 
I'll do it.
[Goldmary] 
I will gather up the ingredients. Be ready to get 
started next time we meet.
[Panette] 
Thank you! I will not forget this kindness.

[Goldmary] 
Time to begin our cooking lesson, Panette. 
We are going to roast a chicken.
[Panette] 
Marvelous. The boss is quite partial to 
fowl concoctions.
[Goldmary] 
I'm...not sure that phrasing makes sense to me, 
but all right. Here is what we're working with.
[Panette] 
Mm-hmm, I see.
[Panette] 
So this bird has been roasted and is ready to 
serve, correct?
[Goldmary] 
What? Of course not. It's absolutely raw.
[Goldmary] 
First, we'll put in some stuffing, and then we'll 
roast it. Over fire.
[Panette] 
Oh, mm-hmm. I see, I see.
[Goldmary] 
We'll use these vegetables for our stuffing. 
Would you chop them into fine pieces for us?
[Panette] 
With gusto!
[Goldmary] 
They're only vegetables, Panette... They don't 
fight back.
[Panette] 
Here comes the finishing strike! Hiya!
[Goldmary] 
Well, I'd say you've chopped them into 
complete submission.
[Panette] 
Why, thank you, Miss Goldmary! I am happy to 
chop further, if need be.
[Goldmary] 
No, you've been...very thorough. If you chop 
them anymore, we'll be having soup.
[Goldmary] 
We should also not be seasoning with splinters 
from the cutting board, but...we'll let that go.
[Goldmary] 
Now, let's stuff the chicken with the veggies, 
put it on a skewer, and roast it up nicely.
[Panette] 
Teacher, teacher! I have a question.
[Goldmary] 
Yes?
[Panette] 
Is it ready yet?
[Goldmary] 
Uh, we only just put it on the fire...

[Panette] 
Thank you ever so much for the cooking 
lesson, Goldmary!
[Panette] 
I later made a chicken roast for the boss, 
following your steps to the letter.
[Panette] 
She was over the moon, I say! Could not stop 
singing the dish's praises.
[Goldmary] 
I'm so glad.
[Goldmary] 
Could it be that teaching is yet another entry in 
my absurdly long list of talents?
[Goldmary] 
I-I'm sorry if the pristine quality of my lesson 
presented a distraction for you while cooking.
[Panette] 
Ah, no, but there was one issue. The boss did 
appear to be in some pain as she ate.
[Goldmary] 
That's worrisome.
[Panette] 
Yes. There was something hard in the chicken 
that ground against her teeth. Gristle, perhaps?
[Goldmary] 
Or a chunk of the cutting board.
[Goldmary] 
You really must learn to be more careful with 
the chopping.
[Panette] 
Understood!
[Goldmary] 
Despite that, I think my cooking course was 
quite successful. Wouldn't you agree?
[Panette] 
Indeed, it was a rousing success! Thank you for 
your assistance, my teacher.
[Panette] 
In fact, thanks to your tutelage, I have already 
received my first cooking assignment.
[Goldmary] 
You've been given work? As a chef?
[Panette] 
The boss found my way of chopping ingredients 
rather charming, you see.
[Panette] 
So, when the war is over, she will invite some 
luminaries for a demonstration at Solm Palace.
[Goldmary] 
A demonstration in the palace? For the whole 
court of the queendom?!
[Panette] 
I know! Isn't it wonderful? I will be sure to tell 
them that it was you who taught me all I know.
[Goldmary] 
Th-th-that's a bit... Uh, well...
[Goldmary] 
There are bound to be serious individuals even 
in a relaxed court like Solm...
[Goldmary] 
So I suppose I'd better help make sure your 
chopping skill is up to the task.
[Panette] 
What?! I thought our lessons were finished!
[Goldmary] 
If my name is on this, we will do it right. Shall 
I tell Princess Timerra that you refused lessons?
[Panette] 
Aw...
[Goldmary] 
Shouldn't you be grateful to have individual 
instruction from such a gifted teacher?
[Panette] 
Yes, Miss Goldmary.
