[Jean]
...
[Jean]
It's no use. I'm so tired that none of this
is registering.
[Lindon]
Is there a problem, lad?
[Jean]
Hello, sir. I was just trying to get through
this book.
[Lindon]
Reading at this late hour, are you? I admire
your determination. What are you studying?
[Jean]
Medicine.
[Lindon]
Hmm... You look tired. It must be hard to focus
so late at night.
[Jean]
I know I haven't gotten much sleep, but there's
just so much to memorize.
[Lindon]
Battles by day, studies by night... The candle
that burns at both ends doesn't last long, lad.
[Lindon]
You'll wear out your own body long before
you learn to care for anyone else's.
[Jean]
I know you're right. It's just...
[Lindon]
You'd be better served closing those books for
now and giving yourself a change of pace.
[Jean]
But I still have so much to learn!
[Lindon]
Books are wonderful teachers, lad, but there
are lessons they can't impart.
[Lindon]
It might be time you looked somewhere else
to learn a thing or two.
[Lindon]
Do that, and you might find that you'll get more
out of your books when you return to them.
[Jean]
You really think that's true?
[Lindon]
I do indeed. Give me a few days, and I'll see
about setting up a lesson for you.

[Lindon]
Here we are, Jean. Your new classroom.
[Jean]
A meadow?
[Jean]
Why are we here? I don't see anyone who
could teach me anything.
[Lindon]
Look harder, then.
[Jean]
Um...where?
[Lindon]
The flowers blooming all around us. They'll be
your teachers for today.
[Jean]
Heh, you're kidding, right, sir?
[Lindon]
Oh, not at all. I'm very serious.
[Lindon]
You've exhausted yourself, lad, both physically
and mentally.
[Lindon]
Nothing you could read in a book right now will
teach you as much as these flowers can.
[Lindon]
Humor me and take a seat at my side.
[Jean]
OK... If you say so.
[Lindon]
Now lie back slowly and look up at the sky.
Then take a long, deep breath.
[Jean]
OK...
[Jean]
Like that?
[Lindon]
My goodness, do you hear that? The flowers
are whispering to you.
[Jean]
They are?
[Jean]
I don't hear anything.
[Lindon]
Hmm. Try relaxing your shoulders more and
turning your ears toward them.
[Jean]
Um...
[Jean]
I still don't hear anything.
[Jean]
They smell good, though. And there's a nice
breeze in the air.
[Lindon]
Is that so? Then maybe you should take it all
in more fully.
[Jean]
I'll do just that...
[Jean]
...
[Jean]
...
[Lindon]
Asleep at last. And about time too.

[Jean]
Sir, I'm sorry I was so rude last time. I didn't
mean to fall asleep in the middle of a lesson.
[Lindon]
You have nothing to apologize for. Getting you
some rest was the whole point.
[Lindon]
Although there was a lesson to be learned
there from the flowers.
[Jean]
There was?
[Lindon]
Don't be in such a hurry that you neglect to
take rests. You'll miss the forest for the trees.
[Jean]
Aw...
[Jean]
I admit, I did have an easier time concentrating
on that book once I got home from the meadow.
[Lindon]
Aha! Glad to hear it.
[Jean]
Sir? Would you do me the honor of taking me
on as a student?
[Lindon]
Who, me?
[Jean]
I learned a lot from that lesson.
[Jean]
I need more than books. It would be better if I
had a whole range of knowledge and expertise.
[Jean]
That's the kind of thing a master sage like you
could offer.
[Lindon]
Hm-hm, a master sage, huh?!
[Jean]
Should I not call you that?
[Lindon]
No, no. The title is fine. It's just...
[Lindon]
I have a lot to teach, and I'm getting on in years.
I might end before my curriculum does.
[Jean]
I wouldn't worry too much about that.
[Jean]
I'm still learning, but as your doctor, I'll see to
it that you stay in good health.
[Lindon]
Hm-hm, so that's the deal, eh? Well played,
well played.
[Lindon]
I accept, then. From now on, consider yourself
my student.
[Jean]
Thank you, sir! I'll make you proud!
