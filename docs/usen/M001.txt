[Alear]
...
Where am I?

[Framme]
Huh?
[Clanne]
Whoa. Tell me you're seeing this!
[Alear]
Hello there. And you are?
[Framme]
You're awake!
[Alear]
Huh?
[Framme]
You're really awake, yeah?
[Clanne]
You're the Divine Dragon !
[Alear]
Uh...
[Framme]
No way!
[Clanne]
No way!
[Clanne]
The Divine Dragon is finally awake!
[Framme]
[Clanne]

[Alear]
Hey, hold on!



[Vander]
Calm down, calm down, you two. What's all of
this ruckus about?


[Alear]
Uh... Huh?
[Vander]
Divine Dragon !
It's a miracle. An utter miracle. The Divine One,
awake at long last...
That I might live to see you standing before me.
What an honor.
[Alear]
Um, not to be rude, but...who are you?
[Vander]
Ah! Apologies. I lost myself for a moment there.
My name is Vander. I am the 32nd Steward of
the Dragon.
[Alear]
Hello, Sir Vander.
[Vander]
Oh my, Divine One! There is no need to address
me as such. Simply "Vander" will do.
[Framme]
See! I told you the Divine Dragon was awake!
[Clanne]
Yeah! We were telling the truth!
[Alear]
You two. I don't believe I got your names.
[Clanne]
Oh, sorry! We were so excited we forgot to
introduce ourselves.
We're the 33rd Stewards of the Dragon!
My name's Clanne. Pleased to meet you.
[Framme]
And I'm Framme! We're twins.
We've been waiting forever for you to wake up!
[Vander]
As Stewards of the Dragon, our mission is to
protect and provide for you.
Generation after generation of our predecessors
waited for you to rise from your slumber.
I'll admit, I am astonished to see it has
finally happened.
You see, a thousand years have passed since
the first steward took their post.
[Alear]
A thousand years? That's how long I've
been asleep?
[Vander]
Indeed. Your mother─Lumera, the Divine
Dragon Monarch─has long awaited this day.
Finally you, a Divine Dragon yourself, have
awakened. This surely signifies great things.
[Alear]
Slow down. This monarch you mentioned─
she's my mother?
And I'm a "Divine Dragon," you called it?
[Vander]
Oh dear. Is your memory hazy, Divine One?
[Alear]
I know my name, but...that's about it.
[Clanne]
You can't remember anything else?
[Framme]
Maybe you're just feeling groggy 'cause of
all that sleep?
[Alear]
But I don't even know who I am.
[Vander]
Fret not. Such lapses in memory are to be
expected after sleeping for so long.
If I may... You are a Divine Dragon, a member of
a royal family of dragons revered as deities.
Queen Lumera, the Divine Dragon Monarch,
rules over the Holy Land of Lythos.
In the war a thousand years ago, she defeated
and imprisoned the wicked Fell Dragon.
You, Divine One, are her only child.
[Alear]
The war, the Fell Dragon... I feel like I can
almost remember, but...
[Vander]
Please, do not trouble yourself trying to bring it
all back at once.
Your memories will return in time. You are
a being of immense power─a deity, no less.
I have heard many a tale of your kindness,
nobility, and bravery. Your unflinching heroism.
[Alear]
That's a lot to live up to.
[Vander]
For now, let us head to Lythos Castle. Queen
Lumera will be thrilled to see you.
Perhaps the reunion will help stir
your memories.
[Alear]
I hope so.
[Clanne]
OK, then! Onward and downward!
[Framme]
To Lythos Castle!

Raaargh!
Huh?!
Wh-what are those horrible things?!
Vander! Are creatures like that common
around here?
They're not. I've never seen them.
Nor have I heard of such monsters appearing in
Lythos before. This is a land of peace.
Understood. Well...
Shall we fight them?
As you wish, Divine One! You whose bravery
knows no equal.
No. Let's run.
Huh?
We haven't the slightest idea who they are.
And we don't know how they came to be here.
Also... They worry me for some reason.
So, we run!
I, er, well... Did the Divine Dragon really
command me to retreat?
OK! Get to safety!
We'll keep them distracted for you!
What the─ Come back! Come back this instant!
Raaargh!
Ah! Oh no!
Uh, this isn't looking good...
Clanne! Framme!
Hold on! We shall come to you!




[Alear]
All this time, I've been sleeping in the sky?
[Vander]
You have, yes. The place where you slumbered
is known as the Somniel.
A fortress built upon an airborne island to
ensure your safety.
It is perhaps the most secure place in all of
Elyos. Only a select few can set foot there.
[Alear]
I see. And you three live there with me?
[Framme]
Yup! As stewards, we spend our time caring for
you and managing things around the Somniel.
It's a sacred place, so we work as hard as we
can to keep it shipshape!
[Clanne]
Royal family members visit us all the time!
Well, visit you, really.
The prince and princess of Firene─a deeply
religious country─visit especially often.
[Framme]
They pray next to you, like this. Then they just...
talk for a while, like they're chatting to a friend.
[Alear]
I see. Thanks for filling me in, Framme.
You too, Clanne.
[Framme]
Ah! The Divine One said our names! And
thanked us!
[Clanne]
I think I'm going to faint...unless I already did.
Am I dreaming?
[Vander]
Need I remind you that you are in the presence
of the Divine Dragon!
How many times must I tell you to behave in a
manner befitting your station?
Divine One, please forgive this embarrassing
breach of decorum.
[Alear]
Breach of decorum? Haha, I'm actually enjoying
their enthusiasm.
[Framme]
Hehe! You're just as kindhearted as I always
imagined!
[Clanne]
Oh, look, there it is!
[Alear]
Lythos Castle. The...Divine Dragon Monarch is
there, you said?
[Vander]
Yes. I suppose a thousand years have passed
since you've been home.
[Framme]
Don't worry. We'll be right there with you.
[Clanne]
You can hold my hand if you like.
[Alear]
Thank you.
Hm?
How long have I been wearing this ring? Since
before I fell asleep?
That blue stone... It reminds me of something...

[Framme]
Divine One! Vander! Thanks for saving us.
[Clanne]
Yeah. And, uh...sorry. This all happened because
we ran ahead.
[Alear]
I'm the one who should apologize. You put
yourselves in danger trying to protect me.
It's such a relief you're both safe now...
[Vander]
Divine One, I hear more enemies approaching.
[Alear]
More? I thought we'd gotten them all.
[Vander]
Evidently not.
These creatures... Will there be no end to them?




[Lumera]
Is it really you, ?
[Alear]
Yes, it's me. Thank you for saving us.
[Lumera]
What a joy it is to see you, .
[Alear]
Huh?
[Lumera]
I've waited for so long!
[Alear]
Oh!
[Lumera]
When I sensed you had awoken, I flew here as
fast as my wings would carry me.
I hope you're not hurt.
[Alear]
I'm... I'm fine.
[Lumera]
What a relief! You cannot understand how I've
missed you, my dear child.
[Alear]
Oh! You're...my mother.
[Lumera]
What's the matter? Don't tell me...

[Vander]
Since awakening, the Divine One's memory
is clouded.
[Lumera]
Oh! I see.
[Alear]
I'm sorry. I'm sure you weren't expecting this.
[Lumera]
No, I must apologize. I was so overcome
with joy, I hugged you as hard as I could.
I take this to mean you've forgotten...everything.
I suppose it's to be expected. A thousand years
is a very long time.
[Alear]
Vander explained that I've been sleeping since...
since some war that happened back then.
[Lumera]
Yes. You suffered a terrible wound. And...
and because of that...
[Alear]
A wound? I don't remember that. Or this world,
or anything.
[Lumera]
Don't fret, young one. I will speak to you of all
you've forgotten.
Regardless of what you remember, I'm simply
glad to have you back, my dear child.
[Alear]
Still...this isn't the reunion you hoped for.
[Lumera]
Oh, don't worry about me. It's solace enough
just to hear that sweet voice of yours!
And to gaze once more into your eyes.
What lovely colors they are, .

[Alear]
The ring...
[Marth] 0
[Marth]
Know that my strength can be yours.
[Alear]
I know that voice.
[Marth]
If ever we cross paths again, I hope you will
remember me.
Indeed, that you will remember all of us who
took up arms to fight by your side.
[Marth]

[Alear]
The 12 Emblems...


[Vander]
Divine One?
[Alear]
[Vander]
Divine One! You mustn't do this alone!
[Alear]
Don't worry! Please! I'm not alone!
Help me. Lend me your strength in this fight!
Shine on, Emblem of Beginnings!

Default


[Framme]
That was amazing!
[Clanne]
Cool!
[Clanne]
[Framme]


[Alear]
We did it!
Thanks for your help, Marth, truly!

[Marth]
Of course. It is good to see you.
I was able to answer your call, because you
remembered me.
[Marth]



[Vander]
Do my eyes deceive me...or is that an Emblem
of legend?
[Vander]

[Alear]
Clanne! Framme! Get to safety, now!

[Clanne]
Uh, right!


[Alear]
With your help, Marth, we might just make it.
Will you join us?
[Marth]
Relax
[Marth]
Of course. I will fight alongside you from here
forward─your ally, until the very end.


[Alear]
Vander!


[Vander]
Divine One! Stay back─it's too dangerous!
[Alear]
Clanne and Framme were trying to protect me.
I have to help them.
I take back what I said─this is no time to run.
Please, let me fight.

[Vander]
All right... But stay on your guard.
[Alear]
I will.



[Vander]
What are these creatures doing in Lythos?



[Vander]
We had best use the foliage to take cover.



[Vander]
Are you wounded, Divine One? Please use
a vulnerary.



[Vander]
These enemies are formidable indeed...
Divine One, please use a vulnerary if you
are wounded!

[Framme]
There are too many of them... Divine One,
get outta here!

[Framme]
...
[Clanne]
Framme, are you all right?!
[Framme]
[Clanne]



[Vander]
Clanne, Framme, it's not safe for you here!
Retreat to the castle!

[Clanne]
I gotta protect Framme... You rotten monsters
don't scare me!



[Vander]
More enemies!

[Alear]
They just keep coming.
You're all trying to protect me.
I should be protecting you! If only I could...
somehow.
[Vander]
" [Marth]
[Marth]
...

[Alear]
Huh?
[Marth]
[Marth]
You must remember, ...
[Alear]
Who... Who said that?


--- MOVIE ---

[Marth]
I am known as Marth. Emblem Marth, to be clear.

[Alear]
There's more?
[Alear]
And they've got a dragon?!
[Alear]
AH!
[Lumera]
At last. You are awake.

[Lumera]
We live on the continent of Elyos. Four realms
surrounding a holy land at its center.
Firene, Kingdom of Abundance.
Brodia, Kingdom of Might.
Elusia, Kingdom of Knowledge.
Solm, Queendom of Freedom.
The Land of Lythos, home of Divine Dragons.
And Gradlon, domain of the Fell Dragon. Fallen to ruin.
A thousand years ago, our lands endured a
vicious war with the Fell Dragon.
We called upon heroes from other worlds to
aid us. Heroes known as Emblems.
With them, the warriors of our nations fought as one.
In the end, we were victorious in defeating
and imprisoning the Fell Dragon.
In the years since, our world has been safe.
But now, I sense a resurrection. The binding weakens.
If his shadow stretches across the land again, then
we must fight him anew, as we did in ages past.
Fell Dragon Sombron must be stopped.
