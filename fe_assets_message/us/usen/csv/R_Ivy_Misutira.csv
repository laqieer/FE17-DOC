[Ivy] 
Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Ivy] 
Camping was a valuable life experience. 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
You're welcome! So tell me..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
Did you find any weaknesses?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Ivy] 
Heh, you saw right through me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Timerra] 
Of course. I'm a princess too, aren't I? I was 
thinking the same thing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Timerra] 
One day, when we're queens, knowing one 
another's weaknesses could give us an edge."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Ivy] 
That is indeed why I decided to go along."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Ivy] 
In the end, however, the only weakness revealed 
was my own."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Timerra] 
Yup! Starts with G and rhymes with roasts."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Ivy] 
And all I learned about you is that we are even 
less alike than I'd supposed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Ivy] 
I am left with only a longer list of ways in which 
we're opposites."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Ivy] 
You like meat. I prefer vegetables."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Timerra] 
I love singing, but you're shy about doing it in 
front of other people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Ivy] 
I prefer to spend my time in study. You would 
rather spend it running through the hills."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Timerra] 
Hehe, we really are opposites, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Ivy] 
Yes. But despite that, I did appreciate our 
time together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Timerra] 
Same, honestly. I had a great time!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Ivy] 
Differences can be a source of conflict, but they 
can also elevate discussion."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Ivy] 
I believe our conversations will ultimately make 
me a better leader to my people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Timerra] 
Me too. I hope we can keep being friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Ivy] 
Friendship is based on reciprocity. You owe me 
one weakness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Timerra] 
Hm. Hate to do it, but I guess you've painted 
me into a corner."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Ivy] 
Heh heh, I jest. I would like us to be on good 
terms, Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Ivy] 
Let our friendship set the standard for the 
relations between our countries."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Timerra] 
Agreed. Here's to a long, ghost-free friendship!"

..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Timerra] 
♪Hmm hm-hm-hm! Hm-hm hmm!♪"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Timerra] 
See, Princess Ivy? I knew you'd have fun!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Ivy] 
With all due respect, Your Highness, your 
powers of observation...need work."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Ivy] 
Look at me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Ivy] 
I'm in the presence of foreign royalty, yet I can't 
master myself enough to stop shaking."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Ivy] 
I am─to vastly understate the matter─not 
enjoying this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Timerra] 
Oh, whoa, you are shaking. Are you cold? 
I can throw more logs on the fire."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Ivy] 
No...it is not the cold."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Ivy] 
Aah!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Ivy] 
I am shaking because I am afraid."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Timerra] 
Oh! If it's wild animals you're worried about, 
let me put those fears to rest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Timerra] 
I set up a few traps just in case, but the fire 
should be enough to keep them away."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Ivy] 
No. Ghosts."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Ivy] 
I'm certain I heard a strange moaning cry... 
coming from that way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Timerra] 
♪Hey, you spooky ghost! How's it going?!♪"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Ivy] 
Aah! Quiet!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Timerra] 
Hehe! Sorry, sorry. But singing might make 
you feel a little less scared. Why not try it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Ivy] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Ivy] 
♪Ghoooost...♪"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Timerra] 
That's it! Now... ♪Of all the things to be scared 
of, why ghosts and not plagues or wars?♪"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Ivy] 
♪Please just forget what you saw here... 
I've had enough sleeping outdoors. ♪"

[Timerra] 
Heya, Princess Ivy!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Ivy] 
Hello, Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Timerra] 
Look at us, huh? Two future queens, hanging 
out together like this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Ivy] 
True. I will rule Elusia one day─and you Solm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Ivy] 
Beyond our royal status, however, we appear to 
have nothing in common."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Timerra] 
I don't know if we're all that different."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Ivy] 
No? It seems to me that our appearances and 
personalities are direct opposites."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
Not to suggest either is superior, of course. 
But the differences are plain enough to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Timerra] 
Hmm, I guess you have a point."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Ivy] 
I've never roamed my territory fighting bandits, 
for instance. I've never even been camping."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Timerra] 
What?! You've never been camping?! 
Then you've never really lived!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Ivy] 
Walls and doors were built for a reason. I see 
little point in sleeping outside of them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Timerra] 
You'll change your tune once you experience 
the thrill of sleeping under the stars for yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Ivy] 
Why would I..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Ivy] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Ivy] 
You know what? OK."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Ivy] 
It would be rude of me to refuse an invitation 
from a fellow princess. I accept."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Timerra] 
Wahoo! I'll start preparing for the big day. 
Get ready to have the time of your life!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Ivy] 
It does promise to be interesting."
