[Yunaka] 
Hear that? Could be more bandits."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Panette] 
Oh? You goons back for seconds?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Panette] 
Ha! Ain't often I meet bandits who whine like 
kitty cats!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
Oh, no no no, hold up. That actually was a cat. 
Tricksy little hairball set me on edge!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Panette] 
Oh! Right you are. What a relief!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Panette] 
I must say, Yunaka, I rather enjoy that vicious 
demeanor you adopt during combat."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Yunaka] 
I could say the same about you! You're usually 
so polite, but you really let 'em have it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Panette] 
Yes. In moments of danger, I sometimes feel my 
blood boil as it used to."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Yunaka] 
I know the feeling. I slip into my old ways 
sometimes too. As you saw."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Yunaka] 
We do have a lot in common, don't we? But... 
Let's keep this our little secret."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Panette] 
Indeed. Which reminds me... I apologize for 
needling you about the way you speak."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Panette] 
Really, it was quite conceited of me. Glass 
houses and all that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Yunaka] 
I get it. Some good came out of it, though. 
I learned my act needs work, for one thing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Panette] 
We could practice together, perhaps?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Yunaka] 
Zappy! Great idea!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Panette] 
Um, you know, I have always meant to ask..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Panette] 
What is this ""zappy"" business all about?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Yunaka] 
Oh. Well, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Panette] 
Yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Yunaka] 
That's another one of my mysteries! Wouldn't 
wanna spoil it until we know each other better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Panette] 
Ah! In that case, you give me no choice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Panette] 
I shall see to it that we become the very best 
of friends!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 

[Panette] 
Yunaka, I cannot help but wonder about 
your past."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Panette] 
I understand wanting to preserve some secrecy. 
But please...tell me a little about it, won't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Yunaka] 
OK..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Yunaka] 
My parents abandoned me when I was small. 
After that, growing up was anything but easy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Yunaka] 
I don't like thinking about it. And I like talking 
about it even less."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Panette] 
I am so sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Panette] 
I know well the pain of being neglected by 
one's parents."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Yunaka] 
You too? Really?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Panette] 
Alas, yes. My father was a hopeless drunk. 
My mother was always out partying."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Panette] 
Who knew that we hailed from such similar 
backgrounds?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Yunaka] 
I wouldn't have guessed. But it's reassuring, 
in a way. Maybe I feel a little less alone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Panette] 
Hm?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Yunaka] 
Bandits. Incoming on our position."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Yunaka] 
I count...nine. No─ten."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Panette] 
Thought they could get the jump on us, eh? 
We'll show them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Panette] 
Listen up, pinheads! If I was you, I'd think twice 
about messing with me and her!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Panette] 
One more step and we'll turn your intestines 
into outtestines! Got it?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Yunaka] 
We're not here to kill anyone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Yunaka] 
But if you're here to be killed, well... My hands 
are tied."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Zappy morning, Panette!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Panette] 
Good morning, Yunaka. You seem to be in 
good spirits. As usual."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Yunaka] 
Always! It's one of my redeeming qualities."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Panette] 
Mm-hmm. In point of fact, I have been meaning 
to ask you about that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Panette] 
Why do you insist on pretending to be cheerful 
all the time?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Yunaka] 
You think I'm acting? You think I'm so talented, 
I can keep it up all the time? I-I'm flattered!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Panette] 
Ah-ah-ah. Do not bluff a bluffer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Panette] 
I can tell that this is not your true manner."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Panette] 
When I began serving the boss, I had to swap 
out my own dialect for a more proper one."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Panette] 
Since then, I have had a keen ear for others' 
false tongues."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Takes one to know one, doesn't it..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Yunaka] 
I can't answer your question, though."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Yunaka] 
If I spoiled the mystery, who would you harass 
with prying questions? My hands are tied."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Panette] 
Hm. So be it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Panette] 
Forgive me for probing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Panette] 
But this duplicity... Somehow it does not sit 
right with me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Yunaka] 
Uh huh..."
