[Anna] 
HIYAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Anna] 
Hmm... That last stroke felt a little off. Weird."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Anna] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Anna] 
I miss them all so much..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Bunet] 1 
[Bunet] 
Hello, Lady Anna. You seem to be hard at work."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Anna] 
Oh... Hey, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Anna] 
I don't think you'll want the wood I chopped 
today. My form is way off."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Bunet] 
I didn't come for firewood today."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Bunet] 
Here. I made you a salmon stew. I hope it's 
like what you remember."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Anna] 
Oh, wow! Can I eat it now?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Bunet] 
Yes, please do. While it's warm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Anna] 
Thanks a bunch!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Anna] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Anna] 
Mmm! That warms me right to my bones. 
It tastes just like my family stew too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Bunet] 
I'm glad. It took some doing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Bunet] 
I had to research your hometown's cuisine and 
then seek out all the right spices."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Bunet] 
I wasn't confident that I had nailed down 
the flavor..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Anna] 
So that's why it tastes like home. Aww, you did 
all that for me? I'm really touched!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Anna] 
I was getting so homesick that it was messing 
up my woodcutting."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Anna] 
But that little taste of home cheered me right 
up again! I'm ready to split a hundred logs!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Bunet] 
If you ever feel homesick, come talk to me. 
I can at least take your taste buds back there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Anna] 
I appreciate it. So how much do I owe you 
for the stew?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Bunet] 
No need to pay. I meant it as a token of thanks."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Anna] 
Oh no! That's not going to work for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Anna] 
If I start taking charity, how am I supposed to 
sell you any more wood?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Bunet] 
Ha... You really are shrewd."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Bunet] 
In that case, pay me in firewood. However much 
you think that stew is worth."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Anna] 
Deal! I'll even throw in extra as an introductory 
offer. Nice doing business with you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Anna] 2 
[Anna] 
HIYAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Bunet] 1 
[Bunet] 
Nice chopping. Again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Anna] 
Let me guess... You're here for more wood?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Bunet] 
Indeed I am."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Bunet] 
This timber of yours burns so evenly, 
it's perfect for controlling stove heat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Bunet] 
The risotto I cooked with it yesterday... 
Flawless, even by my standards."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Anna] 
Great! Always nice to hear about a satisfied 
customer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Bunet] 
Lady Anna, I have to ask. How did you get so 
good at chopping wood?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Anna] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Anna] 
It's probably because it was one of my chores 
when I lived at home with my family."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Bunet] 
I see. You've had to work hard all your life, hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Anna] 
Now you've got me thinking about my family. 
That salmon stew we'd share was so good."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Anna] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Bunet] 
Um... Is something wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Anna] 
Nah, everything's peachy. Stand back and 
watch the master woodcutter at work!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Bunet] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Anna] 2 
[Anna] 
HIYAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Bunet] 1 
[Bunet] 
Hm. Nice chopping."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Bunet] 
The pieces of wood are perfectly equal. Really, 
I respect the artistry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Anna] 
Hehe! Glad you noticed. I am pretty good at 
chopping wood, it's true."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Anna] 
I use it as raw material for woodworking or 
whittling, which I then sell to folks."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Bunet] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Bunet] 
Anna, I have a favor to ask."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Anna] 
Oh, please. We're friendly enough that you can 
call me Lady Anna."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Bunet] 
Haha. Lady Anna, might I have some of 
this timber?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Anna] 
Hmm, that's an idea. Are you also into 
woodworking?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Bunet] 
Oh, no. It's not for me. It's for my stove."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Bunet] 
With such uniform pieces of firewood, it would 
be easier to precisely control the temperature."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Bunet] 
In other words...my cooking would be elevated 
to the next level."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Bunet] 
Give them to me...please?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Anna] 
Is that how that works? Well, if you feel that 
strongly about it, we could work something out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Anna] 
You'll have to pay, of course. I don't give 
anything away for free."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Bunet] 
Heh, you are a shrewd one."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Anna] 
I've gotta be if I'm gonna make it on my own."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Bunet] 
I will pay you your due. The firewood is worth 
any expense."
