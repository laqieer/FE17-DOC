[Hortensia] 
Lady Veyle...can we talk?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
Oh, Hortensia. Yes, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
I have something to say to you now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
Please."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Hortensia] 
It was ignorant of me to judge you without even 
trying to get to know you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Hortensia] 
It's easy to reject someone out of hand that 
way. But that doesn't make it right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Hortensia] 
So, I've decided I would like to try being friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
You would?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Hortensia] 
I still don't know if I can ever really forgive you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Hortensia] 
And maybe once we do get to know each other, 
I'll decide I actually can't stand you after all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Hortensia] 
But I owe you a chance at least. So, what do 
you say? Is that OK with you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Veyle] 
Yes! I will happily accept that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Hortensia] 
Good. Then, as a token of our friendship...please 
accept these sweets."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Hortensia] 
These are your favorites, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Veyle] 
Oh, um..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Hortensia] 
I was sure Father said you loved these... 
Am I misremembering?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Veyle] 
Sorry, Hortensia. I don't like sweet food at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Hortensia] 
You don't?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Veyle] 
The...other me...might have liked sweets. 
But the real me loves spicy food."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Hortensia] 
Oh, wow."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Hortensia] 
Hm-hm, you really are a completely different 
person from before."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Hortensia] 
OK. I'll treat you to something spicy next time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Veyle] 
I... I'd love that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Hortensia] 
In return, I'll ask you to tell me everything you 
can about yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Hortensia] 
I want to know so much about the real you that 
I don't ever think about the other one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Veyle] 
That sounds wonderful. And you have to tell me 
about yourself too. I want to know everything."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Hortensia] 
Yeah. I think if we can understand each other... 
this wound of mine might actually heal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Hortensia] 
So let's get to healing, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Veyle] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Veyle] 
Um, Hortensia?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Hortensia] 
I'm not sure I can be any clearer about how 
little I want to see or talk to you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Veyle] 
Please, let me say one more thing. There's a 
story I want to tell you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Veyle] 
It's about my mother. You see, she was just a 
regular dragon, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Veyle] 
She was also the Fell Dragon's mate. Humans 
hated her for it and persecuted her. She died."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Veyle] 
When I didn't age, the humans knew what I was, 
and they persecuted me too. It was...terrible."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Veyle] 
So, being a Fell Dragon has given me nothing, 
and it has taken everything."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Hortensia] 
I get it. You've lost family too. Is that all you 
had to say to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Veyle] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Veyle] 
I'm sorry I tried to force our friendship. I did a 
horrible thing to you. It was too much to ask."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Veyle] 
Goodbye, Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Wait."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Hortensia] 
I'm sorry for being so harsh to you. I didn't 
know about all that. I was inconsiderate."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Hortensia] 
That's all. You can go."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Veyle] 
OK...and thank you for listening to my story."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Veyle] 2 
[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Veyle] 
Hortensia, I wanted to tell you that I... I'd like us 
to be friends."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Veyle] 
So...I wonder if we could talk?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Hortensia] 
I have nothing to say to you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Veyle] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
My father is dead because of you. Why would 
I want to be friends?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Hortensia] 
It doesn't matter to me if you were controlled 
or whatever and now you're back to normal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Hortensia] 
I'll never forget the sight of you laughing as you 
watched my father die."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Hortensia] 
So please, just...leave me alone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Veyle] 
I... I've wanted so badly to apologize for that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Elusia should never have allowed worship of 
the Fell Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Hortensia] 
His power, though... Much as I hate to admit it, 
I do envy that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Hortensia] 
If I'd been born with what he has─what you 
have─my father would still be alive."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Veyle] 
Be glad you weren't born a Fell Dragon. It's a 
life full of fear, pain, and persecution."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Veyle] 
I wish I had been born human. To me, that life 
seems so much more...bearable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Hm-hm, yeah. I'm sure it's terrible. Poor thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Hortensia] 
We'll never be friends, Veyle. Goodbye."
