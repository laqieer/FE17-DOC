I remember that battle as if it were yesterday."
MID_BT1_#002,"[Micaiah] Status 
[Micaiah] 
It's almost like I'm there again. The past and 
the future are together in my heart."

[Alear] 
You're a strong combatant, but I'm not going 
to lose!"
MID_BT1_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Angry 
[Micaiah] 
Very well! I'd be let down if you held anything 
back!"
MID_BT2_#001,"[Yunaka] t 
[Yunaka] Sad 
[Yunaka] 
I've never been great at fighting magic users, 
so...maybe go easy on me?"
MID_BT2_#002,"[Micaiah] b 
[Micaiah] 
Smile 
[Micaiah] 
Sorry, but that's not the point of this. I won't be 
holding back."
MID_BT2_#003,"[Micaiah] 
Relax 
[Micaiah] 
You took me from that shrine, and now it's 
my turn to guide you to somewhere new."
MID_BT2_#004,"[Yunaka] 
Angry 
[Yunaka] 
Is that right? Guess I'd better be ready for 
you, then!"

[Micaiah] 
Well done. You passed the trial safely."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Micaiah."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Micaiah] 
Do you feel that? Our bond is stronger."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Alear] 
I do, yes. I feel like I understand you better 
than before."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alear] 
There's just one thing..."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Micaiah] 
What's that?"
MID_ED1_#007,"[Alear] 
You know...I was sort of hoping I might gain 
some of your fortune-telling ability."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Micaiah] 
Haha! Don't worry, you don't need that."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Micaiah] 
You can already see the future. In fact, you're 
building it."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
I'm building the future? Is that one of 
your predictions?"
MID_ED1_#011,"[Micaiah] 
Nope. It's something I see right in front of me."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Micaiah] 
I see someone with the strength to never lose 
heart, no matter what. You're a fighter."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Alear] 
It's an honor to know that you think so. I'll do 
my best not to disappoint."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Micaiah] 
Not a chance. Come on, let's go save the world."
MID_EV1_#001,"[Micaiah] b 
[Micaiah] 
Relax 
[Micaiah] 
You've got to earn this, . 
Defend yourself!"

Let's finish this fight quickly. All units, attack!"

[Alear] 
Hey, look. It's started snowing..."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I'm certain I've been here before...or someplace 
just like it."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
Where do you think we are, Micaiah?"
MID_OP1_#004,"[Micaiah] 
This looks somewhat like Castle Nox. I battled 
Ike there once."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Alear] 
Huh? Castle Nox? You fought against Ike?"
MID_OP1_#006,"[Micaiah] 
It was snowing then too."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Micaiah] 
Ike was a strong commander, as was I. But we 
each had a different definition of victory."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Micaiah] 
Ike was trying to save us, and I could not let 
him. We needed help but not his."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Micaiah] 
My people were cursed by a magical blood pact 
and headed for certain ruin."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Alear] 
What happened?"
MID_OP1_#011,"[Micaiah] 
I fought Ike─fought to undo the pact. I held 
on to hope."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Micaiah] 
I stayed focused on my vision of the future. 
Even on the worst day, I kept hold of that."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Micaiah] 
I gave everything to protect people I cared for. 
I'd have sacrificed more if there'd been need."
MID_OP1_#014,"[Micaiah] 
That vision is what made it possible for me to 
survive the war."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Alear] 
I think I know now why we were brought here."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Alear] 
Teach me how you never broke in the face of 
despair and fear, Micaiah."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Micaiah] 
So you've figured it out then? The point of 
this trial?"
MID_OP1_#018,"[Micaiah] 
Well then, face me in battle, . 
And do your best to be victorious."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Micaiah] 
If you win, our bond will strengthen, and you'll 
be able to draw on my power like never before."
