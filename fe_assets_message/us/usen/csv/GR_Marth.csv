MID_GR_Alfred_A_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You have a true passion for exercise. I applaud 
your dedication."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
I was a sickly kid, so I used to do it to toughen 
up. It's grown into a hobby by now."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Marth] 
Illness can lay low even the hardiest knight. 
You have done well to compensate for it."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Alfred] 
I train hard, that's all. Speaking of which, I'm 
going for a run. Wanna join me?"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You look troubled, Alfred. Is there something 
weighing on you?"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
I was feeling down about how scrawny I still 
am. Maybe I'll go for a jog. That usually helps."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Alfred] 
That's the ring the Divine One wore in their 
sleep. What an honor to serve with you."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Marth] 
I am glad to fight beside such a worthy prince. 
Together, may we bring about peace."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Anna] 
Good news! Today is now officially ""Marth-Anna 
Friendship Day""!"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Marth] 
An occasion worth marking. But why declare 
it a holiday all its own?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Anna] 
Because that means there's gotta be a party! 
Also, it'll help make sure I never forget you!"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Well, I am honored to be celebrated. But I would 
remember you fondly even without a holiday."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Anna] 
You should stop by my village when the fighting 
is over! We'll throw a big ol' party for you!"
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Marth] 
I would enjoy seeing where you hail from. 
I have heard each day there is a festival."
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
I worried how you would fare in combat, but 
you have proven to be a staunch ally, Anna."
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Anna] 
I got pretty good with an axe from all the wood 
I used to chop. And that's Lady Anna to you!"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You are trying to rebuild your parents' 
restaurant, I hear. It was destroyed by bandits?"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
Yes. It was a terrible time for me. But my dear 
friend Fogado...he saved me."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
He made me his personal chef and his knight. 
I owe my whole life to the prince."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Marth] 
So, the two of you are bound together by food 
and friendship. Beautiful bonds indeed."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Bunet] 
Emblems are incapable of eating, I'm told. It 
saddens me to know I can't treat you to a meal."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Marth] 
Not to worry, Bunet. Watching everyone enjoy 
your cooking will be pleasure enough for me."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
I am told you cook the most delicious dishes. 
You are a chef and a knight? Truly impressive."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Bunet] 
Cooking is my passion. Perhaps you will teach 
me a recipe from your own world one day?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Boucheron] 
This war has ravaged the land and polluted the 
waters. It needs to stop, and soon."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Your hometown is a good village, I hear, with 
greenery everywhere. Clear water too, I expect."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Yes. The rivers there are like crystal. I'd often 
go there to fish. I wonder if they still sparkle..."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Draw strength from your love of the land. 
Combine it with ours as we work to bring peace."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
Do your eyes fill with tears, Boucheron? 
Has something tragic happened?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
No... I've been reading a tragedy, not living one. 
Every time I think about it, the tears gush."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Boucheron] 
It's an honor to stand beside you in battle. 
I've got a lot to live up to as a royal soldier."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Marth] 
We must all rise to meet our own challenges, 
Boucheron. Let us do so together."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Céline] 
I love my kingdom and its people, which is why 
I have resolved to fight on their behalf."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Marth] 
I know all too well that there are things in this 
world worth taking up arms to defend."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Céline] 
Thank you. It's good to know others feel as I do. 
I breathe easier fighting with one of like mind."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Marth] 
I shall fight by your side as long as you will 
have me─until the day your kingdom is safe."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Céline] 
That's a lovely circlet you wear. It complements 
your attire...and clearly has sentimental value."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Marth] 
Well spotted. It is very precious, gifted as it was 
by someone dear to me."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Céline] 
Never did I dream that I would meet an Emblem 
in person. There is so much I want to discuss."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Marth] 
I would be delighted to hear stories of the 
kingdom of Firene─and of yourself."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Chloé] 
Until I met Princess Céline, I knew nothing of 
the world. I never thought it could be so vast."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Marth] 
So many work tirelessly just to survive. Think of 
them as you fight."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
I'll try as hard as I must to keep them safe. 
Is that the secret to it, Marth?"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Marth] 
It is. Together with our allies that we have 
grown so close to, we shall bring about peace."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Chloé] 
There's nothing wrong with resting now and 
then. Why not take it easy for the next battle?"
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Marth] 
I agree, and you should do the same. I want to 
see this war through without losing anyone."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Chloé] 
Talking to the Emblem who watched over the 
Divine One makes me feel like I'm in a fairy tale."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Marth] 
I enjoy our chats. Being around a pegasus knight 
always reminds me of someone very dear to me."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
Alcryst places much trust in you. There is a 
familial closeness there, if I'm not mistaken."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Alcryst and I are cousins! We grew up around 
each other, so we're quite comfortable together."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
The same goes for Diamant. I don't see a crown 
prince or a flawless warrior...I just see Diamant."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Relationships built on time and trust. Wonderful. 
I hope we can claim the same someday."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Marth...do you think I'm useful in battle? I know 
that my magic needs a fair amount of work..."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Marth] 
You do very well out there, Citrinne, and you 
grow stronger with each day. I have faith in you."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Thank you for lending us your strength, Marth. 
I'll do everything I can to repay your kindness."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Marth] 
It is clear that you love your kingdom, Citrinne. 
We shall fight together until peace is restored."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Clanne] 
I figured out why you're called the Hero-King. 
You're super powerful and don't need anyone."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Not at all. I was powerless on my own. I only 
succeeded with the help of others."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Marth] 
My life belonged to my friends and their own to 
me. I fought for them, and they called me hero."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
So, power is earned and not given? Thanks for 
teaching me that, Lord Marth."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Clanne] 
Lord Marth, do you have anyone you admire? 
Like, someone you look at and think, ""wow""?"
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Marth] 
I admire all my friends that I form strong 
bonds with. Like you, Clanne."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
I watched you perform in battle. You are quite 
skilled. I am glad to be working with you."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Oh, wow. You think I'm good? That's a real 
honor. I promise to try and live up to it!"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Diamant] 
Do you struggle with any specific skills, Marth? 
Between you and me...magic intimidates me."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Marth] 
The crown prince of Brodia is not as flawless 
as rumored? Is there a story behind this?"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
When I was young...I set off an explosion during 
a magic lesson. I've feared it ever since."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Where you struggle, rely on your friends. I did, 
and so was also known as the Rallying Hero."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Diamant] 
I won't rule the same way my father did. I want 
Brodia to prosper, but not through warfare."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Marth] 
Important considerations for any heir. Of course 
you will do what is best for your kingdom."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Diamant] 
It's an honor to fight beside such a mighty hero. 
I'm glad to have you with us, Marth."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Marth] 
I feel the same way, Diamant. Let us stand 
together in the name of peace."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Etie] 
Wish these thoughts would stop buzzing in my 
head. Only one thing to do about that."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Are you troubled by doubts, Etie?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Marth] 
You may feel better talking about it. A fear 
shared is often a fear dispelled."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Etie] 
I appreciate it, but nothing works for me like 
exercise. I'm gonna out-jog these doubts!"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Etie] 
Hey, Marth. I was just about to have some tea 
if you want to join me."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Marth] 
I cannot sip tea with you, but I can discern the 
smell. I'm content to appreciate that if you are."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Etie] 
Heya, Marth. You caught me in my favorite 
mood─just after a good, hard workout!"
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Marth] 
Your diligence in training with the bow might 
put you on par with Altea's finest archer."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
I hear Timerra went camping all across the 
queendom. Have you traveled like that as well?"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Fogado] 
I've hit the road plenty as a Sentinel. Many 
people I meet say I look just like the prince."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
See, most folks only know the royal family from 
our portraits. They don't realize I am the prince."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Ah, and you still have not corrected them. You 
are a very unusual prince indeed, Fogado."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You and your sister are quite close, aren't you? 
You trust each other even when you're apart."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Fogado] 
Yeah, my family is a tight-knit bunch. No matter 
where we are, our hearts are always connected."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Fogado] 
All this fighting is exhausting. What we need 
is a big ol' feast to liven things up, right?"
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Marth] 
A feast can be a good way to inspire people. 
And while I cannot eat, I can socialize."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Framme] 
Emblem Marth, were you there the whole time... 
while the Divine Dragon slept, I mean?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Marth] 
I was there...though time passed quite quickly. 
I saw the admirable job you did standing guard."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Framme] 
Thank you! And I'm gonna do an even better job 
for you and for the Divine Dragon from now on."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Marth] 
I do not doubt it, Framme. Together, we are 
sure to be an unstoppable force."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You look rather pleased, Framme. What are you 
doing there?"
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Framme] 
Oh, I'm just writing a letter to my family. They 
live far away, and I want them to know I'm OK."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Framme] 
I'm sooo honored I get to fight beside you, 
Emblem Marth. I'll try not to hold you back."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Marth] 
You have nothing to worry about, Framme. 
Together we will bring this battle to an end."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Goldmary] 
This may be hard to fathom now, but I used to 
be quite complacent and difficult to motivate."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Indeed that is hard to fathom. How did you 
become the Goldmary you are today?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
I was caught in a battle. War is a cruel but 
effective teacher. It made me want to be more."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Marth] 
War came to me in my youth, in much the same 
way. It seems we are alike in that regard."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if I completely overshadow you, Marth, 
but you're charming in your own right."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Marth] 
No need for concern. This army has many 
personalities more charming than my own."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
Without the ring you returned, we might very 
well be lost. Thank you, Goldmary."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I see you know how to give a compliment. 
I think we'll get along just fine, Marth."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Hortensia] 
I'm gonna do whatever it takes to help my sister 
put our kingdom back together."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Marth] 
I was forced to flee my war-torn homeland as 
well, long ago. I had the same determination."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
How did it turn out for you? Did you restore 
your country's glory?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Marth] 
With the help of those allies I spoke of before. 
I believe you shall do the same for Elusia."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
I admire you staying in Elusia as long as you 
did. It was noble of you to help those people."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Hortensia] 
It's what my father would have done. He always 
thought of his kingdom first."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Hortensia] 
You're a popular guy, aren't you, Marth? 
I've got an eye for this sort of thing."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Marth] 
I suspect not in the way you mean, although 
I have been blessed to have many allies."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Ivy] 
I sometimes wish I had your ability to trust 
people unconditionally."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Marth] 
You trust your people, no? You also trusted 
your allies enough to bring them those rings."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
That's true. I suppose the time I've spent with 
our allies has made me...protective of them."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Marth] 
The bonds we forge with others always make 
us stronger."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Ivy] 
It's strange. Somehow I just feel comfortable 
around you─like I can tell you anything."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Marth] 
I am glad to hear that. Anytime you should need 
an ear, I shall be there to listen."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Ivy] 
So much has happened in such a short time. 
And there is yet more to be done."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Marth] 
You have been through a great deal. We shall 
ensure no one else need endure the same."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Jade] 
Sir Marth, I hope this isn't rude of me...but may 
I model a character in my new novel after you?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Marth] 
I am slightly embarrassed by your request, but, 
yes, you may. I look forward to reading it."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Jade] 
Thank you, Sir Marth. I hope you enjoy my 
writing. Prince Diamant certainly seems to."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Now that is a reliable review. I am eager to see 
what kind of character I become!"
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Jade] 
You seem to be loved by everyone, Sir Marth. 
It's as if your very presence puts others at ease."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Marth] 
They also feel safer with the ""Iron Wall"" herself 
among our ranks. Let us protect them together."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Jade] 
I represent Prince Diamant... Better be careful. 
It's an honor to work with you, Sir Marth."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Marth] 
I look forward to seeing you in action, Jade. 
Here's to our future!"
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Jean] 
Whew... Everyone's pushing themselves so 
hard─I can barely keep up with all the injuries."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Marth] 
I understand that it is difficult for you. But you 
must rise to meet the challenge, as they do."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Jean] 
That's true. And it's not like I have nothing to 
fight for. My home, the tea fields, my friends..."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Yours is the grease that keeps our wheel of war 
moving onward. We all appreciate your work."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Jean] 
I know I'm not a full-fledged doctor yet, but I'll 
find a niche for me here. There's gotta be one."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Marth] 
It astonishes me how deftly you can treat even 
serious injuries. We all rely on you, Jean."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Jean] 
It's my dream to be a doctor, just like my father. 
People will still get sick even after the war."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Marth] 
I am sure you will be a splendid doctor. I await 
the day you can fulfill that dream."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Marth! I have seen your future! Would you like 
to know what lies in store?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Marth] 
My future? That is a rather weighty decision, 
yet I admit I am curious. What did you see?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
You will assume a mighty pose during our next 
battle! I assume this means we will win!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Marth] 
A promising prediction indeed. I look forward 
to winning this victory with you."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Tell me of your homeland. I wish to hear 
particularly of its greatest fighters!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Marth] 
We had many powerful swordsmen, not unlike 
you. The Scarlet Sword comes to mind."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Marth! May our deep bond of friendship outlast 
all of time!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Marth] 
Indeed. Let us fight together as friends, from 
now until the end."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Lapis] 
Marth? If you had a dear friend that you might 
never see again...how would you handle it?"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Marth] 
That would be a terrible situation─wanting to 
speak with them, but being unable to do so..."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Marth] 
Still, I would think of them often. Any bonds 
forged between us would never break."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
Yeah! I think so too! You'd always be connected 
to them, no matter what... Thank you, Marth."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You are so resourceful, Lapis. Your many small 
efforts all add up to aid us in winning this war."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Lapis] 
Happy to help! Is there anything I can craft for 
you, Marth? Maybe a cute stand for your ring?"

[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You have incredible strength, Lapis. Our foes 
are fierce...but together, we will reclaim peace."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
I'm not sure how useful I'll be, but I'll try. Let's 
wish ourselves luck too. Couldn't hurt, right?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
Is that a portrait you gaze upon?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Lindon] 
Yes, it's of my late wife. I always keep it close 
wherever I go."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
Isn't she lovely? I'm proud to have given the 
best years of my life to this wonderful woman."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Marth] 
As you should be. I cannot see my own beloved 
right now, but I still feel her, connected to me."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Lindon] 
If you need my skills, just let me know. Making 
pastries with thunder is a specialty of mine!"
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Marth] 
What fascinating uses people devise for magic! 
Your talents will be in demand, even in peace."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
I have been told you are an excellent royal 
soldier. I am grateful to have you at my side."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Lindon] 
Every soul here is helping to restore peace to 
Elusia, which means I must do my part as well."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
It has not escaped my notice how considerate 
you are. Have you always been this way?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Louis] 
I've aimed to please since I was a child. Perhaps 
my large family of brothers was the cause."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Louis] 
I shall always be grateful to my family for that. 
It's why I was chosen as a retainer."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Ha, your support on the battlefield puts us all 
at ease. You serve us well, Louis."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Louis] 
Your interactions with the Divine One are a 
unique sight all their own. A fresh new canvas..."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Marth] 
A canvas? Apologies, I don't understand what 
you mean. Would you mind elaborating?"
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Louis] 
You're a captivating man, Marth. Your radiance 
enriches all who stand in your presence."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Marth] 
Louis, you flatter me. You do your own share 
to brighten the mood."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
It makes my heart sing to see how you have 
grown. You carry yourself with such confidence."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Alear] 
I'm lucky to have had so many good people to 
get me here. I never could have done it alone."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Alear] 
Will you be there with me as we see what the 
future holds, Marth?"
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Of course. Bonds such as ours are the 
foundation of the future. They will never fade."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Alear] 
You're just about the strongest person I know, 
Marth. How can I be more like you?"
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Marth] 
You can accomplish great things if you let your 
bonds with your friends become your strength."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
It is good that we can talk after I spent so long 
silently watching over you, ."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Alear] 
I know what you mean. I'm really glad to have 
you at my side, supporting me in person."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle has been in good spirits of late. 
This place is good for her."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Veyle is lucky to have your friendship 
and support."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
We have so many more companions than in 
the past, and for that I am very grateful."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Marth] 
The bonds of today pave the path to our future. 
We walk that path together, my friend."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Mauvier] 
I come from the kingdom of Firene. That is 
where I learned to treasure those close to me."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Marth] 
Those very feelings are what saved Veyle from 
darkness. I am glad you're here."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Mauvier] 
I am grateful for your allegiance. With you by 
my side, I shall atone for my past crimes."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Marth] 
You are a warrior with a righteous heart, and 
I am proud to join your cause."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Merrin] 
In Solm, women inherit the leadership roles. 
One day, I'll be the matriarch of my hometown."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Once peace is restored and that time comes, 
will you have to give up being a knight?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
No, I'm pleased to say my princess has given 
me leave to continue on in both roles."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Marth] 
She is a wise leader indeed. You are sure to be 
the...coolest matriarch that ever lived."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Merrin] 
I confess, I never get tired of eating sweets. 
Would you care to try one, Sir Marth?"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Marth] 
I am sure they are delicious. Alas, I cannot eat. 
It is fun to take in their pretty colors though."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
I must say, you fought gallantly in battle, Merrin. 
I could hardly take my eyes off you."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Merrin] 
I am pleased to hear you say so, Sir Marth. 
I hope I never disappoint you on the battlefield."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Timerra] 
I had so much fun on my camping trip! I met all 
kinds of folks, and we partied all night long."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Marth] 
I was surprised to hear you were camping. For a 
princess, you have a great deal of freedom."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
Yup, it's been really good for me. That freedom 
we all enjoy is why I'm trying to protect Solm."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Well, your travels have made you many friends, 
and I am grateful you consider me one of them."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Timerra] 
Hey, Marth! I wrote a song for you─you know, 
a little tune to inspire you. Wanna hear it?"
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Marth] 
You are too kind. I would love to hear it, though 
I wonder if you could sing it...quietly?"
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Timerra] 
Pretty much anything that's fun to do, I like 
doing. How 'bout you? What do you do for fun?"
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Marth] 
I have given it no thought. But learning to have 
fun sounds...fun. Perhaps you will teach me?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Never imagined fighting beside a dragon. A life 
of worship leads to this? Fate is a funny thing."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Is it fate that guides us? I cannot say for sure, 
but it does feel as if fate brought us together."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
And I am grateful! We must party sometime, 
unless that would be disrespectful."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Of course not. I am happy to join any festivities, 
especially if I get to hear you sing again."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Pandreo] 
The Ring Chamber is kinda dreary, yeah? 
I could easily liven it up with a bit of renovating."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Marth] 
What a fine idea. You redesigned your family 
church, yes? I hear it has been well received."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
So, it was you I heard singing earlier. You have 
a beautiful voice. I would love to hear more."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Lord Marth! You were listening?! I was singing 
a prayer to the Divine Dragon, that's all."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
I am curious, Panette, how did you become 
a retainer to Timerra?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Panette] 
I had left home on unpleasant terms, when I 
happened upon my lady. We hit it off at once."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Panette] 
I did not know she was royalty until she asked 
me to be her retainer. Imagine my surprise."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Unexpected bonds can change our lives. I hope 
ours is a meaningful one for you."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
How did you learn to don makeup in such a 
manner? I have never seen anything like it."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Panette] 
I found it in an ancient Solmic text. It is said to 
offer magical protection to those who wear it."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Panette] 
'Tis a glorious honor to fight by thy side, 
Lord Emblem! I shall not fail thee in battle!"
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Marth] 
No need for formalities. I am an Emblem, yet I 
would prefer you consider me an equal."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Rosado] 
I was pretty hopeless in school. Always too 
busy messing around to get anything done."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Marth] 
I would never have guessed, considering how 
studious you are now. What changed?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
I met Hortensia. Without her to push me along, 
I'd never have gotten my act together."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Marth] 
My friends are responsible for my finer qualities 
too. Let us be good influences on one another."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Rosado] 
Some cute clothes would do you a lot of good. 
You'd look great in an outfit like mine."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Marth] 
I appreciate the thought. Wonderful as your 
style is, I do not think it is for me."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Rosado] 
Hey, Marth! Can you give me a smile? Perfect. 
You're adorable!"
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Marth] 
I am not sure anyone ever called me that before. 
I am flattered though. Thank you."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Saphir] 
I grew up in a fishing village. Peaceful place... 
until Elusia came through and killed my family."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Marth] 
I know that pain well. Is that what motivated 
you to become a royal soldier?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
No, that was always my dream. Would've rather 
had my parents alive to see it, but...here I am."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Your feelings for your family led to our meeting, 
and for that I am grateful."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Saphir] 
Would you mind sparring with me sometime? 
I like to train against the toughest opposition."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Marth] 
Call on me whenever you wish. It would be 
my honor."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You have been defending Brodia for a long time. 
I will be relying on your experience."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Saphir] 
You fight with us now, which means you fight 
for Brodia too. Consider me grateful."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Seadall] 
My dancing is almost as good as my master's 
was. And yet, I still don't feel worthy of him."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Your master must have been an incredible 
dancer. I can see it in the way you move."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
He gave me so much. But he's joined the stars 
in the sky, and I can never give anything back."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Marth] 
Your dancing creates joy all around you, and 
surely that can be seen even from the stars."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Seadall] 
I love visiting places I've never been before. Tell 
me, Marth, what's it like where you're from?"
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Marth] 
Not so different from here, really. It is pretty. 
I even had a friend who danced for us like you."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
Thank you for protecting Corrin's ring, Seadall. 
I understand you are a famous dancer."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Seadall] 
I admit I have something of a reputation. But the 
stars tell me you're quite famous as well, Marth."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Alcryst] 
You're really incredible, Lord Marth. I apologize 
for being such a disappointment..."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Disappointment? Never. You are skilled with a 
bow and fighting for your kingdom."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Alcryst] 
But the list ends there. Those are the only 
things I can do."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Marth] 
No, Alcryst. Those are not the only things you 
can do. They are things that only you can do."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Alcryst] 
You're so charming, Lord Marth... I wish I had 
even a fraction of your charisma."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Marth] 
There is plenty to like about you, Alcryst. I hope 
you grow to recognize that."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Aww, I'm sorry, Lord Marth! Emblems like you 
should never have to look upon one like me."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Marth] 
It's...it's all right. Don't speak about yourself 
that way. You are among friends."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
I hear you became a retainer after going against 
your family and entering a fighting tournament."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Amber] 
Yeah, I didn't hate living back home...but it was 
boring! I had to leave to start my own legend."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Amber] 
After the tourney, Diamant came to speak with 
me. He asked me to be his retainer─and I lost it!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Marth] 
So, you realized your dream through sheer force 
of will. I think you may be a legend already."
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Amber] 
Say, where were you born, Marth? Is it part of a 
legend just like you? I'm really into that stuff!"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Marth] 
The history of my kingdom starts with the hero 
Anri... I shall tell you his story sometime."
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Amber] 
Whoa! I get to fight alongside an Emblem?! I am 
so, so glad I became a royal retainer!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Marth] 
You flatter me, Amber. Please, just think of me 
as another ally fighting to protect this world."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You are quite skilled with your hands, Vander. 
I was unaware you can knit."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
I say it's merely a hobby, but I took it up for 
its practical uses, as well as for relaxation."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Vander] 
My thinking is, once peace is restored, I shall 
engross myself wholly in my knitting."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Marth] 
A good plan. Let us end this war and make the 
world a place where you may knit in peace."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Vander] 
Lord Marth, would you care for an apple? I have 
developed quite the taste for them, you see."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Marth] 
I wish I could join you. Alas, I cannot eat. I am 
glad it brings you pleasure though."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Vander] 
Hero-King Marth, will you stand with me? 
In the name of the Divine Dragon?"
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Marth] 
Happily. We each have a duty to perform, so 
let us join forces."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Veyle] 
I finally know what it's like to feel happy, Marth. 
For the first time in my life, I feel like I belong."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Marth] 
You have been through so very much. But now, 
you are surrounded by allies and friends."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
Thank you for your kind words. I just hope...you 
also think of me as a friend."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Marth] 
I do. And our friendship will last forever. You 
will never have to be alone again, Veyle."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Veyle] 
Sometimes I wonder if it's really OK for me to 
be here. What if...I'm meant to be alone?"
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Marth] 
Oh, Veyle, do not ever question your place here. 
You are precious to every one of us."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Veyle] 
Thank you, Marth, for fighting beside me. 
Especially after what I did before."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Marth] 
Do not apologize. You are a good person. 
From now on, we fight together."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Say, Marth... What would you do if you found 
out I'd done something terrible in the past?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Marth] 
Nothing. It's not my place to judge your past, 
Yunaka. I trust the person you are now."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
You trust me? What'd I ever do to deserve that?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Marth] 
A terrible person would not ask a question like 
that so earnestly. That is enough for me."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Tell me... Do you think there's such a thing 
as a fresh start?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Marth] 
Everyone has the potential to change. All they 
need is the determination to make it happen."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You speak with a most unusual dialect, Yunaka. 
Where did you pick it up, exactly?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Oh, nowhere. I'm one of a kind! Wanna give it 
a try? Say it with me... Zappy!"
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Zelkov] 
The loss of my family left me with an emptiness 
that not even *revenge* was able to fill."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Marth] 
I know that loss, and the emptiness that follows 
it, exceptionally well."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
Fighting for Princess Ivy gives me *relief.* 
Thank you for giving me the strength to do so."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Marth] 
No need to thank me. I only hope that your 
feelings of emptiness end with the war."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Marth] 2 
[Marth] 
You work too hard, Zelkov. A little rest now 
and then would do you good."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Zelkov] 
I appreciate the sentiment, but it is unnecessary. 
I fear *idleness* more than lack of rest."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Marth] 2 

[Zelkov] 
My main *pursuit* is to win us victory. For that 
purpose, Marth, consider me at your disposal."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Marth] 
That is kind of you, but I will accept no offer 
of service. Let us fight together as equals."
