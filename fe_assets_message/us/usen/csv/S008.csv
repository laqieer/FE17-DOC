Smile 

[Eirika] 
Fighting you here... It feels so strange."
MID_BT1_#002,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Smile 

[Alear] 
I feel it too. Facing you like this is making 
me stronger."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Eirika] 
Relax 

[Eirika] 
You've been strong from the start. Now, show 
me you have the skills to back up your strength."
MID_BT2_#001,"[Rosado] t 
[Rosado] 
Smile 

[Rosado] 
I didn't think we'd get to hang out this much, 
Eirika. It's been lots of fun!"
MID_BT2_#002,"[Eirika] b 

[Eirika] 
Smile 

[Eirika] 
I'm glad that it's you who engaged with me. 
Every day is a new experience."
MID_BT2_#003,"[Rosado] Surprise 

[Rosado] 
Aw, thanks so much! Now you've got me 
blushing, though..."
MID_BT2_#004,"[Eirika] 
Heh. Well, raise your weapon or I'll have to 
embarrass you further."
MID_BT3_#001,"[Goldmary] t 
[Goldmary] Sad 
[Goldmary] 
Well, Eirika, it's time to see which of us is more 
graceful in battle."
MID_BT3_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if my skill proves to be too much 
for you."
MID_BT3_#003,"[Eirika] b 

[Eirika] 
Smile 

[Eirika] 
No apology necessary. Seeing you grow as a 
warrior has been a pleasure."
MID_BT3_#004,"[Eirika] 
Angry 

[Eirika] 
But that doesn't mean I plan on losing!"
MID_ED1_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You've gotten stronger. You might even be able 
to defeat Ephraim, my brother."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
Thank you! I guess you've always relied on your 
brother, haven't you?"
MID_ED1_#003,"[Eirika] 
I wouldn't... I mean... We're siblings. And we 
always need one another's support."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Alear] 
I guess I hadn't thought of it that way."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alear] 
You should know that I rely on you, Eirika. 
I trust your opinions and your skills."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Eirika] 
Thank you. I just want to be a help to your 
cause, the same as others helped me."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Eirika] 
I'm so very happy to be part of this and to help 
all of you."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Alear] 
You've saved me so often. I'm starting to think 
I'd be lost on my own."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Eirika] 
Hehe, you should have more confidence."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Eirika] 
As long as we both trust in our own skills, we 
can be there to support one another."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Alear] 
That sounds good to me. I hope you'll continue 
to be with us, Eirika."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Eirika] 
I hope so too, . I'm sure you can 
save this world."
MID_EV1_#001,"[Eirika] b 

[Eirika] 
Relax 

[Eirika] 
Now let us begin, !"
MID_EV2_#001,"[Eirika] b 

[Eirika] Strike 

[Eirika] 
Hmm. I see no gaps in your defenses, but that 
doesn't mean you'll win easily."

[Eirika] 
Look at this place! Oh my. It can't be... 
It's impossible!"
MID_OP1_#002,"[Alear] 
What's wrong, Eirika?"
MID_OP1_#003,"[Eirika] 
This looks almost exactly like... I'd swear to 
you, this is where everything changed forever."
MID_OP1_#004,"[Alear] 
Changed? How so?"
MID_OP1_#005,"[Eirika] 
I was a member of the royal family of Renais."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Eirika] 
Our close neighbors, the Grado Empire, were 
our allies for centuries."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Eirika] 
Then with no hint of warning, the Grado Empire 
invaded."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Alear] 
That must have been difficult, if you were allies 
for so long."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Eirika] 
As the royal family, my brother and I fought 
together with our friends to protect our people."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Eirika] 
The final conflict took place right here."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Eirika] 
I know things only look similar, but it's very 
much like being back there."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Alear] 
You don't have to go on. I understand that it's 
a painful memory."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Eirika] 
I... I lost a very dear friend that day."
MID_OP1_#014,"[Alear] 
But you didn't lose hope─you fought on. 
Even when faced with losing a friend."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Eirika] 
I─ Would you spar with me? Here?"
MID_OP1_#016,"[Eirika] 
Everything I feel about that day is bound up. 
My heart is full of grief..."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Eirika] 
Perhaps fighting here will help overcome that. 
Though that sounds like my brother's thinking."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Alear] 
I would be glad to spar with you. However, 
I don't plan on losing."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Eirika] 
Well, you wouldn't last long if you didn't try 
to win."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Eirika] 
And if you do win, then our bonds will only 
become stronger."
