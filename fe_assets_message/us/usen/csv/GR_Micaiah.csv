MID_GR_Alfred_A_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Alfred] 
I train and train, but I just can't seem to build 
muscle. Any idea why that might be?"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Maybe it's your constitution? My oldest friend 
had the same problem."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
I know! I'll get the whole kingdom together to 
come up with something to push past my limits!"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Wow, you're serious about this. It's good to 
be committed, but be careful not to overdo it."
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Alfred] 
I hear you can sense people's thoughts. Bet it 
won't work on me! I've been training."
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Oh? You seem pretty sure about that. 
Why don't we test that claim?"
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Alfred] 
I'm happy to fight alongside one of the 
Emblems our kingdom kept safe."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I feel the same way. I wondered what you might 
be like, and you're as amazing as I hoped."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Your grumbling has been noticeable for a while 
now, Anna. Is there something wrong?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Anna] 
Yeah. Sales have been in a slump. I've gotta 
turn things around, and fast."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Anna] 
I know! You predict what'll sell in the future and 
I'll make sure to stock it! I'm a genius!"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! We can certainly try that, but these 
things don't always go the way you'd think."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
It's really impressive that you run a business 
all by yourself, Anna. And at your age too."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Anna] 
Don't bring age into this! I was born to sell, 
and I've been selling since I was born!"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Anna] 
Micaiah! You won't believe what I just got in 
stock! Come take a peek─you won't regret it!"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! All right, all right. You're a merchant 
through and through, aren't you?"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Bunet] 
To be a great chef, one must have a profound 
understanding of flavors─of ALL flavors."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! You sound like someone who has a true 
passion for his profession."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
That I do. Which is why I'd love to know what 
flavor that fabulous silver hair of yours is."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
I suppose...none? It has no physical form, you 
see. But I'll take your curiosity as a compliment."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What do you have there, Bunet? Something 
special for a dish you're preparing?"
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Bunet] 
These are edible flowers. They're difficult to 
grow but taste heavenly in tea and salads."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Are you heading to the garden, Bunet? 
If so, might I accompany you?"
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Bunet] 
You love flowers, don't you? Please, join me. 
Let's enjoy all the garden has to offer."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You seem a little down. What's the matter?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Well, Prince Alfred was saying, once again, how 
jealous he is of my physique."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
He wished he could ""trade everything from the 
neck down."" Now I'm stuck with that image."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! I can see why he'd wish that, but I think 
you're both perfect the way you are."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Ohoho, I love fishing. When my line is cast, I 
could sit there without a thought in my head."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I know what you mean. For me, I can relax like 
that in the shade of the forest's trees."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Ah, um...Micaiah, right? Could I trouble you to 
tell me my fortune?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Boucheron, if you're lost, you can just ask me 
for directions."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Céline] 
Is it true that you can foresee the future? Do 
you find that to be a blessing or a burden?"
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I've had some unpleasant visions, if that's what 
you mean. They made it hard to stay positive."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
But they don't necessarily come true. We have 
the power to shape our own tomorrow."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Céline] 
I believe it is your ability to see silver linings─ 
rather than the future─that makes you special."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Céline] 
Prayer alone won't bring peace. We must keep 
fighting, no matter how thorny the path."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
You're right. We have to fight together. I'll back 
you up anytime, Céline."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Céline] 
So you were in Firene the whole time, Micaiah? 
I was quite surprised when Mother told us."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
My Emblem Ring was something of a secret. 
But I'm glad the secret's out, so we can talk!"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What made you become a knight, Chloé?"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Chloé] 
I loved the idea of a young noble on pegasus- 
back protecting the princess, like in fairy tales."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
Oh, but I take it seriously too! I'm going to fight 
for a peaceful Firene, if you'll fight with me!"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
That sounds like a lovely tale. I'd be happy to 
play a part in it."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Chloé] 
I got my hands on some salted, fermented fish. 
I hear it tastes good enough to knock you flat!"
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Never mind the taste. I'm worried the smell will 
be enough to do the job..."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Chloé] 
Wow, Micaiah! You're looking radiant as ever. 
All you need now is a sweet little bird."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! Thank you! You're looking like 
something out of a storybook yourself."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Children always cry when they see me smile... 
How can I get them to stop being scared of me?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
It's normal for children to fear strangers. 
I'm sure they won't cry after they've met you!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
Oh! I see! So...you don't find my smile even the 
least bit frightening, Micaiah?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Not one bit. I see only kindness. If that kindness 
can survive this war, it can survive anything."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You're carrying an awful lot of candy, Citrinne. 
Are you on your way to some sort of festival?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, this? I just discovered that a friend of mine 
has a sweet tooth. I'm on my way to spoil them!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Citrinne] 
This world must seem so confusing to you and 
your fellow Emblems. If I can ever help, I shall."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
How considerate! Thank you, Citrinne. I might 
take you up on that."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You look like you feel down, Clanne. 
Can I help you with anything?"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Clanne] 
I'm thinking about the Divine Dragon and, well, 
my heart kind of aches because of it."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
Imagine sleeping that long, then you wake up 
and it's just bad thing after bad thing..."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
That's sweet. Let us both help to end the war, 
so everyone can have peace in their life."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Clanne] 
I saw you in the Somniel's forest the other day, 
Lady Micaiah. What were you doing there?"
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I was listening to the birds. They remind me of 
an old friend, and it puts my mind at ease."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I can see why you revere the Divine Dragon. 
Few people possess such a special charm."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
I agree! Would you like to take care of the 
Divine Dragon with me?!"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Diamant] 
As a future king, I've studied all major subjects: 
political theory, economics, martial arts..."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Diamant] 
But magic? I could never get a handle on magic. 
It seems beyond me..."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
So...even the crown prince of Brodia has room 
for growth. That's a bit surprising!"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
If magic concerns you, just count on me. I'll do 
everything I can to support you in battle."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Another day of training? Your diligence is 
remarkable, Diamant."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Diamant] 
Commanders don't get days off. Daily training is 
the best way to keep the odds in our favor."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Diamant] 
I hear you're well-versed in magic, Micaiah. And 
you're a skilled healer as well? How impressive!"
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Such direct praise! I'm a bit embarrassed...but 
I do appreciate your kind words, Diamant."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Wow, your abs are so...toned. That must have 
taken a lot of work."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Etie] 
Yeah, I guess so. I just like giving my abs 
some tough love."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
How so?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Etie] 
By working them hard! The rougher the routine, 
the better that exhaustion feels afterward."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What a nice scent...and such pretty flowers! 
Isn't your hometown famous for its gardens?"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Etie] 
Yeah, I get them delivered sometimes. Not so 
much now, though, what with the war."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What's that you drink after your workouts? 
I've seen Alfred downing it too."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Etie] 
It's a special drink made with a raw egg. If I'm 
right, it should help build muscle mass!"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You are looking rather pleased with yourself, 
Fogado. Why is that?"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Fogado] 
I just got my hands on this super-rare musical 
instrument. I can't wait to give it to my sis."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
Oh, I'm sure she'll be delighted. You really do 
care for her, don't you?"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Fogado] 
You know how it is. You've got to show the love 
to the people you love."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Fogado] 
Hey, Micaiah. Got any plans for tomorrow?"
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
You're having another party, aren't you? But 
you had one yesterday and the day before that."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Fogado] 
Hey, Micaiah! I think it's time we throw a party 
to celebrate all our new friends. You in?"
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! That certainly sounds like fun. I would 
be happy to join."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Framme] 
Lady Micaiah! No matter what anyone says, I'm 
the Divine Dragon's number one fan! Right?!"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
What's this all about, Framme?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Framme] 
It's just, there are so many more Divine Dragon 
fans these days. What if I lose my spot?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Hmm, I see. Why don't I read your fortune? 
I think it might offer you the guidance you need."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Framme] 
Lady Micaiah, what sort of attendant do you 
like best? I mean, what qualities wow you?"
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Oh, Framme, you needn't change a thing. The 
Divine Dragon likes you exactly as you are."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You always look like you're having 
so much fun, Framme."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Framme] 
I am! I mean, I can't put a smile on the Divine 
Dragon's face if I'm not wearing one myself."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Goldmary] 
It's a shame my home village is so far away. 
I would love to show you the hot springs."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
That sounds like fun. A bath might be wasted 
on me, though, since I have no physical form."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
True. Maybe it's for the best, then. The envy 
would be too much for you, I'm sure."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! You seem to hear only what you want 
to hear."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You seem pensive, Goldmary. What's on 
your mind?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I'm usually the charming one in any pair, but in 
our case, I-I think it might actually be you."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I hope my staggering charisma isn't going to 
be a problem for you, Micaiah."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I'll do my best to keep it from interfering 
with our friendship."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Hortensia] 
My sister abandoned Elusia, even knowing I was 
still there. She left me behind."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
You and Ivy are family. She cares about you 
more than anyone else in the world. Trust me."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
How can you be so sure? Did you read her mind 
or something?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
No, but I know how she feels. There's someone 
I care for in much the same way."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Ugh, would you stop looking at me like that? 
It's like you're seeing my soul. I kinda hate it."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! I'm only making sure you're all right. 
I worry about you sometimes, that's all."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I'll do my best to help you all I can, Hortensia."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Hortensia] 
Hmph, I don't need you. But since you're cute, 
I'll give you a chance to prove yourself."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
It hurts to fight against your own ideals. 
I know that pain all too well."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Ivy] 
You managed to overcome that struggle, 
did you not?"
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
I hope someday to follow your example."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
No fortune-telling skills needed to predict that. 
I've seen what you're made of. You'll get there."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Why don't we take a relaxing stroll through 
the forest, Ivy?"
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Ivy] 
Can you sense when I'm feeling troubled? 
You always seem to know what I need."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I'm worried you might be pushing yourself 
too hard, Ivy."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Ivy] 
I swore to aid the Divine Dragon, Micaiah. 
That is what I'm going to do."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Jade] 
I hear you once led a band of freedom fighters 
called...the Dawn Brigade? Was that the name?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
That's right. But we weren't as pristine as that 
makes us sound. Some mistook us for bandits..."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Jade] 
You? Mistaken for a common, blade-licking 
bandit?! That's... Sorry, I just...can't picture it!"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
No need to hold back! It is pretty funny. Despite 
that confusion, most still called us ""virtuous."""
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Diamant was guffawing at a book earlier, and 
he told me you're the author! What is it about?"
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Jade] 
It's the saga of a certain alpaca wrangler. I just 
finished the fifth volume. Sounds like a hit!"
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Jade] 
It's said even a roadside pebble can shine like a 
gem with enough polish. Isn't that inspirational?"
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
That does apply to people as well, but in my 
eyes, Jade, you already shine like a gem."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Jean? Are you crying?"
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Jean] 
Sorry you had to see that... I lost a patient who 
got hurt in battle. I wasn't good enough."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Jean] 
And on top of that, I can't seem to stop crying. 
Why can't I just be grown-up already?"
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Going through this will make you stronger. 
You're going to be an amazing doctor, Jean."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
It's really something to see a boy your age so 
trained in medicine."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Jean] 
Well, I've still got a lot to learn. But it feels good 
to hear that you think I'm on the right track."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Jean] 
You can heal people without medicine or a staff, 
right? That's incredible."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Thank you, but it takes a lot out of me, so it's 
not something I can do all the time."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
The culture of my home is quite different from 
here. Studying Elusia has taught me very much."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
What have you learned?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
Many new fighting styles. I was undefeated at 
home, but here, Zelkov was able to best me."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! Sounds like you've got yourself 
a proper rival."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
I wish to be great friends with Princess Ivy, but 
it would seem she does not feel similarly."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
That may have been the case before, 
but perhaps she's come around."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Micaiah! Our bond of friendship is stronger than 
any other. Call on me for anything you need."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Um... Thank you? Though, I worry our bond is a 
little new for statements such as that one."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Is there a reason you're sneaking around, Lapis?"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Lapis] 
Micaiah?! I, uh, just got a bunch of taters from 
home. Er, the market! Yep, that's where I was..."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
Wow! You have so many! I just love potatoes. 
There's no bad way to cook them, you know?"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
You're a fellow tater fan? I never would have 
guessed. You're my kind of mysterious, Micaiah!"
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Lapis] 
I hope we can end this war soon. The longer the 
fighting drags on, the more commonfolk suffer."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I see why Alcryst enjoys your company, Lapis. 
You have a kind and righteous heart."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Your world differs from my own, but our forests 
share the same stillness. I pine for that quiet..."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
Yes! I love the forest too! I could spend a whole 
day there crafting fur─ I mean...birdwatching?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
That's a delicious-looking cake. Did you bake 
it yourself?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Lindon] 
Haha! Astute of you to recognize talent when 
you see it! I baked this using thunder magic."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
People only think of magic as a weapon, but it 
can be used in everyday life too."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
That's a beautiful idea. I wonder if I could find 
a use like that for my own magic..."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You carry that portrait of your wife around 
with you wherever you go, huh?"
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Lindon] 
We were always together, from our wedding 
to her death. This way, we're still together now."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Lindon? Why are you staring at me?"
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Lindon] 
Forgive me. I was just thinking that powerful 
mages can't be judged by outward appearances."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
What was that unusual blend of tea you made 
the other day? It was so dark."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Louis] 
That would have been black tea steeped in 
grape juice. It's how we brew it back home."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
Grape juice? That's an interesting way of doing 
it. Is there some reason for that?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Louis] 
They say it's very effective at keeping one 
looking young. We can't all be Emblems, alas."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Louis] 
What a joy it is to look upon you, Micaiah. My 
heart swells to behold such a radiant creature."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Wow, I usually don't get that kind of reaction 
when it's just me! You must be in a good mood."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You have a few young brothers, right? If they're 
like the boy I knew, they must be a handful."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Louis] 
Ah, how I envy this boy you mention! My early 
life was noticeably lacking in female friends."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alear] 
I'm afraid sometimes my own power won't be 
enough. Would you read my future for me?"
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I see a bright future for you. One that you'll 
forge with all the friends at your side."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
But I don't need any special foresight to know 
that. You're strong enough to overturn any fate."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Thank you. I shouldn't doubt myself so much, 
huh? I think I can do it...with your help, anyway."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alear] 
Out of curiosity, are there dragons in your 
world too?"
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Yes. We have wyverns, and humans who turn 
into dragons. But they're not divine, like you."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alear] 
You never fail to lift my spirits, Micaiah. I think 
it's that gentle smile you always wear."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I smile most when you're around. There's just 
something warm and comforting about you."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Was it you who sparked Veyle's love of 
frighteningly extra-spicy food?"
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Possible. It is not something I have considered."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
I did offer Lady Veyle some of my favorite spicy 
candy just after she awakened, after all."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
She always looks so happy with her cheeks full 
of candy. It's hard not to smile, seeing that."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Every minute, I worry. Could I have helped 
Lady Veyle sooner than I did?"
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
You stood by her side when she needed you 
most. I know that meant everything to her."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Mauvier] 
I shall atone for using your power to commit evil 
deeds. I ask only that you save Lady Veyle."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I suspect she would wish for someone other 
than herself to be saved."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Merrin] 
Is it true there are birds and dragons that can 
turn human in your world?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Yes, that is true. But I think you misunderstand, 
Merrin."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
They are humans that can turn into birds and 
dragons, not the other way around."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
What?! You mean, like the Divine Dragon?! 
Now I'm absolutely dying to meet one!"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Merrin] 
Micaiah, I must admit I feel an urge to protect 
you. But I wonder if you really need protecting?"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
You are kind, but do not let my looks deceive 
you. Once upon a time, I was a commander."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I am grateful for this chance to join forces with 
you, Merrin. United, we are a formidable force."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Merrin] 
That we are. And I am grateful to fight beside 
an Emblem as powerful and as lovely as you."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Timerra] 
Ya know, Micaiah, you have an amazing voice. 
It's really pretty, but it's also really strong."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Do you think so? I have never thought much 
of my voice."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
I bet you're a great singer. We should sing a 
duet sometime. I'll provide the instrumentals!"
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Oh my, that is a lot of pressure. But...I will do it. 
We can sing of our beautiful friendship."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Timerra] 
So, you can see through lies and see the future, 
am I right? I so wish I could do that!"
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
It does have its benefits, but I promise, I would 
never use my powers to cheat at a game."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Timerra] 
So, Micaiah, tell me─what do you love doing? 
Me, I love traveling, singing, and just having fun."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I enjoy reading books and listening to the wind... 
Mostly, I love the peace and quiet."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lady Micaiah? You have need of me?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Oh, I'm so sorry I interrupted you while you 
were praying. I just came by to say hello."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
It's all right. All those lives we took...I'm praying 
they rest in peace. Would you like to join me?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Yes, I'd like that. They may not forgive us, 
but still, I will pray for the souls lost in battle."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
I wondered whose pretty singing voice that was. 
Hmhm! You've drawn an audience, I see."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Lady Micaiah?! Y-you're too kind. It's weird, but 
these little birds surround me every time I sing."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Let me know if anything is weighing you down, 
OK? I bet you've got your share of worries."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
That's very kind, Pandreo, but everyone here 
is so thoughtful I find I'm completely at ease."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You want your fortune read? Hm, is this about 
the ghost seen wandering the Solm desert?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Panette] 
Indeed! Pray tell, does the ghost of the desert 
bandit who died with his riches truly exist?!"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
You seem awfully excited about this, Panette. 
Aren't you afraid of ghosts?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Panette] 
Afraid of ghosts? Not in the slightest! Besides, 
I've nothing to fear with you by my side."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Panette] 
I hear you are quite fond of the forest, Micaiah. 
We two should take a stroll in the woods."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Hm, I would like that. I've been curious to see 
what you catch with that big net of yours."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
That last battle was quite impressive. 
You were very brave, Panette."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Panette] 
I am the axe of the princess. I shall strike down 
any obstacle that dare try to impede her!"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Rosado] 
You have such beautiful silver hair, Micaiah. 
It gives you a soothing, sophisticated look."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Oh, thank you. I haven't always cared for it, 
myself. It made me stand out a bit too much."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
No such thing! I loved it the moment I laid eyes 
on it, and that should be all you need to know."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
That's high praise, coming from someone with 
hair as radiant as yours."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
That's a heavy-looking parcel. What's inside?"
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Rosado] 
Some cute little stones I picked up around the 
Somniel. Planning to arrange them for a picture."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Your wyvern friend is wonderful, Rosado! 
What do you call her?"
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Rosado] 
Her name is Camille and we are inseparable. 
Isn't she a beauty?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
It's unlike you to be in such a rush, Saphir. 
Where are you off to?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Saphir] 
Summons from Prince Diamant. He's caught an 
enormous fish and wants some help cooking it."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
I had no idea your culinary skills were in such 
high demand. Consider me impressed!"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
Hehe, I grew up in a fishing town, so I'm good 
with seafood. With anything else, I'm hopeless."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Not training today, Saphir?"
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Saphir] 
Nope. Today's a rest day. Gotta give the 
muscles time to recover, y'know."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Saphir] 
The front lines of a battle can get pretty rough. 
Keep behind me if you need to, OK?"
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I'm used to leading troops from the vanguard. 
I'll be fine."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
This is the first time anyone's read my fortune! 
Well? What do you think this grail card means?"
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Seadall] 
Le Roi du Graal─the King of Sangrails─speaks 
to your nature. It says, ""You are deeply kind."""
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
It also says, ""You tend to the wellbeing of 
others, but push yourself too hard"""
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
I don't mean to. But I will try to take better 
care of myself. Thank you, Seadall."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Your dancing... How should I put this... It feels 
as if each step is filled with kindness."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
No one has ever told me that. Your Sacrifice 
ability is filled with kindness too, Micaiah."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
There is so much grace in the way you dance, 
Seadall. I could never move like that."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Seadall] 
Please, allow me to teach you. One day, you 
may want to dance with someone special."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alcryst] 
My brother is one in a million. Strong, wise, 
kind... He's truly a wonder to behold."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Oh, but, Alcryst...you're a wonder as well."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Me?! No, no─I'm just leftover scraps compared 
to Diamant."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Your strong, wise, kind older brother disagrees. 
Would you add ""lying"" to that list of words?"
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Alcryst, you should try and step back and better 
appreciate your skills. Can you do that for me?"
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
But if I do that, I might realize I'm even more 
pathetic than I thought... I can't risk it!"
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Alcryst] 
I hope I don't let you down too badly, Lady 
Micaiah. I'm nothing compared to my brother..."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
You remind me of someone. But you're more... 
I suppose ""strong-willed"" is the polite phrase."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Amber] 
I've been wondering, Micaiah... Don't you ever 
get cold? Your clothes look so light!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
That's not a problem for Emblems like me, but 
I appreciate your concern."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Amber] 
Well, if you ever feel cold, I'll get you a sweater 
from home. They're made from alpaca wool!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
Oh! Thank you, Amber. I may not feel the cold, 
but your kindness never fails to warm my heart."
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Amber] 
They say the Solmic desert is home to a rare, 
orange bird that can bring people joy. Is it true?"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Oh, I very much hope so! I love birds. We should 
go searching for that legend together someday!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Amber] 
Micaiah! Is it true that you have extra powers 
beyond being an Emblem? That's so, SO cool!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I can see glimpses of the future...but not all of 
them are pleasant or ""cool."""
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
Oh, Vander, you dropped something! 
Is that a knitting needle?"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
Ah, that's... Well, it's maybe a little 
embarrassing."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
You knit? What a fantastic hobby to have. 
You must show me your past works!"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Vander] 
Oh, it's just something to keep my hands busy, 
but your excitement is appreciated."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Vander] 
Do you enjoy apples, Lady Micaiah? I have such 
an appetite for them."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Why, they all look delicious! I wish I could taste 
one, but the scent alone is lovely."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Vander] 
What is to be done? The Divine Dragon always 
puts others first, never taking a moment's rest."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I don't know... Such dedication is one of the 
Divine Dragon's loveliest qualities."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Veyle] 
I sense a familiar loneliness in you. Why is that? 
You don't seem like someone who'd be alone."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Oh, I was alone once, for a very long time. 
I lived in the shadows, hiding a secret."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Micaiah] 
But I met someone important to me, and my life 
changed. He saved me from the darkness."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
I see. I met someone who changed everything 
for me too. We have a lot in common, don't we?"
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Veyle] 
You have a little brother, right? I've wondered 
what it's like to have a younger sibling."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Ah, well, we aren't actually related. But there 
isn't anything I wouldn't do for him."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Veyle] 
I have to make up for all the bad things I've 
done. Will you help? Will you fight beside me?"
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Oh, Veyle. Of course I will. You are one 
of us now."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Yunaka] 
You keep giving me this goofy smile. Am I really 
that funny?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
It's not that. You remind me of someone. 
He was very dear to me."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
What about me reminds you of him? Is he 
great at impressions or something?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
It's your walk. You're so light on your feet that 
it's easy to lose track of your footsteps."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You keep peering at me from the shadows, 
Yunaka. It's a little unnerving."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Sorry. I could say it's because you're pretty, but 
the truth is...keeping lookout's just an old habit."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Now that I've turned over a new leaf, I intend 
to devote myself entirely to you, Micaiah!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Micaiah] 
No need for any of that, Yunaka. I'm glad 
you were the one to find me."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Zelkov] 
My yearning for *purpose* continues unabated. 
I need a reason to go on living."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Micaiah] 
I wish my power could heal your pain."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
Your *sacrifice* can mend the body. 
My struggle is in the mind."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Micaiah] 
I know. I can only pray you'll be at peace 
one day."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 

[Zelkov] 
A sleeping draught would do much to quiet the 
world's misery. I should *devise* one."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Micaiah] 
Hmhm! Try a nice herbal tea."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Micaiah] 2 
[Micaiah] 
You're very driven, Zelkov, but even the most 
diligent workers need to rest now and again."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
I have no need for *rest.* Not when there is 
more to be done."
