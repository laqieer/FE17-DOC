[Leif] 
Relax 
[Leif] 
I have been waiting, . 
Are you prepared?"
MID_BT1_#002,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
Of course, Leif! I will face you anywhere, 
at any time."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Leif] Strike 
[Leif] 
Then let us begin. A fair battle between equals."
MID_BT2_#001,"[Leif] b 
[Leif] 
Angry 
[Leif] 
Be honest with yourself. What do you want? 
What do you hope for, deep in your heart?"
MID_BT2_#002,"[Ivy] t 
[Ivy] Pain 

[Ivy] 
But I... What if I fail again?"
MID_BT2_#003,"[Leif] 
Smile 
[Leif] 
Life is not a simple path, and mistakes are only 
mistakes. Set them right by making amends."
MID_BT2_#004,"[Leif] Normal 
[Leif] 
You have faced your own weaknesses before. 
Do so again and you will only grow stronger."
MID_ED1_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You have become stronger since first we met, 
my friend ."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
I feel like I still got a long way to go. 
I appreciate your guidance."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Leif] 
Guidance? An interesting word choice."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Leif] 
I believe I understand now why the trial was 
located here."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alear] 
Oh? Why?"
MID_ED1_#006,"[Leif] 
I was a young prince, inexperienced in leading 
an army. My errors were many. Some fatal."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Leif] 
On the day of this battle, I was told something 
I have kept in my thoughts ever since..."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Leif] 
Once blood is spilled, it cannot return to its 
source. Make that sacrifice worth something."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Leif] 
. Life is a series of choices."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Leif] 
There is no way for one to know if their past 
choices were correct or a mistake."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Leif] 
All we can do is make the future into something 
good and righteous. We must strive for that."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Leif] 
Such is the responsibility of a guide. And it is 
what I learned in the place so like this one."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Leif, for sharing your story with me. 
I feel like I understand more than before."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Alear] 
I will work to build a good future. And you'll be 
beside me until the end of this war?"
MID_ED1_#015,"[Leif] 
Here, on the shores of this beautiful river, 
I swear my service to you, ."
MID_EV1_#001,"[Leif] b 
[Leif] 
Angry 
[Leif] 
I will stand my ground. No running. No hiding. 
Now, come at me!"
MID_EV2_#001,"[Leif] b 
[Leif] StandBy 
[Leif] 
Now! Destroy the bridge!"

[Alear] 
Something about this place is really off..."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Leif] 
It appears to be the River Thracia. Quite similar, 
at least."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
Is this someplace in your world?"
MID_OP1_#004,"[Leif] 
In looks, it is quite close enough to a stretch of 
ground where I once stood."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Leif] 
The River Thracia was a beautiful, broad river. 
And it was the site of much bloodshed."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Alear] 
I can't imagine someplace as serene as this 
turning into a battlefield."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Leif] 
This is where I faced the genius tactician Saias. 
Some thought him a hero."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Leif] 
Reinhardt, a powerful man said to be the 
crusader Thrud reborn, was there as well."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Leif] 
It was a difficult battle. Many were the moments 
when I thought defeat was at hand."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Alear] 
So why does this place look like that?"
MID_OP1_#011,"[Leif] 
I do not know for certain."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Leif] 
I sense a mighty force emanating from here. 
This must be the trial appointed to you."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Alear] 
A...trial?"
MID_OP1_#014,"[Leif] 
. I want you to fight me here."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Leif] 
If you overcome that trial, our bond will 
grow stronger."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Leif] 
That bond will bring with it power we cannot do 
without if we are to survive the battles ahead."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Alear] 
Winning a battle against you is my trial? 
Understood."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Leif] 
Good. Victory is your only way forward."
