[Goldmary] 
The cook-off was a delight, Saphir. I'm... I'm 
actually proud to say we were evenly matched."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Saphir] 
Yeah, it was great. Can't complain about a tie 
with a skilled chef like you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
Tight as the competition was, though...that 
wasn't the best part."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
That honor goes to all the smiling faces 
we got to feed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Goldmary] 
I have to agree."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Goldmary] 
The crowd seemed to be so worn down before 
we got started."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Goldmary] 
But by the time we were finished, they were 
completely revitalized."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Saphir] 
Yeah. We did a good thing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Goldmary] 
I have to say, Saphir, the way you handled our 
contest truly moved me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Saphir] 
How so?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Goldmary] 
The only reason I was able to cook at all was 
because you shared your catch with me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Goldmary] 
If not for your generosity, I would have been 
a laughingstock."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Goldmary] 
And even though you could have humiliated me, 
you didn't say another word about it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Saphir] 
Hahaha! Are you kidding? I could say the same 
thing about you, y'know."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Goldmary] 
I don't see how."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Saphir] 
Those herbs of yours were a key ingredient in 
my dish. I couldn't have made it without 'em."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Saphir] 
And you didn't say another word about that, 
did you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Goldmary] 
Hehe!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Saphir] 
What's so funny?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Goldmary] 
It's just very unlike me to refrain from 
saying something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Goldmary] 
Normally, I'm the sort of person who would 
take credit for those herbs."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Goldmary] 
But in this situation... Well, I guess you could 
say I was inspired by your good deed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Saphir] 
That's really touching."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Goldmary] 
I'd love it if we could do this again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Goldmary] 
I don't mean as a competition. Let's just cook 
up another feast for people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Saphir] 
Sounds great. We should branch out from 
seafood next time too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Saphir] 
I'll be in unfamiliar territory, though, so you'll 
have to give me a few pointers."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Goldmary] 
I'll be happy to teach you a few tricks."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Goldmary] 
Maybe then you'll be able to say I inspired you 
as well."

[Saphir] 
Here we are. Ready to cook some fish?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
Well..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Not exactly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Saphir] 
Hey, what's wrong? I thought you were 
gonna grind me to dust."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Goldmary] 
Ashamed as I am to admit it...I wasn't able to 
get my hands on any decent fish."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Saphir] 
No? That's a shame. Look what I caught─as 
rare a specimen as you'll find in these parts."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Goldmary] 
The competition hasn't even started, and I've 
already lost."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Saphir] 
Not at all. Look, I caught one for you too."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Goldmary] 
Why would you do that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Saphir] 
Wouldn't be fair otherwise. It's a cook-off, 
not a fishing contest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Goldmary] 
That's true..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Goldmary] 
Thank you, Saphir. This is a noble gesture. 
I'm humbled by your kindness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Goldmary] 
But as much as I want to win this competition, 
I can't let you outshine me in nobility either."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Goldmary] 
So...please take this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Saphir] 
What have we got here?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Goldmary] 
Rare herbs. They were hard to come by, but it 
would be poor form not to share them now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Saphir] 
You weren't kidding─these are tough to find! 
Hehe, thanks, Goldmary. You're all right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Saphir] 
Now, let's get cooking! May the best chef win."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Goldmary] 
Agreed. You're going down."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Saphir] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Hello, Saphir."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I heard you're good with fish. Is that true?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Saphir] 
Yep. You heard right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Saphir] 
Been fishing ever since my dad first took me out 
on the water. Been cooking 'em about as long."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Saphir] 
If it's got gills or flippers or tentacles, I can 
cook it to your preference."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Goldmary] 
I see. Even uncommon ingredients like squid 
or octopus are within your purview, then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Saphir] 
They sure are! I once caught this massive thing. 
A real whopper. Don't even know what it was."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Saphir] 
But that didn't stop us from cutting it up and 
making a huge feast for the whole village."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Goldmary] 
That is quite a story. You must be exceptionally 
skilled."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Goldmary] 
That is why I must destroy you utterly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Saphir] 
Whoa, hey! Why the hostility?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, Saphir, but there is only room for one 
perfect chef here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Goldmary] 
I challenge you to a singular contest of 
culinary skill."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Saphir] 
You mean, like...a cook-off?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Goldmary] 
That's right. We'll showcase our talents and let 
others decide which of us is superior."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Saphir] 
Sure, I guess this might as well happen."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Goldmary] 
Good. I will tell you when and where as soon as 
it is decided. Be ready to cook some seafood."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Goldmary] 
And look forward to being ground into dust 
and used for seasoning."
