[Fogado] 
Here's your lunch. Extra pickles, just the way 
you like it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Clanne] 
Wow, this looks delicious!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
Now, for the secret I promised. See, there's this 
guy I admire. The kind of person I want to be."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Fogado] 
I'm gonna say what I like about him, and that'll 
tell you what you need to know."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Clanne] 
I'm all ears. Please, tell me everything."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Fogado] 
This guy's a really hard worker. He's always 
thinking of ways to improve himself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Fogado] 
And he never, ever gives up. Exactly the kind of 
positive attitude that the world needs right now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Clanne] 
Huh. He sounds like an inspiring person to 
be around."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Fogado] 
Yes, inspiring, exactly. He makes me want to 
follow in his footsteps─always strive for better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Clanne] 
Who is this guy? Is it someone I know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Fogado] 
I think so. He's here, writing something in his 
notebook."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Clanne] 
You mean he's somewhere nearby? Or..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Clanne] 
Wait, what?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Fogado] 
I know you look up to me, but the truth is... 
I look up you too. Maybe more so."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Clanne] 
WHAT?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Fogado] 
Listen. This stuff about being a boy, being 
a man, all that? None of it matters."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Fogado] 
You're better off if you stop worrying about it 
and do your own thing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Fogado] 
And your positive, hardworking attitude? 
That's a pretty great thing...if you ask me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Clanne] 
I... Wow. That's really nice of you. I don't know 
what to say."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Clanne] 
I'd better put in double the effort so I don't 
let you down!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Fogado] 
Uh-oh. Then I'll be twice as impressed. I think 
at that point my head might explode."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Clanne] 
Hmm... I guess this is what they mean by 
bringing out the best in each other, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Fogado] 
I'd say so."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Fogado] 
Come on! Let's have some food. You gotta eat if 
you want to be a big, strong Clanne."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Clanne] 
Don't mind if I do!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Fogado] 2 
[Clanne] 
Thanks for letting me shadow you today!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Fogado] 
It was no trouble at all. Did you gather any, uh, 
useful data?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Clanne] 
Tons! I have several pages of notes on the best 
ways to prepare and eat various tropical fruits."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Fogado] 
Oh. Uh... OK. Not sure I'd call that useful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Fogado] 
Can I take a look at this notebook of yours?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Clanne] 
Sure! I hope it's not too hard to read. My 
handwriting gets...sloppy when I'm excited."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Fogado] 
Let's see here."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Fogado] 
""Fogado is a man of the people. He's so 
approachable, you forget he's actually a prince."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Fogado] 
""He leads the Sentinels with a steady hand... 
He likes parties...loves gourmet food..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Fogado] 
""He is good at all sports, except fishing."" 
Hahaha! Tough but fair!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Fogado] 
Hm, you got me to a T. Guess you don't think 
I'm anything special anymore, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Clanne] 
What?! If anything, I'm even more awestruck! 
You're a man among men!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Clanne] 
But I didn't learn anything that'll close the gap 
between us. Feels like it's only getting wider..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Fogado] 
You really think that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Fogado] 
OK, here's an idea. Let's you and me get 
lunch sometime."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Clanne] 
Lunch, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Fogado] 
Yup. I'm gonna let you in on a secret that busts 
this whole thing wide open."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Clanne] 
Really? Prince Fogado's secret to manliness, 
finally revealed..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Clanne] 
I'll definitely be there. I can't wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Fogado] 2 
[Clanne] 
Prince Fogado, I have a question."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Fogado] 
Yeah? Go ahead! Lay it on me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Clanne] 
What do you eat for breakfast?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Fogado] 
Huh. Somehow that's not what I expected."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Clanne] 
Please? I would really like to know."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Fogado] 
Hm, OK. Usually I eat some tropical fruits."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Clanne] 
I see, I see. Do you eat them fresh, or prepare 
them in some way?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Fogado] 
Clanne, why are you interrogating me about my 
breakfast choices?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Clanne] 
Oh, uh... Well...I guess there's really no point in 
beating around the bush."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Clanne] 
People treat me like a boy, but you? You're the 
dictionary definition of a man!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Fogado] 
Aaah, thanks! I think."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Clanne] 
You're not much older than me, so...there must 
be something you're doing that I'm not doing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Fogado] 
Hence the question about what I eat 
for breakfast."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Clanne] 
Right! If it's not too much trouble, I'd like to 
follow you for a bit─learn more about you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Clanne] 
By studying you up close and personal, maybe 
I'll learn the secret to manliness!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Fogado] 
Sure, why not? Sounds kinda fun!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Clanne] 
Thank you, thank you! I promise you won't even 
notice I'm here."
