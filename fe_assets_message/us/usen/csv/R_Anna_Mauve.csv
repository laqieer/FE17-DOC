[Anna] 
There you are, Mauvier! You gonna buy 
something from me today or what?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Anna] 
What's the matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
I was praying."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Anna] 
Praying? To who?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Mauvier] 
I do not know. No one? I was just sending out 
a prayer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Mauvier] 
I was intrigued by your own prayer the other 
day and wished to try the practice for myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Anna] 
No kidding?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Mauvier] 
I never imagined I would feel this way 
when praying."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Anna] 
You don't pray much, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Mauvier] 
I was a follower of the Fell Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Mauvier] 
I would pray every day...and feel nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Anna] 
Oh. So you did pray, but it was just going 
through the motions."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Mauvier] 
Yes, exactly. My parents were devout believers 
in the Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Mauvier] 
But our family was destroyed by an epidemic. 
Praying did no good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Mauvier] 
So even though I prayed, I never understood 
what it was I truly believed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Mauvier] 
You showed me praying is not only for worship. 
It can be a means to think warmly of others."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Anna] 
Yeah, that's how I see it too. I'm glad someone 
else gets it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Mauvier] 
Thank you for teaching me this feeling."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Anna] 
Oh, quit being so stiff. Hey, what did you pray 
for anyway?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Mauvier] 
There is someone I would give my life to 
protect. I was praying for them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Anna] 
Wow... That's real sweet of you. I wonder if 
anyone will ever pray like that for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Mauvier] 
I prayed for you as well, Lady Anna."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Anna] 
What? Really?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Mauvier] 
I prayed you would be always healthy and able 
to sell your wares with a smile."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Anna] 
Hahaha, nice!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Anna] 
I've got just the thing to thank you with! You 
really liked that fruit, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Mauvier] 
Yes... But do I not owe you some payment?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Anna] 
Nah. It's free today, on account of it being the 
anniversary of me being so touched."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Anna] 
Take the gesture and get outta here, 
you cheapskate!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Mauvier] 
Well, thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Mauvier] 
Since it is a special day, we should share 
this fruit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Anna] 
Yes! These are pretty expensive, so I don't get 
many excuses to eat them myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Mauvier] 
I suspected that might be the case. Let us eat, 
and perhaps discuss other prayers as well."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Anna, the fruit I purchased from you was tasty."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Anna] 
Hmph. It's Lady Anna, not Anna. Address me 
properly or take a hike!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Mauvier] 
Lady Anna. I would like to buy another piece of 
fruit, if I may?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Anna] 
You sure may! But give me a minute while I say 
my prayers first."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Mauvier] 
Prayers? I did not know you to be religious."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Anna] 
Oh, no. I'm not the least bit religious, but I do 
pray sometimes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Mauvier] 
I do not understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Anna] 
Hmm...how do I explain this? Well, I'm about to 
pray right now, so just watch me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Mauvier] 
Fine then. Please go ahead."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Anna] 
Ahem..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Anna] 
Please... All I want is for my products to sell 
well again today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Anna] 
For my customers to be satisfied...even happy, 
at least for a little while."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Anna] 
I ask that they remember me the next time they 
need something."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Anna] 
That should do it! So yeah, that's the kind of 
thing I always pray for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Mauvier] 
Huh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Anna] 
What's up?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Mauvier] 
I admit that I had written you off as a small-time 
scam artist..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Mauvier] 
I never imagined you prayed with such passion."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Mauvier] 
And...I am embarrassed to admit that I looked 
down on you, Lady Anna. I must apologize."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Anna] 
Aw, no need for all that. C'mon, let's see about 
that fruit, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Anna] 
Congratulations, big guy! Anniversaries like this 
don't come around every day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Anna] 
You should buy something to celebrate. It's a 
steal with my special anniversary discount!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Mauvier] 
Hm? The anniversary of...what, exactly?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Anna] 
Aw, don't play coy with me! I think you know 
just what I'm talking about."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Mauvier] 
I do not. I have not the slightest idea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Anna] 
But how could you not know? It's your 
anniversary!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Mauvier] 
That explains nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Anna] 
Think hard! I bet it's on the tip of your tongue. 
C'mon, you're getting close."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Mauvier] 
I have no idea what you are talking about."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Anna] 
No? Too bad. Guess you won't be getting my 
special anniversary price on this fruit after all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Mauvier] 
Suppose it is the anniversary of an important 
event in my life. How would you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Anna] 
Psh! No need to get hung up on details like that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Mauvier] 
The odds are in your favor that any given day is 
special for someone you're trying to sell to."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Anna] 
Aw, tipped my hand there, did I? Oh well."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Anna] 
Let's just call this the anniversary of the time 
we talked, and I'll sell you the fruit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Anna] 
How does half-price sound? Are you really 
gonna haggle with a poor little girl?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Mauvier] 
You are a bold salesperson of dubious morals. 
Still, I admit I am impressed. I shall buy the fruit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Anna] 
Yes! Chalk up another sale for me. Thanks for 
your business!"
