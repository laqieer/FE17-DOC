[Saphir] 
Oh wow."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Saphir] 
This tea takes me back. Something about the 
taste, the smell... It's so familiar."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Louis] 
That is because I looked into what sorts of teas 
are popular around your hometown."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
That explains it. But why go to the trouble?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Saphir] 
It's not like this tea's anything special compared 
to what you can get in Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Louis] 
You carry with you painful memories that never 
fade, though you dearly wish they would."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Louis] 
I have seen you struggle with these memories 
time and time again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Louis] 
Now, I cannot banish them for you. I haven't 
that sort of power."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Louis] 
I suspect that no one does."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Louis] 
But lately, I had a thought..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Louis] 
Painful memories are not the only ones that 
can be tenacious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Saphir] 
I see what you're getting at. And you might 
be onto something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Saphir] 
As soon as I tasted this tea, so many memories 
came rushing back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Saphir] 
A field my friend and I raced through. The trees 
we sat under to talk and trade dreams."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Saphir] 
My father, sailing off to fish. My mother's face 
while cooking dinner. Three of us at the table..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Saphir] 
Happy times. I'd almost forgotten them, but... 
They've always been there, haven't they?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Louis] 
Just so."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Saphir] 
Maybe that's what I'll dream tonight. If I do, it'll 
be thanks to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Louis] 
I am glad to have been of service."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Saphir] 
Something else to think about, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Saphir] 
These happy memories we've made together 
will stick with me forever too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Louis] 
I believe my memories of you will be equally 
long-lasting, Saphir."

[Saphir] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Saphir] 
Gotta say, Louis..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Saphir] 
I didn't expect a cup of tea to put me so at ease. 
Weirdly enough, though, it has."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Louis] 
I'm pleased to hear it. I'd be delighted to make 
tea for you anytime you wish."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Saphir] 
Appreciate it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Saphir] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Louis] 
Another sleepless night?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Saphir] 
Yeah. I've got this recurring nightmare."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Saphir] 
Reliving the time my parents and best friend 
were...killed in front of me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Louis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Saphir] 
Soldiers from Elusia attacked the fishing village 
I grew up in. I was just a kid."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Saphir] 
It happened decades ago, but I can still see it 
like it was yesterday."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Saphir] 
I hoped it would fade as I got older. Or get 
easier to deal with as I got stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Saphir] 
Neither has panned out. I'm starting to think I'll 
be stuck with that memory forever."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Louis] 
This cannot be easy for you. I offer my 
deepest sympathies."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Saphir] 
Nice of you to say, considering how awkward 
I've made your teatime."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Louis] 
Not at all, Saphir. Feel free to talk to me about 
anything you like."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Louis] 
Alas, all I can do in return is listen and pour 
the tea."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Saphir] 
That'll do just fine. Thanks, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Louis] 1

[Louis] 
Hello, Saphir. Would you like to join me for tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Saphir] 
Tea? Yeah... No, thanks."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Saphir] 
I'm not the best company for small talk right 
now. Better find someone else."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Louis] 
You do seem more solemn than usual today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Saphir] 
You noticed that...and invited me anyway. Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Louis] 
Well, tea can be quite soothing, you know."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Saphir] 
Hahaha, or maybe you're just nosy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Saphir] 
Still...thanks. For noticing, I mean."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Louis] 
What is on your mind, exactly?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Saphir] 
Nothing important."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Saphir] 
I...didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Bad dream."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Louis] 
How dreadful."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Saphir] 
Feels ridiculous saying it out loud. I'm not a kid 
anymore. Shouldn't be bothered by nightmares."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Louis] 
Not so. Even the strongest among us can be 
greatly troubled by them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Saphir] 
Maybe you're right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Louis] 
Are you sure you wouldn't like me to put on 
some nice, warm tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Louis] 
It may not drive away your nightmares, but it 
could ease your mind somewhat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Saphir] 
When you put it like that, I guess I may as well 
accept your invitation."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Louis] 
As I hoped you would."
