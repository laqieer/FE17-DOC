MID_GR_Alfred_A_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Alfred? I thought you were taking part in the 
war council today."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
Yeah, but it's deadlocked right now. I came out 
to get a few reps in and collect my thoughts."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
You're our national Emblem, after all. We've got 
to come up with something to make you proud."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Celica] 
That's very sweet, Alfred. Heh, Maybe I could 
join you on a run!"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Alfred, it's barely dawn. Why are you awake 
so early?"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
It's patrol time for me, with my daily jog coming 
afterward. Wanna come along?"
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Alfred] 
Who knew our kingdom's ring had such a 
trusty Emblem? I'm glad I get to meet you."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Celica] 
And I you, Alfred. We'll both be needed in this 
push to bring peace to the world."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Anna] 
Feast your eyes, Celica! I've come up with a 
new product."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Celica] 
Oh? What is it?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Anna] 
Set the log here, roll a stone down this groove, 
and the axe at the other end does all the work!"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Celica] 
That's...one way of cutting wood. But it would 
probably be faster to chop it yourself."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Hey, Anna─sorry, Lady Anna. Did you find any 
leads on the location of your family?"
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Anna] 
No luck yet. But I'm not worried. I'm sure 
they're all doing fine!"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Anna] 
In honor of meeting you, I'm holding a special 
sale today. I'm gonna rake in the cash!"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Celica] 
Oh, what a cute little shop! You've gone to so 
much trouble that I have to have a look."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Bunet] 
This dish is just the same as any dish from this 
world. I'm sorry, Celica. I tried, but I have failed."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Celica] 
It's OK. It's not easy to re-create a dish from my 
world with nothing but my verbal instructions."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
I want to make a dish that reminds you of home. 
Surely you'd be happy to see such a thing."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Thank you, but just spending the time working 
on it together has made me more than happy."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Your chef skills are incredible. I can't eat the 
food you make, but I love watching you make it."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Bunet] 
I'm happy to hear that, Celica. For dinner, I'll 
be sure to serve something beautiful to behold."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Bunet] 
Your ring─the way it's set with a stone─it looks 
like candy. Hm, I wonder if it tastes like candy..."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Celica] 
You might choke on it if you try to find out. 
So, let's just let it remain a mystery, shall we?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Boucheron] 
It's rare for you to ask me favors. Is something 
troubling you?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I heard there was a lovely forest and wanted to 
see it. But it's quite far, and I can't go alone."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Sure, I can put on the ring and take you. I've 
wanted to see it myself, but I get lost so easily."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Then you handle the walk, I'll handle the 
directions, and we'll both have a lovely time."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Boucheron] 
You know what I wish I could do? Go to your 
world and read all its stories."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Celica] 
I'm not sure how you'd get there, but I could 
at least tell you the ones I know."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Oh no... You look like you've been crying. 
Did something terrible happen?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
It's just this book that's been moving me to 
tears. But thanks for worrying about me."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Céline] 
Each day I have to speak with you is a joy 
unto itself, Celica."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Celica] 
That's very kind of you to say. I feel the 
same way."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Céline] 
The only drawback is that I sometimes fear I'll 
never be happier than I am now."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Don't worry about that. I believe there are much 
happier days than this in store for us all."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Today's tea smells captivating. Where is 
it from?"
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Céline] 
A farming village known for its single-origin tea. 
It's a favorite of mine, so I'm pleased you like it."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Céline] 
For all I had hoped to discuss with you, now 
that you are before me, I am lost for words."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Celica] 
I know what you mean. But we'll have plenty of 
time to get to know each other."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Chloé] 
Celica, can you tell me anything about the food 
in your world? Specifically the folk foods."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Celica] 
We had our own signature dishes, if that's what 
you mean. I was fond of dagon fillet."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
Dagon fillet?! Just the name sounds incredible. 
What kind of food is that?"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Celica] 
It's a slice of a sea creature native to Zofia. 
One bite is enough to chase away any fatigue!"
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Chloé] 
The sight of royalty and Emblems joining forces 
never fails to brighten my mood."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Celica] 
It is an inspiring sight, isn't it? You and I are 
starting to make an effective duo."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Chloé] 
You're so adorable, Celica. Like you stepped 
right from the pages of a fairy tale."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Celica] 
Thank you for the compliment, Chloé. I would 
say the same is true of you as well."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Citrinne] 
You're skilled at magic, right, Celica? Could you 
teach me? I'll repay you with any gift you'd like."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I'd be happy to teach you, but I don't need any 
payment. That's how our dynamic works."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
Our dynamic? Hehe, I hope I'm not presuming 
too much. Are you saying we're close friends?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Not presumptuous at all! That's precisely what 
I was saying. I'm always happy to help you."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Citrinne] 
My resting scowl made another child cry. I wish 
my face wasn't so frightening..."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Celica] 
They're just not used to you yet, Citrinne. Deep 
down, I'm sure they know how sweet you are."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Uh... Excuse me, Citrinne? You're staring at me 
so intently. Can I help you with something?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Oh! I was just admiring your dress. We seem to 
have similar tastes. Who's your designer?"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Clanne] 
You're so kind and warm and reliable. You're 
almost like an older sister to me."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Celica] 
Hehe, an ""older sister""?"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
Oh no. Did I say that out loud? Oh no..."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Relax. I'm happy to have a little brother. 
It makes working together more fun."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Clanne? What's in that jar you carry 
everywhere?"
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
Pickles! They're the best thing. I eat them for 
breakfast and they wake me right up!"
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Clanne? Why are you so far away? Come over 
here and chat with me."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Uh, me? Talk to Lady Celica? Alone?! Oh, wow, 
I think I might faint..."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Diamant] 
I'm so thankful you've joined our fight, Celica. 
You don't even have a connection to our world."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I wouldn't say I have no connection. It feels as 
if being summoned to Elyos was my destiny."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
In that case, I hope you'll see the destiny of 
Elyos through to the end."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Of course, Diamant. We'll bring peace to this 
world as quickly as we can."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Diamant] 
How did governing work in your world, Celica? 
I'd appreciate an outside reference."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Celica] 
I wasn't raised as a princess, so I don't know 
very much. But I'm happy to share what I can."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Diamant] 
It's an honor to fight beside an Emblem of 
Firene. Can you share any advice on combat?"
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Celica] 
The honor is all mine, Diamant. I'm happy to 
advise you however I can."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Etie] 
If you did want muscle, though, could you build 
any? Being an Emblem and all?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I've never tried it, so I can't say for sure."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Etie] 
If you could, then you'd be able to work out 
with me. You should give it a go!"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Celica] 
That sounds fun! Even if nothing comes of it, 
I'll enjoy spending time with you."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Etie] 
You're so dainty, Celica. I'd think a royal would 
want a bit more muscle on the bone."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Celica] 
I don't see how royalty factors into it. Maybe 
serving under Alfred has colored your thinking."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Oh, what a pretty flower! Where did you find it?"
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Etie] 
That field of flowers just over there. I picked 
it while I was out running."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Fogado] 
You Emblems don't grow old, do you? If I didn't 
age, I would travel the world for centuries."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Celica] 
Yes, but we can't move as freely as you. What 
would you do when you finished traveling?"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
All kinds of things, but mostly I would just go 
around meeting new people. That's always fun!"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Celica] 
I see why so many people like you, Fogado. May 
you spend centuries meeting wonderful people."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Fogado] 
I wonder if the fighting will end soon. There are 
so many places I want to visit when it does."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Celica] 
Traveling sounds lovely, doesn't it? I hope we 
can all go on some fun trips together one day."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Fogado] 
I know I'm laid back and all, but as it turns out, 
I'm actually a prince, in case you didn't know."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Celica] 
Ah, I see. I have had to hide my social status 
before, but you're much better at it than I was."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Framme] 
Um, Lady Celica? What would I have to do to be 
as elegant as you?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Celica] 
That's nice of you to think I'm elegant, Framme, 
but I think you're lovely the way you are."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Framme] 
But I'm not─not at all! Everyone gets annoyed 
at me for being so gawky and unrefined."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Celica] 
No, everyone loves you for being full of energy. 
So you just keep being wonderful you."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Framme] 
Guess what, Lady Celica. Today I got to train 
with the Divine One!"
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Celica] 
You sure do adore the Divine One. Seeing how 
happy that makes you makes me happy too."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Framme] 
I have so many questions for you! What's your 
favorite food, your favorite color, your favorite..."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Celica] 
Haha! OK, calm down, Framme. I can answer 
everything if you ask one question at a time."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I'm curious, Celica. Are Emblems able to bathe?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I'm not sure. Without a physical body, it's never 
occurred to me to try."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Perhaps we could try going to a hot spring 
sometime. You might enjoy it."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Yes, that sounds nice. If nothing else, I think 
I would enjoy the atmosphere of such a place."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Already done for the day, Goldmary? Most of 
the others are still training."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
No need to overdo it. I've already perfected 
my form."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if I upstaged you too much in the last 
battle, Celica. I know I can be intimidating."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Celica] 
That's...OK? Don't worry about it."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Hortensia] 
We know each other well enough by now that I 
feel like I can ask... Have you ever been in love?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I have, as a matter of fact. He's strong, brave─ 
makes you feel like you can handle anything."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Aww, you're gushing! Hehe, you sound 
completely smitten. It's kind of adorable."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Ask a mushy question, get a mushy answer!"
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Hortensia] 
You always seem so calm and collected, Celica. 
Don't you ever get angry?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Celica] 
Of course. Thugs and bullies who cause trouble 
for innocent people make me furious."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Your charm may rival my own, Emblem Celica, 
but I will not be outclassed so easily."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Celica] 
You don't need to compare yourself to me, 
Hortensia. Your charm is totally unique."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Ivy] 
I used to think trust was hard to come by, but 
you have proven yourself to me time and again."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I'm glad to hear you trust me. Thank you."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
If you'll go on lending me your power, I promise 
to do all I can for both our countries."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Celica] 
I will always be there when you need me, Ivy. 
I swear it in Mila's name."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Ivy] 
You are a princess as well, are you not? Both of 
us were born to carry heavy burdens, it seems."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Celica] 
True. But if not for that, I wouldn't have 
become an Emblem, and we'd never have met."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Ivy] 
The way you Emblems glow and float around... 
You're not actually ghosts, are you?"
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Celica] 
Hehe, I don't feel like a ghost, but now that you 
mention it, I don't know."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Jade] 
Our chats have inspired me, Celica. I've been 
writing a new story... May I tell you about it?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Celica] 
Of course you may! I always love to hear what 
you're working on."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Jade] 
It's about a hero who awakens in another world 
with the power to defeat a mysterious threat."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Oh, how harrowing...and so interesting! I'll have 
to read this story when you're done."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Where do you find inspiration for all of your 
novels, Jade?"
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Jade] 
I people-watch, mostly. Reality is much, much 
funnier than it gets credit for."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
I heard you write novels, Jade. May I read 
them sometime?"
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Jade] 
Huh? Oh, I'm sorry, Celica. I was meditating. 
What were you saying?"
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Good work, Jean. You had so many patients to 
treat today that it must have worn on you."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Jean] 
Thanks for thinking of me. But it was probably 
much worse for my patients."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Jean] 
If I was a better doctor, I could treat them faster 
and more effectively."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Celica] 
They have their lives, and that's what counts. 
You have to take care of yourself too."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Jean] 
I should have done better today. Why can't 
I just get it right?"
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Celica] 
The battlefield can be scary even for veteran 
fighters. Don't get too frustrated with yourself."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Jean] 
Celica? Are you injured, or─ Oh. I guess you're 
an Emblem, so it can't be that."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Celica] 
I'm fine, don't worry. But I heard you're a very 
skilled doctor, so I thought I'd watch you work."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
If we borrow the Divine Dragon's power, we can 
face each other in mock combat, yes?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Celica] 
Yes, I believe so."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
Then let us do so right away! I long to test my 
skill against yours!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Celica] 
If you insist. Let's not forget that we're friends 
though, all right?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
You remind me of an old friend. Looking at you 
makes me nostalgic."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
This friend of yours resembles me, does he? 
I wonder if he could match my skill as well!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
I want to see what it is like inside your ring, 
Celica! How do I get inside?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Celica] 
Uh, I don't think that's actually possible. Sorry."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Lapis] 
Uh, excuse me, Celica. You look a bit down 
today. Did something happen?"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I'm fine. Sorry to make you worry. I just have a 
hard time watching you get hurt in battle."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Celica] 
Oh, listen to me. That's not a helpful thing to 
say, is it? Please, forget I even mentioned it."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
No, no─it's nice to know you care! I don't want 
you to worry...so I'll try to grow much stronger."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Lapis] 
Aren't taters great? You only need one to grow 
a ton! Or, uh, so I've heard. Or read. In a book."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Celica] 
Potatoes can also grow in barren soil, right? We 
grew oranges in my home village. I miss that."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Lapis? Why do you have that log?"
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
I think I might use this to make some shelves. 
Let me know if you'd like some too, Celica."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Lindon] 
The world is in a sad state indeed if it needs 
a retired old man like me to save it."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Celica] 
You've seen so much that you must have a 
good perspective on building a peaceful world."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
I have seen a lot, it's true. Here's hoping I live 
long enough to see the world you speak of."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Celica] 
It's not necessarily for you. You cleared the 
path, and now it falls to them to walk it."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Do you have any new experiments planned 
for today?"
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Lindon] 
No experiment, just my tried-and-true method 
for making pastries using magic."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Lindon] 
So, you're an Emblem, are you? If you have 
time, I'd love to learn more about your world."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Celica] 
You seem like you'd be a good person to teach 
me about this world too."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
You've seemed a little distant lately. Did I do 
something to offend you?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Louis] 
Not at all, Celica. I'm as fond of you as ever."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Celica] 
Then why do you keep your distance? I only 
know you're present when I talk to others."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Louis] 
To intrude in that way would be to take a brush 
in hand and ""improve"" on fine art. I would never."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Louis] 
There's nothing I find as moving as seeing two 
friends getting along. Wouldn't you agree?"
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Celica] 
It is a beautiful thing to see others make friends. 
But I've also enjoyed making friends with you."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
I'm starting to get used to the way you fight. 
We make a good team."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Louis] 
I concur. I look forward to introducing you to 
all my friends."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
The Brand on my right hand is a sign of my 
Zofian royal lineage."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Alear] 
It's a simple design, but a pretty one."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Celica] 
I have somewhat mixed feelings about it, but 
we're close enough that I wanted to show you."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Thank you for showing me this. I'll do my best 
to be worthy of your trust."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Alear] 
What are you doing, Celica?"
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Celica] 
Offering a prayer to Mila. You're welcome to 
join me if you wish."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Alear] 
Will you help me bring peace back to this world 
as soon as we can?"
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Celica] 
Of course I will. I won't rest until it's done."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Mauvier] 
I failed in rejecting Lady Veyle's first offer of 
friendship. She suffered due to my hesitation."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Celica] 
Yes, but Veyle was only able to smile again 
because you were by her side."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
That is the work of yourself and the others. 
I have been unable to help her find happiness."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Mauvier, you are relied upon by Veyle, and the 
rest of us as well. Please, understand that."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Never has there been a time when I have known 
such peace."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Celica] 
I pray that one day this will be the norm for you 
and not the exception."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Lady Celica, is there anything that needs doing? 
It is rather awkward to simply be...resting."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Celica] 
Nothing at all. I'm here as your ally, not as 
your master. Please, take the time to relax."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Merrin] 
My older brothers, ugh, I'm so annoyed. I'm an 
accomplished knight for goodness sakes!"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Celica] 
It's not often I see you so angry, Merrin. 
What's going on?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
Ugh, Lady Celica! My brothers keep insisting 
they're worried about me! Worried about ME!"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Celica] 
That reminds me of my older brother. Just try 
to think of it as their way of saying, ""I love you."""
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Merrin] 
Did you see me in that last battle? I fought with 
every ounce of skill I have to make you proud."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Celica] 
Yes, you were incredibly cool, Merrin. 
Of course, I would expect no less from you."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Merrin] 
Lady Celica, as a sign of our new friendship, I'll 
let you pet my wolf's fur. It's quite soothing."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Celica] 
That's very kind of you, and I would love to, 
but...my hand would just pass right through."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Timerra] 
So, what kind of clothes were popular in your 
world? I want to hear all about the fashions!"
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I'm sorry, but I lived in a priory for a long time, 
so I really don't know much about those things."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
A priory?! Oh, well, what did you wear there? 
And what was living there like? I wanna know!"
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Celica] 
I'll tell you all about it. But only if you explain 
the fashions of this world to me in return."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Timerra] 
Ugh, I'm dying to go camping. I want to jump 
into an oasis and swim around so badly!"
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Celica] 
Oh my, you do seem worked up. Why don't we 
take a walk so you can burn off a bit of energy."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Timerra] 
♪Clothing is best when it's nice and thin. 
Soft and light and perfect for a swim.♪"
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Celica] 
What a fun little song. What is it called?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Is everything alright, Pandreo? You don't seem 
like yourself."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Pandreo] 
I'm sorry, I was just tending to a funeral. No 
matter how often I do it, I never get used to it."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Celica] 
You don't have to get used to it, Pandreo. It's 
OK to let yourself feel sad when times are sad."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
It's...OK? Thank you, Lady Celica. I really 
needed to hear that."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Is it prayer time for you too? Your god has got 
to be amazing to be worshipped by an Emblem!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Celica] 
No one religion is better than another. They all 
have their beauty. Now, let's pray for peace."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Pandreo] 
To fight beside someone as revered as you is 
just...just WOW! I think I need to say a prayer."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Celica] 
Hehe! Oh, Pandreo. Please, try to think of us as 
equals and as friends."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Panette] 
Ugh, I'm spittin' mad! I shoulda done so much 
better in that fight!"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Celica] 
Oh no! What happened to make you so angry?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Panette] 
My goodness! Celica! I do wish you would give 
me fair warning before drawing near."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Don't you get tired of pretending? It's OK, 
Panette. You don't have to be polite around me."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Panette] 
I dare say our enemies grow ever stronger. You 
must use your power to kick their butts, Celica."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Celica] 
All I can do is bestow my powers on others. But 
I'll gladly do it to defeat our enemies, Panette."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Panette] 
Good day, Celica. I see the weather is quite 
pleasant once again."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Celica] 
It is lovely, isn't it. It's just the sort of weather 
that makes me want to get out and about."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Rosado] 
The world would be such a peaceful place if 
only people put a higher value on cuteness."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Celica] 
How do you figure?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
There's nothing adorable about weapons or 
warfare, so people would lose interest in them."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Celica] 
What an interesting thought. Your perspective 
on this is fascinating, Rosado."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Rosado] 
I'm looking to draw another portrait. Who do 
you think should be my next subject?"
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Celica] 
So hard to say. Everyone has a unique charm 
worth capturing."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Rosado] 
You're adorable, Celica. Would you mind if I 
captured your beauty in one little drawing?"
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Celica] 
With a compliment as sweet as that, how could 
I mind? Draw me as much as you would like."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Saphir] 
Something I don't understand. How did you get 
such immense strength when you hate fighting?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Celica] 
It's true I dislike fighting─but a desire to protect 
people motivates me to be strong."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
Not as big a contradiction as I first thought. 
Yeah, I can respect that."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Thank you, Saphir. That means a lot to me."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
I heard there's a place nearby that's rich with 
medicinal herbs. Would you mind taking me?"
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Saphir] 
Always thinking about how to help folks, huh? 
Yeah, sure. Let's go."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Saphir] 
You've got an air of strength about you, Celica. 
I appreciate that."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Celica] 
That's not something I hear often. Thank you."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Seadall] 
You must be bored watching me dance, Celica. 
Why don't you join me from time to time?"
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Celica] 
I appreciate the invitation, but honestly, I'm 
worried I won't be very good."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
You have nothing to worry about if you let 
your heart lead you through the steps."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Celica] 
Well, if that's all it takes, Seadall, then I think 
I will join you in a dance."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Oh, Seadall, why aren't you eating with 
everyone else?"
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
I am careful about the food that fuels my dance. 
It can be hard for some to understand, I know."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Seadall] 
So, what did you think of the dance? I tried to 
make it worthy of someone such as yourself."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Celica] 
It was enthralling! I was entranced before I 
knew it. Your reputation is well earned, Seadall."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
You showed our enemies an impressive display 
of power in that last battle. Well done, Alcryst."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
That can't be true! Please, just forget I'm here. 
I should crawl under a rock where I belong..."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Celica] 
It is true, Alcryst! After all, it takes real skill to 
wield the powers of an Emblem like me."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
That's so kind of you. Thank you, Lady Celica. 
I'm not sure, but...I think I feel a bit happier."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
There you are, Alcryst! Your brother was 
looking for you earlier."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Oh! Thank you for letting me know... I'm so, so 
sorry you had to go to all this trouble for me!"
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Alcryst] 
I know I'll be safe in your capable hands, Celica, 
but I'm sorry you're stuck with a waste like me."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Celica] 
That's not the least bit true, Alcryst. I'm glad to 
fight beside you. Let's combine our strengths!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Amber] 
If the legend of the Emblems was true all along, 
then every other legend must be true as well!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Celica] 
They might be! This world is full of mysteries."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Amber] 
You agree with me, Celica?! Whoa! That's great! 
Come on, let's go search for some legends!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Celica] 
What? You're going right now? And taking me 
with you?! How very...Amber of you, Amber."
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
You haven't missed a single day of training, 
Amber! That's the sign of a great attitude."
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Of course! Legendary heroes aren't built in a 
single training session, y'know. I'm going for it!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Amber] 
Hey, Celica! I know this comes out of nowhere, 
but...do you like alpacas?"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Celica] 
A-alpacas? I'm sorry, but...what are alpacas?"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
What are you doing, Vander?"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
Oh, it looks like you've caught this old man 
knitting his time away."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Celica] 
I think it's fascinating to watch your hands as 
they work. Do you mind if I stay?"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Vander] 
No bother at all. You're welcome to join me for 
as long as you would like."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Someday, I'd like to lay flowers at Lumera's 
grave. Would you help me?"
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Vander] 
Of course. The sentiment will surely please 
Queen Lumera."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Vander] 
I admit that, in all my years, I never imagined 
fighting alongside Emblems."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Celica] 
It's fascinating how our lives can follow a path 
that we didn't realize we were following."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Veyle] 
Thank you so much for lending me your 
strength, Celica. Now, what can I do in return?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Celica] 
You don't need to do anything. I'm just happy 
to spend time with you."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
But that's not enough. Please, tell me what 
I can do for you."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Celica] 
OK... Go, find your happiness. And then, find 
even more happiness. That is all I could want."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Veyle] 
All the people here are such good people. 
I've never had friends like this before, ever."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Celica] 
Oh Veyle, it must feel so good to have them 
now. And please, know that I'm your friend too."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Celica] 2 

[Veyle] 
Celica, I hope it's OK if I ask you this. Do you 
think I'm...scary?"
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Celica] 
No, I'm not scared of you, Veyle. To me, you 
are just like the rest of us─you are one of us."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Talking to you is always interesting, Yunaka. 
I've picked up so many new words and phrases."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Oh no. Have you been taking notes?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Celica] 
Yes. You have so many expressions that I never 
would have heard in my world. I enjoy them!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
Celica, no! You're toying with powers you 
don't understand!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Yunaka] 
That's a fancy looking weapon you've got there, 
Celica. Mind if I take a closer look?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Celica] 
Not at all─but I'm not sure whether it will 
measure up to your exacting standards."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Where are you off to, Yunaka?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Yunaka] 
What?! Nowhere! OK, maybe somewhere. 
How did you know I was up to something?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Thank you for showing me the candles you've 
made. You have such a wide variety of skills."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 
No need to *thank* me. All of this is purely 
for the sake of killing time."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Celica] 
The results are impressive nevertheless. Your 
crafts are as lovely as I've seen anywhere."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Zelkov] 
If my pursuits make you *happy*...I suppose 
there are worse things."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
When you have some spare time, Zelkov, 
there's somewhere I'd like us to go."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Zelkov] 
I try my hardest *never* to have spare time, 
but we can make arrangements."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
Nothing like a bit of peace and quiet, is there? 
I relish these opportunities to relax."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Every word you just said is *anathema* to me."
