those creatures."
MID_ED3_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Diamant, she helped kill our father! Why are you 
making excuses for her?"

Princess Ivy's not to blame─her father was. 
And the Fell Dragon murdered him."

He spoke out of turn."
MID_ED3_#023,"[Ivy] 
No, it's all right. I am sorry that I couldn't stop 
the ritual."
MID_ED3_#024,"[Alcryst]

see him again."

MID_ED3_#037,"My mother told me that a Divine Dragon 
should never run away."

We're not running away. As Lucina said, we're 
retreating. There's a difference."
MID_ED3_#039,"[Alear]

MID_ED3_#040,"[Lyn] 
Time and again, you've shown true bravery, 
even in the face of daunting odds."
MID_ED3_#041,"But refusing to move on... That's not bravery. 
It's folly."
MID_ED3_#042,"[Lucina] 
There's courage. And there's stubbornness. 
Lumera would have taught you the difference."
MID_ED3_#043,"Unfortunately, in your short time together, 
she didn't have the chance."
MID_ED3_#044,"[Alear] 
Perhaps that's why Marth said what he did 
outside the cathedral."
MID_ED3_#045,"[Lucina] 
Probably so."
MID_ED3_#046,"[Alear] 
Now, at least, I understand."
MID_ED3_#047,"We're not running away─we're stepping back. 
Gathering our strength for the next battle."
MID_ED3_#048,I'll become a better fighter─a better leader.
MID_ED3_#049,"I'll make sure no one─not one more person─ 
loses their life under my command."
