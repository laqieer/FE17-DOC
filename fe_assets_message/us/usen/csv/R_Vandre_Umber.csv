[Amber] 
Urgh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Vander] 
Struggling already, hero? These are but core 
exercises. We have not even begun the sprints."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Amber] 
Ugh... I'm dyin' here, Vander. Do you always 
train this hard?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Vander] 
I do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Amber] 
This is unbelievable. I'm barely able to keep up!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Vander] 
Is this it? What happened to your enthusiasm? 
I thought you wished to become a legend!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Amber] 
Oh... I'm too tired to defend myself. Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Amber] 
If this is your routine, I'm pretty sure you're 
already a legend. Can I just have your weapon?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Vander] 
No! I told you, I have no interest in legendary 
weapons or being a legend myself. However..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Vander] 
I see how hard your generation is working to 
better the world. THAT is the stuff of legends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Vander] 
You are dedicated, driven, and show incredible 
potential. Your own story has just begun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Vander] 
Keep reaching for that dream. If you do, your 
weapon will soon belong to a true legend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Amber] 
Aw, Vander. I will!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Amber] 
My weapon will be legendary, and so will I! 
Just like the stories I used to read as a kid."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Vander] 
An admirable goal...and one you will achieve 
sooner if you stop complaining. Understand?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Amber] 
Yes, sir. I'll keep training as hard as I can!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Amber] 2 

[Amber] 
Hnh... Hah..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Not done yet... Have to...train more."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Vander] 
Well, well. How nice to see you working up a 
sweat at such an early hour, Sir Amber."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Amber] 
You bet. I've got to grow as strong as I can."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Amber] 
I have to become a legend, just like you said. 
Then my lance will be a legendary weapon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Vander] 
He took my brush-off seriously? He is either 
truly devoted...or a fool."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Amber] 
Hm? You say something?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Vander] 
I was, um, just wondering why you desire a 
legendary weapon so badly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Amber] 
I grew up in a dull country town. Nothing to do, 
nothing to see. Stories were my only escape."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Amber] 
My favorite was about this one hero who used a 
legendary weapon to defeat a giant monster."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Vander] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Amber] 
I think about that story all the time. I want to be 
a hero like that...so I need a legendary weapon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Vander] 
I see. If you are so dedicated, then...why not 
train with me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Amber] 
Really?! You mean it? I would love that!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Amber] 
You're so strong and cool-looking. I bet you do 
all kinds of crazy training."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Vander] 
Hmph. Just try to keep up. I will not hold back 
for your sake, ""hero."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Amber] 2 

[Amber] 
Hey, Vander. Where do you keep the legendary 
weapons around here?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Vander] 
Legendary weapons? What in the world are you 
talking about, Amber?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Amber] 
I've always wanted a legendary weapon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Amber] 
The Somniel seems to have lots of sacred spots. 
One of them must have a sword or something..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Vander] 
I do not waste my time on folklore and fluff."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Amber] 
Oh. So that's a no? Gotcha. I guess I'll just poke 
around and see if I find anything."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Vander] 
Actually...I suppose there is one surefire way 
to obtain a legendary weapon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Amber] 
Really?! What is it? How can I get my hands 
on one? Please, Vander! You've gotta tell me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Vander] 
Think. What is a legendary weapon, essentially?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Amber] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Vander] 
For a weapon to become a legend, a legendary 
hero must wield it first. Right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Amber] 
Huh... Yeah, I guess that makes sense."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Vander] 
Well then, Sir Amber, all you must do is attain 
the moniker of legendary hero."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Amber] 
A legendary hero? Me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Amber] 
Yeah. Yeah! If I pull that off, my trusty lance..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Vander] 
It would become a legendary weapon. Correct."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Amber] 
WHOA-HO-HO-HOOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Amber] 
Vander! You just blew my mind! I'm gonna do 
exactly that. My legend starts right now!"
