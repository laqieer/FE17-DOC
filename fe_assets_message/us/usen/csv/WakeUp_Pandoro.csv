MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,I'm sorry for waking you.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,"It's just that after a battle... After I've stained 
these hands of mine..."
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,prayer brings me comfort...
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004,even if it doesn't bring me forgiveness.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,"Divine One, please permit me to break 
this silence for a moment..."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,"Oh, sorry."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,I just felt the need to pray after battle.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,You don't mind?
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004,Thank you for understanding.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#005,Your kindness never ceases to amaze me.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,"It's so quiet here, as if all that fighting 
never happened."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,"Perhaps my prayers can reach the sky 
from here..."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,"can reach those who have gone on to 
become stars."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004,"We pray, please grant peace to all those 
lost souls."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,"Ah, Divine One."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,"Thank you for attending the party the 
other day."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,Thanks to you it was a total success and...
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004,Huh? What's that look for?
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#005,OK. Fine. But only because you asked for it.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#006,AROOO!
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,Divine One! AR-AROOO!
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,"Uh, so, at that party the other day..."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,you heard everyone howling.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004,Sometimes we just can't help it.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#005,I...hope that's OK.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,Hmm...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,"I'm so happy to be here, I want to howl."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,And the Divine Dragon seems to like it.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004,But it's so crass and unbecoming.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,Aaaah!
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,"I'm sorry, Divine One!"
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,Please forgive my forced enthusiasm!
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004,"You don't...have a confession booth in here, 
do you?!"
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,Divine One! AROOO!
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,Ugh.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,"That was weird, huh?"
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,It's just...
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004,sometimes this place makes me nervous.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#005,I'm sorry if I was rude.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,Woo!
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,No more snoozing for you!
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,I'm usually nervous here. But not today!
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004,"Nope. Still nervous. And now, disrespectful too."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,Oh! You heard all that?!
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,What was I about to say?
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,"Well, I was going to say, the prophecy turned 
out better than I imagined."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004,"I don't mean any disrespect. It's just nice we 
get to be friends."
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,"""When the dragon child rises from their slumber 
on the dais, saved the world will be."" Hm."
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,Sorry.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,I was thinking about that prophecy...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,and decided to come here.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004,I want you to know...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#005,it saved me. It really did.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,"I never believed that prophecy would 
come true like...this."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,"When the priest talked about the 
""dragon child""..."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,"I always pictured, you know, a small child."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004,But the prophecy actually turned out...
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,"Ah, I see you are awake!"
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,What a divine sight...
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,"As a cleric, I have no choice but to pray."
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,"I never thought the day would come that I'd be 
allowed to approach the altar."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,"Divine One, good morning!"
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,If you don't mind...
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003,I'd like to offer up a prayer.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,"So, I'm...supposed to wake the Divine Dragon?"
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,A frightening thought...but...
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,I mustn't let the Divine Dragon oversleep.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004,"Steel yourself, Pandreo... Ahem! Divine One!"
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,Gah!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,D-Divine One!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,I only meant to say a prayer.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004,"Pandreo, you party-loving fool!"
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,"I have purified my mind and body. Only now 
may I enter such a holy place..."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,Oh no.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,My purification rituals failed.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,"Forgive me, Divine One."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004,"This befouled follower never meant to offend 
your senses."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,What a beautiful altar.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,"Ooo, I could throw an epic party here."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,No!
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004,"I mustn't think such wicked thoughts or the 
Divine Dragon will sense them."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,Morning.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,"Come, it's time for battle."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,No matter how many lives I have to take...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004,I'll gladly face the judgment that awaits...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005,if it means protecting you.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,"Divine One, it's time to get up."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002,"A clear, beautiful day awaits."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,"Good morning, Divine One."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,"What do you mean I'm being too formal 
with you? We'll see about that..."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,"Good morning, to you whom I very much adore."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004,"I hope that will suffice, my dear Divine One."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,"It still feels like a dream, you know?"
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,"You, the Divine Dragon, gave me─ME─the 
Pact Ring."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,"Every time I look at it, I get so happy I think 
I might start crying."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,"Oh, I know I'll become a star in the heavens 
long before you do."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,"But you and I, we have a bond."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,"And I know my hand will hold your 
hand forever."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,You heard all that?!
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,"Hm, that's embarrassing."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,But when it comes to my feelings...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005,I don't want to hide them anymore.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,AROOO!
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002,"Ugh. It's still awkward around the 
Divine Dragon."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,I'm sorry.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,I just lose my cool whenever I'm here.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,"I can't help it. I have some very, very 
strong feelings."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,I hope you can forgive me.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,I mean...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,my own deity gave me the Pact Ring.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,"I can't just, you know..."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,be casual about it all of a sudden.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,"It's probably going to take some time to get 
used to. Like, maybe a lot of time."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,But I don't mind.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007,"I like that awkward squeeze I feel in my heart 
every time I think about you."
