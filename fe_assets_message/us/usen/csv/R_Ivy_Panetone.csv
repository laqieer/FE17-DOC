[Panette] 2 

[Panette] 
I cannot tell you how sorry I am for taking 
you to those ruins."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Ivy] 
Please, don't worry about it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Panette] 
I didn't even think to ask if you were afraid 
of ghosts. How horribly careless!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Panette] 
Please allow me to atone for my error. 
Whatever you need done, I will do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Ivy] 
You don't need to atone for anything. I'm fine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Ivy] 
I seldom need to go anywhere alone, so I've 
scarcely felt my new crippling fear of solitude."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Panette] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Ivy] 
The howling wind keeps me awake at night, but 
I've learned to scream myself into exhaustion."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Ivy] 
And so what if the creak of a floorboard renders 
me motionless for hours on end? I don't mind."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Ivy] 
I have accepted that the lifetime of fear I went 
through in a single day has scarred me forever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Panette] 
Oh, you poor woman! I am so very sorry!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Ivy] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Ivy] 
No, I'm sorry. I had to tease you a little."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Ivy] 
I'm fine, Panette. Really."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Ivy] 
I understand that you brought me to that place 
because you thought it would make me happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Ivy] 
Please don't worry about it ever again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Panette] 
Don't worry about it?! I put you through a 
terrible ordeal!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Ivy] 
Your intention was purely for me to enjoy it, 
was it not?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Panette] 
Well, yes, but─"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Ivy] 
That is what matters to me. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Panette] 
Oh... All right. If you are certain."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Panette] 
Do you think, despite this horrible blunder, 
we might still be friends?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Ivy] 
Of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Ivy] 
So long as you tell me where we're going ahead 
of time from now on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Ivy] 
And no more haunted places, please."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Panette] 
Hehehe, of course! From now on, 
we stay in the land of the living!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Ivy] 
Panette... Please explain yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Panette] 
I promised we were going somewhere special. 
Well...here it is!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Ivy] 
When I said that I'd like for us to be friends..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Ivy] 
I did not realize that would entail visits to 
ancient...decayed...ruins?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Panette] 
Precisely! Doesn't it make your heart quicken?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Ivy] 
Excessively so, I'm afraid."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Ivy] 
I feel as if a vengeful ghost could steal upon us 
at any moment."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Panette] 
I know! It is ever so charming."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Ivy] 
You find it...charming."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Ivy] 
Ghosts. You find the idea of ghosts charming."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Panette] 
Why, of course! I simply adore them!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Ivy] 
I suppose I ought to thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Ivy] 
This place is...special to you. For that reason, 
I appreciate your sharing it with me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Ivy] 
Unfortunately, people have a wide variety 
of tastes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Panette] 
Oh dear. You are not by any chance afraid of 
ghosts, are you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Ivy] 
I am, in fact, terrified to the very brink of 
my composure."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Ivy] 
The stain on the wall like a human silhouette. 
The handprints on the windows. The stale air..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Ivy] 
It is only by force of will that I remain here. 
Conscious. Not screaming."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Ivy] 
My dignity hangs by one last thread of decorum. 
The pride I take in my royal office."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Ivy] 
That thread is...about to snap. Yes, it will snap 
any moment now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Ivy] 
Even a princess is only human, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Ivy] 
So...with that..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Ivy] 
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Ivy] 

[Panette] 
Good heavens! Princess Ivy...slow down!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Panette] 
Hm... Hm Hmmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Ivy] 
Did you need something from me, Panette?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Panette] 
Ah, no. Why do you ask?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Ivy] 
You have been staring at me for some time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Panette] 
It's just that for a princess, you seem so... 
How to put this? Composed."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Ivy] 
Do I? It seems like a rather ordinary level of 
composure to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Panette] 
Really? But you are not bursting into song or 
dancing to and fro."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
Correct. I do not do those things."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Panette] 
Nor are you running around like a mad wolf or 
cramming prime rib down your gullet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Panette] 
You are simply...standing around. It was so odd, 
I could not help but stare."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Ivy] 
Perhaps you are merely unaccustomed to the 
standard and expected conduct of royalty."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Panette] 
I have offended you, haven't I? My deepest 
apologies."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Ivy] 
No─no need for that. I should not be looking 
for offense in others' customs."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Ivy] 
It's rather nice to speak with you, actually. 
My own retainers lack a certain...femininity."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Panette] 
Really? I enjoy your company as well."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Ivy] 
Good. Then, if it's all right with you, I'd like it 
very much if we became friends."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Panette] 
Of course, Your Highness! It would be 
my honor!"
