[Etie] 
HYAH! Ha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Etie] 
Phew... I call that a good day's workout."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Jade] 2 

[Jade] 
That did look impressive, Etie."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jade] 
Here. This is a first draft of the novel I was 
talking about earlier. I'd like you to read it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Etie] 
Are you sure?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jade] 
Yes. Sorry for refusing earlier. I didn't want you 
to read any of it until it was ready."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Etie] 
Makes sense. Let me see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Etie] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Etie] 
This all seems familiar."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Etie] 
It's about me, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Jade] 
To a degree. The main character is confident, 
independent, and doesn't like to burden others."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jade] 
She's also athletic. Physically strong. She's put 
in the work and she's proud of her body."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jade] 
A chiseled core wrapped in striking features. 
A daring figure that stands out on a battlefield."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Jade] 
I needed to observe someone with all of those 
qualities. That's why I was watching you, Etie."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Etie] 
Wow. Jade...I don't know what to say."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jade] 
I do often write ""goofy stories,"" so I thought I 
should challenge myself with something serious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Jade] 
To set this book apart, I needed characters that 
were believable yet charming."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jade] 
I thought you'd be a perfect fit, so I started 
taking notes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jade] 
Observing you helped me craft this character 
and build a story around her. Thanks for that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Etie] 
I didn't know you thought of me like that. 
I'm sorry for giving you such a hard time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Etie] 
Listen, I know it's not much, but...would you 
like to go on a jog with me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Jade] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Etie] 
We can talk things over as we go. Maybe you 
can use some of it...in your story."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Jade] 
So I have your permission to polish this draft 
and keep using you as inspiration?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Etie] 
You'd better! It's going to be a real page-turner."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Jade] 
Thanks, Etie. I'll do my best to do you justice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Jade] 
I do have one last request, though..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Etie] 
What's that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Jade] 
My regular readers have come to expect at 
least one or two pratfalls in my work, so..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Jade] 
At some point, the main character will need to 
flail and trip over herself. Are you OK with that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Etie] 
Uh...sure. Only once though. And write in that 
it doesn't hurt me...at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Jade] 
Heh, understood."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Etie] 
There you go. Something to look forward to. 
Now, let's go for that run."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Etie] 
Phew! Another great workout. I'm ready to take 
on the world!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Jade] 2 

[Jade] 
Mm-hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Etie] 
Whoa!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Etie] 
Uh, you startled me there, Jade."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jade] 
Sorry. I didn't mean to."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Etie] 
I've noticed you watching me since the 
other day. What's all this about?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Jade] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Etie] 
If you don't fess up, I'm gonna take this to 
Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Jade] 
W-wait. I'll tell you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Jade] 
I was watching you and taking some character 
notes for my next novel. That's all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Etie] 
Character notes? That's what you were 
mumbling about?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Etie] 
I wanna see these character notes, and I wanna 
see them now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Jade] 
No."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Etie] 
Yes!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Jade] 
No."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Etie] 
Why can't I see?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jade] 
Because."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Etie] 
Oh. I get it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Etie] 
I've heard rumors about this. How one of the 
Brodia retainers writes these goofy stories."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Etie] 
That's you, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Jade] 
I, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Etie] 
And now I'm a character in them, which is why 
you won't show me. Is that about right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Etie] 
You're writing me as all stuck-up and shrewish, 
I bet."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Jade] 
No. It's nothing like that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Etie] 
Don't lie to me. I see right through you. 
No making fun of me, got it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Jade] 
I would never..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Etie] 
Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Etie] 
Phew... That's enough for today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Jade] 2 

[Jade] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Etie] 
Oh. Hey, Jade."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Etie] 
Doing some night training? Attagirl."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jade] 
Oh, I'm not training."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Etie] 
No need to be so humble."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Etie] 
I mean, I see you here, like, every night."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Jade] 
No, I mean it. I'm not training."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Etie] 
Right, of course. You Brodians always gotta 
play it off."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Etie] 
""You can hardly call a quick session like this 
a workout,"" or whatever."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Etie] 
Someday I'll get on your level."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Etie] 
Sorry, what's that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Etie] 
What are you mumbling about?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Etie] 
You've gotta speak up, Jade!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Jade] 
It's nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Etie] 
Sure. If you say so..."
