[Etie] 
I meant to thank you for that thing you made. 
It's been great for my weight training."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Lapis] 
That's great, Etie. I'm glad you're enjoying it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
I actually feel a little guilty. You gave me all of 
those Firenese tea leaves to pay me back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Etie] 
Don't worry about it. Your Muscle Maximizer 
Mark III was worth the entire crateload."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Etie] 
By the way, what's that you're eating? 
Some kind of...potato?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Lapis] 
Ah! Th-these? Well, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lapis] 
OK. I'm actually from a small, country town in 
Brodia. We grow taters─er, potatoes there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Lapis] 
Sometimes my parents send me dried sweet- 
potato slices from the farm. They're so good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Etie] 
Dried potatoes? From a remote part of Brodia? 
Is that what I think it is?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Etie] 
The high-calorie, low-fat starch that's every 
musclehead's dream?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lapis] 
What? You've heard of these?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Etie] 
I had no idea where to find these things. 
I never thought they'd fall into my lap."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Lapis] 
Would you like to try one?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Etie] 
Are you kidding me? Yes!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Etie] 
Yum!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Etie] 
Just one delicious bite completely eased my 
muscle fatigue!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Etie] 
I might seriously cry, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lapis] 
Me too! I've never seen anyone else so in love 
with our homegrown potatoes! I had no idea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Lapis] 
Here, take some more! I have so many."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Etie] 
Are you sure you don't mind?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lapis] 
I don't mind at all!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Etie] 
You're too nice. I owe you so much for all this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Lapis] 
Well, in that case, may I train with you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lapis] 
I'm pretty strong, but I start to droop if a battle 
drags on and on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Lapis] 
I'd love to build up my endurance. Maybe we 
could go for runs together?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Etie] 
We can do that, no problem. For you, I'd jog 
until my legs gave out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Etie] 
We should try it with and without the potatoes 
to see if they make a difference!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Etie] 
Who knows what kind of heights we can reach 
together!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Etie] 1

[Etie] 
Lapis! How's that muscle-training device 
coming along?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Lapis] 
Oh! Hey, Etie! Good timing. I was just making 
some final adjustments."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lapis] 
Introducing...the Muscle Maximizer Mark III!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Etie] 
Mark III?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lapis] 
Yeah... It took a couple of tries to figure 
things out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Lapis] 
This one definitely holds up though. It'll work 
your arms, chest, core, and back."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Etie] 
Wow, it's as good as I dreamed! So what's it 
gonna cost me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lapis] 
Don't worry about that. I built this out of sticks 
and spare parts, so there was no material cost."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Etie] 
Sticks and spare parts?! Unbelievable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Etie] 
Well, I owe you for the labor at least. You've 
gotta let me pay you back somehow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Etie] 
But first...you mind if I try it out?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lapis] 
Go for it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Etie] 
Ugh... Ugh... Yesss!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Etie] 
The resistance settings are perfect! I can tell 
you worked hard to get it just right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Etie] 
This is exactly what I was hoping for!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lapis] 
Yay! I'm so glad!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Etie] 
It's so good that I have to wonder if you're into 
bodybuilding yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Lapis] 
Kinda, but nothing fancy. I just lift rocks...like 
that one. Or that big guy over there."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Etie] 
Those rocks? With your noodly arms?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Etie] 
How do you manage that? I can't picture it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Etie] 
You'll have to tell me more about it sometime. 
I have a feeling we're gonna be good friends."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Lapis] 
Really? I mean, OK! I'd like that a lot."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Lapis] 2 

[Etie] 
Hey, Lapis. Got a minute?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
Sure, Etie. What do you need?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Etie] 
They tell me you can build whatever you want. 
Is that true?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Lapis] 
What? How did you hear that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lapis] 
I mean, I guess it's true. With the right materials, 
I can make all kinds of stuff. Furniture, toys..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lapis] 
I even made some instruments for a local 
concert once. That was really fun."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Etie] 
That's amazing. Listen, I need a favor."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Etie] 
Would you build me a...muscle-training device?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lapis] 
Like workout equipment? Wow. I've definitely 
never built anything like that before."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Etie] 
For me, bodybuilding is life."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Etie] 
I've tried lots of training methods, but it's 
getting harder to achieve my goals on my own."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lapis] 
Oh, sure. I hate hitting that plateau where you 
feel like you're not making any progress."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Etie] 
Exactly what I'm saying! I knew you'd get it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lapis] 
Which muscles do you want to focus on?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Etie] 
Hmm. My arms, chest, core, and my back. 
That's all I'm looking for."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Etie] 
I'd repay you of course. Anything you want. 
Think you could do this for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Lapis] 
Yeah! It'll be a challenge, but a fun one. I'll see 
what I can put together."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Etie] 
Great. Oh, this is going to be incredible!"
