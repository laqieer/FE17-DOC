[Alear] 
Ah, there you are, Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
Do you recall when you said you weren't 
""worthy"" of my friendship?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
Yeah. I didn't think hard enough about your 
feelings, and I made a pest of myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Well, I disagree with what you said. You're my 
friend, Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
We ended up here because you were trying so 
hard to help me, which I do appreciate."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
So, please, don't ever say things like that again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alfred] 
Sorry, Divine One..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alfred] 
Everything I did was way off the mark. How 
could I possibly still call myself your friend?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
You already do so much for me, Alfred. Doing 
additional things isn't necessary."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
You know...you were the first friend I made 
after I awoke."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
It would pain me if my first friend didn't spend 
time around me anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alfred] 
Your first friend, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alfred] 
That's got a real ring to it! Thank you. 
I'd be honored."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alfred] 
I did feel close to you, y'know, even before 
you woke up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alfred] 
So when you finally did wake up, I was so 
excited that I went completely overboard."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alfred] 
But I'm through with all that. From now on, let's 
be plain ol' friends!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
I'd like that very much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alfred] 
Good. Oh! I have a great idea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alfred] 
As my totally regular friend, what do you say 
we do laps around the atrium together?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
Laps? As in, running? Right now?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alfred] 
No time like the present! Off we go!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alear] 
Now wait just a moment! I haven't even agreed!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alear] 
Alfred! Alfreeeeed!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Alfred] 2 

[Alear] 
Hi, Alfred. Do you have a moment?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
Sure do! Whatever you need─I'm all ears."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
I appreciate the beautiful breakfasts you've 
been bringing me in the mornings."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
But would you please stop making them?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alfred] 
Oh no! They've been too heavy on the meat, 
haven't they? I just wanted you to get strong."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
To be honest, they do have a ton of meat... 
But that's not why I'm bringing it up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
I just feel bad that you've gone out of your way 
to do this for me every morning."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alfred] 
Ah, I get you. Sorry about that. I wasn't out to 
make you feel bad."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alfred] 
I thought my friend would enjoy waking up to 
healthy, yummy breakfasts. But I'll cut it out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Alfred. There was one other thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
Every night, as I'm fading into sleep, I hear the 
haunting song of a flute..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alfred] 
Yeah! That's me playing a lullaby. Just making 
sure the Divine One gets a good night's rest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
Ah, I thought that was your silhouette outside 
my sanctum."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
Your playing is quite lovely, but I'd like for you 
to stop doing that as well. Please."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
The song continued into the late hours, and 
it started invading my dreams..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alfred] 
Oh no... I am so sorry! I had a hard time telling 
when you were asleep, so I just kept going."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alfred] 
I was only trying to help, but... Wow. This really 
didn't pan out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alfred] 
Maybe I'm not worthy of being your friend."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
That's rather extreme."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alfred] 
I always try to keep things light, but I feel awful 
right now. I need a jog to clear my head."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alfred] 
Sorry for the trouble, Divine One. I'm off for 
my run. Goodbye!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alear] 
Wait! Alfred..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Alfred] 
Morning, Divine One!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Good morning, Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
That's...quite the smile. Having a good day, 
are you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alfred] 
You can say that again!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alfred] 
I got up before sunrise and did tons of training. 
Even got an early run in."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alfred] 
And the cherry on top? I get to see your bright 
and shining face. What a day to be alive!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
There's no need to tease me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alfred] 
Who's teasing? Wouldn't you be just as happy 
to wake up to the sight of a friend?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
Well, yes. I do feel happy when I see my friends."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alfred] 
See? Me too!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alfred] 
But look, isn't there anything I can do for you? 
You've been awake a while, but it must be hard."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alfred] 
There's bound to be a lot you're still adjusting 
to. Tell your friend Alfred all about it!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
Let me think... Hmm. No, there's nothing 
bothering me at the moment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alfred] 
Good. Great. But if there is something, well, 
I want to be the first to know."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alfred] 
Before you left Lythos, you asked me as a 
friend to teach you things─to help you adjust."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alfred] 
And knowing you wanted to be friends just 
tickled me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Our friendship makes me happy too, Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Alfred] 2 
[Alfred] 
Good morning, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Good morning, Alfred. Is something troubling 
you? You look a little upset."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alfred] 
You could tell, huh? I'm dealing with a lot of 
emotions right now."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alfred] 
You know me─I act, then maybe I think. Not the 
other way around."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
Yes, I've noticed that in you. Once you have an 
idea, you run with it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alfred] 
But for the first time in maybe ever, I'm 
dragging my heels getting something done."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alfred] 
This time, if I act without thinking, I might end 
up destroying a perfectly good friendship."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alfred] 
Plus, I'd be going back on my word."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alfred] 
Remember when I said I wanted us to be plain 
ol' friends?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
Don't tell me you're back to feeling unworthy 
of my friendship again."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alfred] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alfred] 
I'm the crown prince of Firene. I can't be a 
coward when it comes to this of all things."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alfred] 
Plain ol' friends isn't going to cut it with me 
anymore, sorry to say."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alfred] 
Divine One? I want us to be closer than that."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alfred] 
I said I'd stop going overboard when it comes 
to you, but I can't help myself."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alfred] 
I even brought you this. See what I mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
The embroidery on this is exquisite."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alfred] 
It's an old Firenese tradition to pass down 
embroidered clothes through the generations."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alfred] 
This royal piece has been re-sewn so many 
times, it's taken on a completely new form."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alfred] 
Still, I have it, and I'm supposed to give it to 
someone important to me to show I care."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
Wow..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Thank you so much. I will happily accept 
your gesture."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alfred] 
Oh! Gosh. You're sure? It's not too much?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Alear] 
No, it's perfect. I feel the same way about you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
Thinking back, I've felt that way almost as soon 
as we met in Lythos Castle."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
Now I have something for you. Please, may I 
see your hand, Alfred?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Alfred] 
The Pact Ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Alear] 
We're going to be inseparable. I look forward 
to the journey ahead with you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Alfred] 
Thank you, ..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Alfred] 
I'm done holding back my feelings. I love you. 
You've made me the happiest man in the world."
