I remember how I felt when I stood on the field 
that day..."

[Alear] 
This is where your destiny branched, isn't it? 
I think I can understand what you went through."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Corrin]

[Corrin] 
Do not swing timidly without resolve. You must 
genuinely try to kill me!"
MID_BT1_#004,"[Alear] Strike 

[Alear] 
As you say, Corrin. I've chosen my path, and 
I'll travel as far as it takes me!"
MID_BT2_#001,"[Seadall] t 
[Seadall] Strike 

[Seadall] 
You saved my life before─I didn't expect us to 
end up fighting. The world is full of surprises..."
MID_BT2_#002,"[Corrin] b 
[Corrin] Surprise 
[Corrin] 
The fortune-teller didn't foresee this event? 
My, how very strange."
MID_BT2_#003,"[Seadall] 
Smile 

[Seadall] 
Tease me all you like, but I think knowing the 
result of this fight would be boring."
MID_BT2_#004,"[Corrin] 
Smile 
[Corrin] 
The future isn't set or planned. I control my 
own fate, as you do yours!"
MID_ED1_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Corrin] 
I expected no less from you, . 
You gave my blade, Yato, quite a workout."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
What a beautiful sword."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Corrin] 
It's a divine blade, forged to bring peace to 
the world."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Corrin] 
When I first saw Yato, it flew from its hiding 
place into my hands. It chose me."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Corrin] 
It was the same day my mother died 
protecting me..."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
Oh, you...lost your mother too?"
MID_ED1_#007,"[Corrin] 
It would have been easy to lose myself in that 
pain. I couldn't have recovered alone."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Corrin] 
Luckily, I had friends who stood by me and 
helped me find my way home."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Corrin] 
And, like my friends, Yato was by my side at 
every step on my journey."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
I understand your feelings...quite well."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Corrin] 
In the coming days, you'll make choices that 
might cause you no end of suffering."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Corrin] 
But no matter what pain you're feeling, I'm with 
you, and I'll help you find your way home again."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Alear] 
I will remember, even in the darkest moment, 
that I am not alone."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Corrin] 
Then you'll be just fine."
MID_ED1_#015,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Corrin, for joining me on this path 
I have chosen."
MID_EV1_#001,"[Corrin] b 
[Corrin] 
Are you ready? Then let's begin."
MID_EV2_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
Corrin can alter the terrain. I can't get caught 
unaware by her changes."
MID_EV3_#001,"[Corrin] b

[Corrin] 
I sense a draconic power underground. Is it... 
A Dragon Vein. I'll use that to my advantage."
MID_EV3_#002,"[Corrin] 
[Corrin] 
Relax 
Don't worry, though. I'm sure you'll be able to 
handle it!"
MID_LC1_#001,
MID_OP1_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Corrin] 2 
[Corrin] 
Is this... No, it's not. And yet, the similarities..."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Alear] 
What's the matter, Corrin?"
MID_OP1_#003,"[Corrin] 
This place looks very much like where my 
fate branched."
MID_OP1_#004,"[Corrin] 
I had three options that day. My decision meant 
abandoning two of my possible fates."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Alear] 
What do you mean?"
MID_OP1_#006,"[Corrin] 
In my world, there are two opposing kingdoms, 
Hoshido and Nohr..."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Corrin] 
I was born in Hoshido, but spent my childhood 
in Nohr."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Alear] 
Having ties on both sides of a conflict... That 
would be a hard way to live your life."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Corrin] 
Indeed. This is where Hoshido and Nohr faced 
off, and I had to choose which country to back."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Corrin] 
I had family and friends in Hoshido and in Nohr. 
I didn't want to abandon any of them."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Corrin] 
But as hard as it was, I had to make a decision."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Corrin] 
Hoshido or Nohr? Maybe neither, and I would 
fight alone. There was no obvious answer."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Alear] 
I don't know how I'd make such a big choice."
MID_OP1_#014,"[Alear] 
It's possible a significant one still awaits me at 
some point on our journey..."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Corrin] 
You've already decided to face the Fell Dragon 
and save the world. I'd call that a big choice."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Corrin] 
Now, let's see if your choice was a worthy one, 
. Face me in combat."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Corrin] 
The results will inform my next choice... Surely, 
our bonds will grow stronger."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Alear] 
I understand. The paths we've each chosen..."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Alear] 
I'm excited to find out what lies beyond the 
point where our fates meet."
