MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,"Hey, Divine One."
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,What flavor would you like for my next potion?
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,"I always prefer sweet, so I figured you..."
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004,Oh... Salty? Really?
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,"Divine One, there's something I want to talk 
to you about regarding herbs. Oh, asleep, eh?"
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,Sorry for waking you.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,I was off to get hold of a new medicine.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,So I thought I'd ask...
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004,"if there was anything you wanted while 
I was out."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,This new potion comes in five flavors.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,"There's sweet, sour, bitter, salty-sweet..."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,And the last one is...salty. Why salty?
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,Remember those medicinal herbs you picked?
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,"My parents wrote to say they were really useful 
to the village."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,They said to thank you too.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,"Divine One, how is your injury from before?"
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,I've come to examine your injury...
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,from when you were picking herbs for me.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,It looks to be healing nicely. Good.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004,Thank you so much for helping me out.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,There's not even a scar...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,"I'm relieved, but I'll still need to make sure you 
don't push yourself too hard again."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,I'll see what I can do.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,"Oh, you're awake, Divine One."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,You've been working hard lately.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,"I'll make you some delicious tea. It's a specialty 
from my hometown..."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004,so just relax while I brew it.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,Waking up the Divine Dragon...
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002,gives me a chance for a checkup.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,You woke up quickly this morning.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,"Your color's good, eyes focused, bed head 
minimal. Very healthy!"
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,"And as long as you're healthy, I'm happy."
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,Divine One?
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,Hmm... Not waking up quickly.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,Must be really tired.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004,"I'll make some tea to help with recovery 
from fatigue."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,I wasn't doing anything! At all!
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,"Good morning, Divine One."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,"Ooo, really nice weather we're having, huh? 
Well...anyway!"
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,"Pretty good harvest of medicinal herbs 
this morning..."
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,Sorry my wake up was late today.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,But herbs picked at dawn are more effective.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,So I wanted to gather them.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004,Would you like some?
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Herbs that are good for the skin, or help eyes 
to focus, or keep hair colorful..."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,There's even some to help you get more rest...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,"Hmm, what would happen if I administered 
those to the Divine Dragon?"
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,Oh! I almost dropped this potion on you!
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,Um... Good morning.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,I'm really sorry I woke you up like that.
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,Am I...really allowed in here?
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,"Oh, good. You're already awake."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,"Morning, Divine One."
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,This is a really beautiful room.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,I've got to be careful not to drop this potion.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,"If it stained, I don't know what I'd─ Ah!"
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,You're awake.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,Do you feel healthy?
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,That's good.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004,"If you ever feel lousy, call me. Immediately."
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,I heard the Divine Dragon won't wake up...
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002,So much sleep might hint at a medical issue.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,You look healthy.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,I was a little worried.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004,But I'm really sorry I woke you up.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Hmm, doesn't look injured, or ill..."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,"But you can't see most illnesses from 
the outside."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,"The Divine Dragon is so important, it's easy 
to worry."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,Did you hear me just now?
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,"Of course I'm planning on living even longer 
than a hundred years."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,So I hope we'll still see each other...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004,even when I'm an old grandpa.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,"Divine One, it's morning."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002,"Thank you for your faith in me, and for trusting 
me to help."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,Good morning. Even coming here to wake you...
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,feels totally different from before.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,Your offer of the Pact Ring made me very happy.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004,I'm really proud I have your trust.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,The Pact Ring makes me so happy.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,"Putting all this trust in me, even though I'm 
still young."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,"It makes me want to show you how much I 
can accomplish."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,"I'll become a doctor, and save people's lives, 
and..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,make it so everyone you love...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,will live for a hundred years.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning. Did you sleep well?
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,"Ah, that's good."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,As long as you always get a good night's sleep...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,and keep on being healthy...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005,I'll be very happy.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,I heard you were injured. Where? Show me.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,"Oh, I see."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,I'm glad you're not hurt.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,"I brought a lot of different medicines with me, 
just in case."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,But not having to use them on you?
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#005,Huge relief.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Ah, fast asleep."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,"Phew, I'm glad it was just a misunderstanding."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,"Still, it's really good that everyone comes to me 
about the Divine Dragon's health."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,"Oh... I wonder if that means they all know 
about the Pact Ring?"
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,"I never bragged, not even once..."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,"But it's pretty great to know other people 
noticed my work for the Divine Dragon."
