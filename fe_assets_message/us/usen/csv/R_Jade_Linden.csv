[Lindon] 
This was quite a welcome surprise, Jade!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Lindon] 
I had hardly put your last chapter down before 
you presented me with this new one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Jade] 
Well, now that you're reading my early drafts, 
each editing pass goes much more smoothly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lindon] 
Ah, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Jade] 
So? What did you think? Don't make me beg. 
Because I will."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Lindon] 
It was...magnificent."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lindon] 
I enjoyed this chapter even more than the last."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Jade] 
Ahh, that's such a relief to hear."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lindon] 
Especially that new fellow who debuts in this 
chapter! What a pleasant addition he was."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Lindon] 
He laughed, he cried... He felt truly alive! He 
might be my new favorite character of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lindon] 
I must admit, I felt a certain kinship toward him."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jade] 
I'm glad to hear that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jade] 
I hope you don't think it too presumptuous of 
me, but I did model that character after you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lindon] 
Aha! I had a hunch! What a wonderful feeling, 
to laugh along with your fictional counterpart."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Lindon] 
I now take his potent zest for life as the highest 
of compliments."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lindon] 
Again, thank you for letting me read your 
marvelous book, Jade."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Jade] 
The honor is entirely mine, I promise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lindon] 
I think I'll bake some pastries to thank you. 
You will have some, yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jade] 
Glowing praise and warm pastries? Twist my 
arm, why don't you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
My goodness, Jade! I do believe I nearly busted 
a gut with laughter, as the saying goes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Lindon] 
It's clear that you have a considerable talent for 
writing comedies."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Jade] 
That's high praise. Thank you, Sir Lindon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lindon] 
Your characters have so much life in them... 
They practically leap off the page!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lindon] 
How many of them are based on real people? 
A few of our mutual friends did come to mind..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Jade] 
I may have slipped in a few parallels to certain 
persons, living or dead."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Lindon] 
You have a keen eye for observation and a skill 
for capturing them on the page..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lindon] 
It was a magnificent novel, truly. I thank you 
again for sharing your passion with me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Jade] 
Of course. Thank you so much for reading it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Lindon] 
I have a bit of that fire myself, truth be told. I've 
chronicled my early years in a book of my own."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jade] 
You have?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lindon] 
Indeed. I haven't mentioned it to many people."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Jade] 
I would love to read it, if you wouldn't 
mind sharing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Lindon] 
Hohoho, wonderful! I hoped you might."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lindon] 
What a thrill it is, having a fellow writer among 
our ranks. I can hardly contain myself!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lindon] 
If and when you have the time, we should 
compare our lists of favorite comedies."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jade] 
Yes, please! I would love that!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Lindon] 
What a fortuitous meeting this has been. And 
here I thought nothing could surprise me..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
Ahh... HAA!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jade] 1 

[Jade] 
Sir Lindon? What are you doing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Lindon] 
Ah, Jade! Hello."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Lindon] 
I was just baking some pastries with thunder 
magic. I prefer them to be a bit...thundercooked."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lindon] 
Oh! My, my..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lindon] 
What is that book you're holding, I wonder?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lindon] 
I've read just about every book ever written, 
but I don't believe I recognize that cover."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jade] 
I would be amazed if you had."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Jade] 
This is one of my novels. I wrote it myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Lindon] 
Oh, my stars! How wonderful! Please, you must 
let me read it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jade] 
You want to read my book? I'll warn you, it's a 
bit lighter in tone than you might prefer..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lindon] 
So it's a comedy, eh? I see, I see. Well...that 
only deepens my interest."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Lindon] 
I could do with a refreshing rise in tone. Is there 
any way I could convince you to let me read it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lindon] 
What if I baked some pastries for you? Would 
that help to seal the deal?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Jade] 
No need for that, though I appreciate the offer. 
I would be honored just to hear your thoughts."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jade] 
Unless you don't care for it, that is. Then we'll 
both pretend we never had this conversation."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Lindon] 
Ah! So you will let me read it? Thank you, Jade!"
