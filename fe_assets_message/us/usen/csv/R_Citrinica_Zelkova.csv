MID_RELIANCE_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Zelkov! I can hardly believe it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Did you really send advice to every single 
person on that list?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
Yes, I *did.* It was no trouble."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Good work. They were all quite grateful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Zelkov] 
That is wonderful to hear...even if the errand 
failed to rid me of my *grief.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, dear. I'm sorry to hear that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Zelkov] 
However, I have been feeling somewhat more 
*optimistic* of late."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Citrinne] 
Truly?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Zelkov] 
Something *occurred* to me while I was giving 
counsel to these troubled individuals."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Zelkov] 
I realized they were, in their own way, each like 
a *bird* still learning to fly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Zelkov] 
My advice was focused on helping them manage 
on their own. To learn to *leave* the nest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Zelkov] 
Just like my *little* one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Zelkov] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Zelkov] 
It was helpful to *consider* that while writing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Citrinne] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Zelkov] 
I am *grateful* to you, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Citrinne] 
Whatever do you mean? It was you who did 
me a favor!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Zelkov] 
You asked for my help, *knowing* that it would 
assist me in turn."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Citrinne] 
Haha, I'm sure I don't know what you're 
talking about."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Zelkov] 
Heh, you are a wonderful person. Truly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Zelkov] 
Now then. I shall take my leave of you. It is time 
I began *searching* for my next pursuit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Citrinne] 
I know it will be lovely, whatever it is."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Zelkov] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Zelkov] 
One last thing, *before* I go."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Citrinne] 
Oh? What's that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Zelkov] 
Let us continue to pursue this friendship. It has 
become *important* to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Citrinne] 
Haha, worry not, Zelkov. I have no plans to fly 
away on you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Zelkov, how have you been?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Despite attempts to drown it in other pursuits... 
my loss continues to *consume* me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Citrinne] 
Ah... That's too bad."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Citrinne] 
I'm sorry to impose while you're feeling blue, 
but could you help me with something?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Zelkov] 
What do you *require*?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Citrinne] 
This. Give it a read."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Zelkov] 
""My son is a layabout. How do I convince him to 
put in some work?"""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Zelkov] 
""They say I need to cheer up, but they don't 
get it. My love's left me. How can I move on?"""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Zelkov] 
What *exactly* am I reading?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Citrinne] 
A register of young Brodians who need help. 
Letters from them or from their parents."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Why show this to *me*?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Citrinne] 
Sometimes to assist the royal family, I give 
counsel to those who are struggling."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Citrinne] 
There seem to be...rather a lot this time. 
I could use your assistance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Zelkov] 
Citrinne... Your *compassion* is extraordinary."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Citrinne] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Zelkov] 
Providing *counsel* to these people could be 
the pursuit that helps me move past my loss."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Zelkov] 
That *was* your intention, was it not?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Citrinne] 
Haha, you're giving me too much credit. 
I wasn't thinking that far ahead."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Citrinne] 
Anyway, how about you pick a person you 
think you can help and write them a letter?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Citrinne] 
They could benefit from an adult's guidance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Zelkov] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Zelkov] 
Yes. Yes, of course. I will *begin* immediately."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Done... It's done. Curses, what do I do now? 
How do I go on *living*?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Citrinne] 
Is something wrong, Zelkov? I can lend an ear, 
if you wish to discuss whatever it is."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Zelkov] 
That is very kind of you. But I doubt you would 
truly *understand.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Try me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Zelkov] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Zelkov] 
One of my *pursuits*...has come to an end."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Oh. You're broken up over a...hobby? I assumed 
it was something more serious."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Zelkov] 
The word ""hobby"" is insufficient to describe 
what is absolutely *paramount* to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Citrinne] 
I... I see. Apologies. Please, go on."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Zelkov] 
I had been *nurturing* a young bird."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Her parents had *abandoned* her. She had not 
yet learned to fly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Zelkov] 
I took it upon myself to *care* for her. In doing 
so, I became something of a foster parent."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Citrinne] 
Aww, how adorable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Zelkov] 
It is done, now. She has gone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Citrinne] 
She escaped?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Zelkov] 
She has left the nest. Taken her *rightful* place 
among the clouds."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Citrinne] 
Pardon me, but...isn't that a good thing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Zelkov] 
Yes. It was my *intention* from the start."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Zelkov] 
Indeed, as an instructor, I am *proud* to see her 
fly away all on her own."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Zelkov] 
But as a father, I am *consumed* by loss."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Zelkov] 
Do you understand my problem now, Citrinne? 
Do you have a *solution* for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Citrinne] 
Hmm... I could purchase a similar-looking bird 
for you to care for. Or hire a search party."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Zelkov] 
No, *that* won't do..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Citrinne] 
In that case, there likely isn't much I can do."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025,"[Zelkov] 
I understand. In that case, I will take up no more 
of your time. This will be my *burden* to bear."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026,"[Citrinne] 
I'm sorry, Zelkov. I wish there was something 
I could do to help."
