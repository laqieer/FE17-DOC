[Citrinne] 
Ha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Citrinne] 
No. This will not do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
I must practice and strengthen myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Only then can I protect those I care about."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Citrinne] 
Hyuh!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Chloé] 1 
[Chloé] 
Good shot! You were right on target."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Chloé? What are you doing here?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Citrinne] 
Are you lost?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Chloé] 
Nope. I know I shouldn't have, but I followed 
you to see what you were up to."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Chloé] 
Every time you have somewhere important 
to be, you come back covered in mud."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Aha. You were worried about me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Citrinne] 
I'm sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Chloé] 
Don't be."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Chloé] 
Now I know what the big deal was. You were 
getting in some extra magic training!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Citrinne] 
Yes, that's right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Citrinne] 
As I said, I became a retainer through filial 
connections. I lack the skill required."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Citrinne] 
I do some extra training every day to make up 
for that deficit─to build my strength."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Citrinne] 
I wasn't trying to keep these sessions a secret. 
I merely...avoid drawing attention to them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Chloé] 
I wish you'd just told me. Then I could've 
helped you out!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Citrinne] 
You would do that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Chloé] 
Sure I would. We're friends, aren't we?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Citrinne] 
Thank you, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Chloé] 
Besides, folk food tastes even better after a 
good bout of training. You'll see!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Citrinne] 
Hehe, is that right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Citrinne] 
Who knew there was a way to make fish guts 
taste even better!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Citrinne] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Hello again, Chloé. Is that folk food you're 
eating?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
Yep. This boiled frog is super good. You should 
try some!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Citrinne] 
Ah, no, thank you. I just had a rather large 
lunch."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Citrinne] 
Chloé. You came from money, didn't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Chloé] 
Yeah. My parents are nobles, anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Citrinne] 
We have that in common."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Citrinne] 
I am a noble as well─related to the royal family, 
in fact. I have never wanted for anything."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Citrinne] 
And yet..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Chloé] 
Hmm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Tell me. How did you become a retainer?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Chloé] 
Well, I took the knighthood exam, and then 
I passed, and then I got this job."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Citrinne] 
Wonderful. That means you possess the skills 
required of a retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Chloé] 
I don't know how it works where you're from, 
but you're a retainer for a royal family too."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Citrinne] 
I became a retainer not by virtue alone, but due 
to my family connections."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Chloé] 
And that feels wrong to you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Citrinne] 
If it were only a matter of wounded pride, 
I would not feel troubled."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Citrinne] 
But...my physical weakness could be a liability 
for His Highness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Citrinne] 
So...I can't help but dwell on it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Chloé] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Citrinne] 
Forgive me, but I must be going. I have 
somewhere to be once again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Chloé] 
All right. It was nice chatting with you. See you 
around, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Citrinne] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Why hello, Chloé. Fancy meeting you here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Chloé] 
Hi there, Citrinne. I'm just here picking up 
some lunch."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Chloé] 
You can only get it at this street stall, but the 
taste is worth the trip. It's my favorite."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Really? If it's as delicious as you say, I'd like to 
try some for myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Citrinne] 
Here. I'll treat you. Excuse me, sir? I'll take 
everything you have, please."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Chloé] 
The whole stock?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Don't fret about the money. This way, if we 
have extra, we can share with the others."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Citrinne] 
Thank you for wrapping all of that, sir. Here's a 
little more gold for your trouble."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Citrinne] 
Huh? Are these..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Chloé] 
It's folk food! Salt-pickled fish guts, in this case."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Oh. How, uh...charming."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Chloé] 
Oh, sorry. I love this stuff, but it might be too 
much for you to handle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Citrinne] 
No, no. One mustn't show prejudice toward 
food without trying it first."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Citrinne] 
Here, Chloé. Your portion."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Chloé] 
Wow, you're letting me have almost all of it. 
Thank you so much!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have somewhere 
to be."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Chloé] 
Must be important. You look pretty serious all 
of a sudden."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Citrinne] 
It is important. Well, to me it is. Take care."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Chloé] 
Will do. And thanks for treating me to a heaping 
helping of my favorite folk food!"
