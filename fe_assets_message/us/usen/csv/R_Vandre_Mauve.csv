[Mauvier] 
I have a request of you, Sir Vander."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Vander] 
A request? How intriguing. Let's hear it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
Would you tell me more of Queen Lumera?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Vander] 
Of Queen Lumera?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Mauvier] 
I wish to know as much as possible about the 
woman who died...because of me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Vander] 
So be it, then."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Vander] 
However, I have so many memories of Queen 
Lumera that it's difficult to pick one to share."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Vander] 
Ahh... Yes, that's the one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Vander] 
A piece of silverware─a fork, passed down the 
generations at Lythos Castle─was stolen."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Vander] 
A search for the thief revealed the fork was 
taken by a lady-in-waiting."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Vander] 
Before acting, I asked Queen Lumera, how to 
deal with the thief. She said to do nothing at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Vander] 
I said if the thief were not made an example of, 
then the guards' reputation would be tarnished."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Vander] 
I was deeply troubled at the time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Mauvier] 
And what happened?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Vander] 
The next morning, the fork had been returned 
to its proper place."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Vander] 
I never learned why she stole the fork, or what 
she hoped to do with it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Vander] 
But Queen Lumera understood the situation 
and solved it without effort or intervention."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Vander] 
That is the sort of person Queen Lumera was. 
Always kind. Always striving for peace."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Vander] 
She was a truly magnificent person, loved and 
respected by one and all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Mauvier] 
If only I could have known then the powerful 
regret that I would know today..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Vander] 
You protect people from harm. You're carrying 
out her will, whether you intend to or not."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Mauvier] 
I am happy that you feel that way, but I cannot 
yet agree."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Mauvier] 
How different life might have been had I met 
someone like you much earlier..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Vander] 
It may be late, but we have met, and that means 
you're on the right path."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Mauvier] 
I fear that not everyone will accept who I am."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Mauvier] 
Yet I swear to earn their trust as I have 
earned yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Mauvier] 
It is my duty to do so. For the queen."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 

[Vander] 
Back on guard duty today, I see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Mauvier] 
I feel more at ease when I work."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Mauvier] 
Of course, I apologize that my patrol may make 
your continued surveillance more challenging."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Vander] 
Indeed. You are making my life quite difficult."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Mauvier] 
My apologies..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Vander] 
Hahaha, I was joking! Goodness, now. I'm just 
doing my job, watching you do yours."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Vander] 
You do as you like. I'm not about to be 
prescriptive with how you handle your duties."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Mauvier] 
Sir Vander, what are your thoughts considering 
my past actions?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Vander] 
Well, which particular action concerns you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Mauvier] 
I am sorry about Queen Lumera. I am especially 
sorry it took me so long to speak these words."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Vander] 
What matters is that we are allies. I have no 
intention of dwelling on the past."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Vander] 
Were Queen Lumera here, she'd accept you, 
Sir Mauvier. Therefore, I'll do so in her stead."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Mauvier] 
You do not hate me for what I have done?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Vander] 
Why would I do that? To what end?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Vander] 
No point in going on with that attitude."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Vander] 
I've watched you long enough now to know that 
you're a good person at heart."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Vander] 
Keep in mind, your life will bring you plenty of 
opportunities to set things right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Mauvier] 
Sir Vander... I appreciate your concern for me. 
And also your advice."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Hm-hm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Vander] 
Mm-hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Mauvier] 
Sir Vander, you are following me. Explain 
yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Vander] 
You are a valiant guardsman, alert at all hours. 
The people could ask for no better protector."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Mauvier] 
Keeping an eye on me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Vander] 
Oh, just the one. It's nothing personal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Mauvier] 
Are you afraid I might switch allegiances again?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Vander] 
I wasn't saying that, no."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Vander] 
Alas, not everyone is convinced you are 
trustworthy as of yet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Mauvier] 
Understandable... There is much for which 
I must atone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Mauvier] 
I hope I might earn your trust, yet I understand 
your continued need for surveillance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Vander] 
It's not really surveillance, per se. I'm just 
watching from afar."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Mauvier] 
I am working diligently...so I may be worthy of 
everyone's trust."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Vander] 
Working hard is all well and good, but trust is a 
precious commodity. Harder to earn than lose."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Mauvier] 
Trust is a precious commodity. So I am aware."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Mauvier] 
Vander hates me as well. Quite understandable, 
given my actions towards Queen Lumera."
