I failed you, Prince Diamant. You will have to 
save the king without me..."

[Ivy] 
You've won... Please, kill me."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
No. I will not take your life."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Ivy] 
Don't be naive. If I live, what's to stop me from 
hunting you down?"
MID_ED1_#004,"[Alear] 
You can't return to Elusia after this. Your 
kingdom's through with you."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Ivy] 
What gives you that idea?"
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
If King Hyacinth had wanted you to survive, 
he would have given you an Emblem Ring."
MID_ED1_#007,"Besides, he had no need to stall us. The weather 
alone would have slowed us down."
MID_ED1_#008,"I don't understand it, but...the king used you. 
He never meant for you to survive."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Ivy] 
I suppose you're right."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
Your father has already sacrificed your life."
MID_ED1_#011,I won't do the same.
MID_ED1_#012,"[Ivy] 
You will not grant me the release of death. 
How cruel."
MID_ED1_#013,"But...you are my deity, and I respect your will."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Alear] 
Huh?"
MID_ED1_#015,"[Ivy] 
Could I ask you to forget that?"
MID_ED1_#016,"[Alear] 
All right..."
MID_ED1_#017,"[Ivy] 
In exchange, I offer information."
MID_ED1_#018,"I will tell you where King Morion is being taken, 
and why."
MID_ED1_#019,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_ED1_#020,"[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
Well? Out with it!"
MID_ED1_#021,"[Ivy] 
My father intends to perform a ritual that will 
restore the Fell Dragon's power."
MID_ED1_#022,"[Alear] 
A ritual?"
MID_ED1_#023,"[Ivy] 
You see, though the Fell Dragon has been freed, 
his abilities are diminished."
MID_ED1_#024,"Imprisonment drained him. He is exhausted and 
can't transform into a dragon."
MID_ED1_#025,"Ideally he would have all 12 rings, but securing 
them will take time."
MID_ED1_#026,"In the interim, Sombron decided to temporarily 
regain his powers through an ancient ritual..."
MID_ED1_#027,in which he consumes sovereign blood.
MID_ED1_#028,"[Diamant] 
You can't mean my father!"
MID_ED1_#029,"[Alear] 
But then King Morion..."
MID_ED1_#030,"[Ivy] 
Yes. My father took him as an offering to 
Sombron. That was his aim from the start."
MID_ED1_#031,"[Alear] 
That's horrific."
MID_ED1_#032,"[Ivy] 
The ritual will take place at Destinea Cathedral. 
You must hurry."
MID_ED1_#033,"And do be careful. Since the Fell Dragon's 
return, Father has not been himself."
MID_ED1_#034,"[Alear] 
I see..."
MID_ED1_#035,"[Ivy] 
That is the extent of what I know. Come, 
Zelkov, Kagetsu. Let us leave this place."
MID_ED1_#036,"[Alear] 
What are you going to do?"
MID_ED1_#037,"[Ivy] 
Whatever I can. Without taking sides."
MID_ED1_#038,"If we meet again, Divine Dragon... I pray it is not 
as enemies."
MID_ED1_#039,"[Ivy] 

[Alear] 
Let's head to Elusia."
MID_ED1_#040,"[Diamant] 
Yes, we have to hurry!"
MID_ED2_#001,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
The deeper we venture into Elusia, the worse 
this blizzard gets."
MID_ED2_#002,Is this the way to Destinea Cathedral?
MID_ED2_#003,"[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
I don't know. In this snow, it's hard to tell 
where we're going."
MID_ED2_#004,"[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
Gah... We don't have time to get lost!"
MID_ED2_#005,Hold on. I see someone up ahead.
MID_ED2_#006,"[Veyle] [Bandages] 1 
[Veyle] [Bandages] 
Hm? Is that you, ?"
MID_ED2_#007,"[Alear] 
Veyle!"
MID_ED2_#008,"[Diamant] 
You know her?"
MID_ED2_#009,"[Alear] 
She's a friend. Veyle, how did you get here?"
MID_ED2_#010,"[Veyle] [Bandages] 
I... I don't know."
MID_ED2_#011,"[Alear] 
You don't know how you crossed the border 
into another country?"
MID_ED2_#012,"[Veyle] [Bandages] 
Well, how about you? You look worried. 
Is something the matter?"
MID_ED2_#013,"[Alear] 
We're trying to reach Destinea Cathedral, 
but we got lost in the snow."
MID_ED2_#014,"[Veyle] [Bandages] 
If it's the cathedral you're looking for, head 
that way."
MID_ED2_#015,"[Alear] 
You know where it is?"
MID_ED2_#016,"[Veyle] [Bandages] 
Uh-huh. You're close. See the really tall tree 
over there? Use that as a landmark."
MID_ED2_#017,"[Alear] 
I appreciate your help."
MID_ED2_#018,"[Veyle] [Bandages] 
I owed you for patching me up the other day. 
That was so kind..."
MID_ED2_#019,"Huh. Were you wearing that ring 
before, ?"
MID_ED2_#020,"[Alear] 
Yes. It's very important to me."
MID_ED2_#021,"[Veyle] [Bandages] 
I didn't notice it the other day. It's pretty."
MID_ED2_#022,Really...pretty...
MID_ED2_#023,"[Alear] 
Veyle?"

MID_ED2_#027,Oh! I'm sorry! I'd better be on my way!
MID_ED2_#028,"[Veyle] [Bandages] 

[Alear] 
Where are you going? It's not safe!"
MID_ED2_#029,"[Alfred] 
She's gone."
MID_ED2_#030,"[Diamant] 
There's no time to search for her. Not when 
Father's life hangs in the balance."
MID_ED2_#031,"[Alear] 
You're right. Let's hurry."
MID_ED2_#032,Veyle... What in the world?

Your invasions of my country come at 
a very high price."
MID_MOVIE1_#002_2,"[Hyacinth] 
And now you will pay it!"
MID_MOVIE1_#003,"[Morion] 
Hahaha! Do you really think you can withstand 
the might of Brodia?"
MID_MOVIE1_#004,"[Hyacinth] 
Yes. My army is blessed by Lord Sombron himself."
MID_MOVIE1_#005,"[Morion] 
Damn you!"
MID_MOVIE1_#006,"[Morion] 
Heh..."
MID_MOVIE1_#007,"[Morion] 
Well then! Is that all the power your dragon's got?"
MID_MOVIE1_#008,"[Hyacinth] 
He is not yet at full strength."
MID_MOVIE1_#008_2,"[Hyacinth] 
Not until the ritual..."
MID_MOVIE1_#009,"[Morion] 
Ritual?"
MID_MOVIE1_#010,"[Hyacinth] 
The one by which we shall reignite his true glory."
MID_MOVIE1_#010_2,"[Hyacinth] 
And for that...we need a sacrifice of 
sovereign blood."
MID_MOVIE1_#011,"[Hyacinth] 
The blood thus offered..."
MID_MOVIE1_#011_2,"[Hyacinth] 
will be yours!"

he wants you to keep my ring safe."

Father wants a fair fight."
MID_OP1_#010,"Not to say that using the ring is unfair. But we 
Brodians have a particular sense of pride."

asked us to respect that."
