[Timerra] 
Panette, you said that without me, you would 
have spent your whole life lonely and resentful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
But I don't think that's true."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Panette] 
What makes you say that, Boss?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
Well, you were wild, sure. But your kindness 
always shone through."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Timerra] 
Even when we fought the worst of the worst, 
you didn't try to hurt them─just stop them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Timerra] 
And after our long, late-night rides? You took 
time to feed the wolves, brush their fur..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Timerra] 
The truth is, I didn't swoop in and put you on 
the right path. You were already there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Panette] 
Do you really think that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Timerra] 
Of course. I knew you were a good person. 
That's why I asked you to become my retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Panette] 
Huh, I remember that day. How surprised I was. 
I never suspected you were the princess."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Timerra] 
You weren't convinced by the princess-like way 
I begged you? ""Pretty please, be my retainer!"""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Panette] 
It just seemed absurd that a royal would want 
anything to do with a wild girl like me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Timerra] 
Well, I'm glad you agreed in the end. Thanks 
again for that, Panette."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Panette] 
Boss, please. It is I who should be thanking you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Timerra] 
Oh, come on. You think I don't know how hard 
you've worked?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Timerra] 
I know you were worried about embarrassing 
me or being rude to my family."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Timerra] 
The rules of royal life are complicated and...and 
arbitrary, sometimes, if we're being honest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Timerra] 
But you took time to study the proper speech 
and conduct of a retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Panette] 
It was the least I could do to repay your 
generosity."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Timerra] 
Panette, I want you to know something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Timerra] 
I will become a queen worthy of your efforts."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Timerra] 
A queen you can feel proud to serve."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Panette] 
I have no doubt. And for my part, I shall 
continue to serve you with the utmost zeal."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Panette] 
Boss, when you said I had changed...you were 
right. I have."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Panette] 
But for that, I have you to blame."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Timerra] 
Me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Panette] 
Yes. When we met, I was wild as they come."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Panette] 
My home life was...rocky, to say the least, and 
that left me filled with anger."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Panette] 
So each day, I would go into town and pick 
fights with anyone who got on my nerves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Panette] 
Looking back on that time now, I see how 
pointless it was."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Panette] 
Yet that was the only way I knew to cope...until 
I met you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Panette] 
Though at first, of course, I assumed you were 
as wild as I was."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Timerra] 
Hehe, we hit it off right away, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Timerra] 
Taking out goons by day, riding our wolves 
by night..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Panette] 
Yes. We were thick as thieves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Panette] 
Little by little, you helped point my rage in a 
more...useful direction."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Timerra] 
At men who cut you in line."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Panette] 
That only happened once. I was talking about 
all the bandits and thieves we fought."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Panette] 
You taught me to take all my pent-up, 
directionless anger and use it for good."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Timerra] 
Well, I'm glad. Though to be honest, that wasn't 
really intentional."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Panette] 
Yes, I figured as much."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Panette] 
Even so, if I had never met you..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Panette] 
that rage might have swallowed me whole and 
spit out a lonely, resentful husk."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Panette] 
I could have wasted my life feeling bitter about 
the hand I was dealt."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Timerra] 
Ah, that was just what I needed. It's been way 
too long since we rode together."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Panette] 
Yes, Boss. Nothing beats a nice jaunt 
on wolfback."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Timerra] 
You and I used to go riding practically every 
night. What happened to those days?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Panette] 
War happened. The world has changed, 
unfortunately."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Timerra] 
Isn't that the truth. And you know, you've 
mellowed out a lot since those days."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Panette] 
What do you mean by that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Timerra] 
Oh, come on! Remember how we met?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Timerra] 
You had a bunch of bandits tied to trees and 
were about to feed them to the wolves."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Panette] 
That was merely to intimidate them! I wasn't 
actually going to─"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Timerra] 
And don't get me started on the way you used 
to talk. You'd say things like..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Timerra] 
""Feeling hungry, punks? I got a fresh serving of 
knuckles for you right here!"""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Panette] 
Why, I beg you to cease this coarse impression."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Timerra] 
Hehe!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Timerra] 
Don't worry, Panette. I loved the old you, but 
I love the new you too."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Panette] 
The feeling is mutual, Boss. Your relentless 
teasing aside."
