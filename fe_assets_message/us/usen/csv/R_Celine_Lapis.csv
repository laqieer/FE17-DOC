[Céline] 
Let's see... This herb should be dried and then 
restored with water when it's time to ingest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Céline] 
This moss can be dried and powdered, and it is 
consumed to treat stomachache. I think that's it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Céline] 
And of course, these leaves make a very 
interesting tea when brewed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lapis] 2 
[Lapis] 
Princess Céline? Are you writing something?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Céline] 
Ah, hello, Lapis. I was just recording the wisdom 
you shared with me thus far in this journal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Céline] 
I thought you might read it over and let me 
know if I missed any details."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lapis] 
I'd be glad to. But I have to ask...why are you 
doing this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Céline] 
Preparing for the worst, I suppose."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lapis] 
What do you mean? There's no shortage of 
food or medicine in the stockpile."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Céline] 
Oh, not for us. For my people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lapis] 
Why would they need to know all this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Céline] 
Firene is a fertile nation, but I cannot rely on 
that being true forever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Céline] 
Any number of events could despoil the land."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Céline] 
If that happens, I think the knowledge you've 
imparted could prove useful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Lapis] 
I... I didn't realize you had such grand plans for 
the information I was sharing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Céline] 
I don't intend to wring you dry by any means. 
I shall interview others as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Céline] 
You have your own duties that demand your 
time, so I'll try not to impose too much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lapis] 
No, it's all right. I'm glad to help however I can. 
Please, impose to your heart's content."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Lapis] 
If the skills I used to survive in a barren land 
can come to good use..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Lapis] 
Well, I'm happy to share them!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Céline] 
Thank you, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Céline] 
But, uh... I thought that you learned all this 
from friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Lapis] 
AHH!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lapis] 
I... I'm sorry. I've been lying to you. These are 
all things I learned firsthand."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Céline] 
Truly? Don't apologize, then. Firsthand 
experience is much more valuable to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Céline] 
Thank you for your honesty. Your cooperation 
in this matter means a great deal to me, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Lapis] 
Thank you, Princess Céline. I'm happy to be of 
service to you and your people!"

[Lapis] 
Let's see... The shrub over here is edible."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Lapis] 
Its leaves are delicious when boiled. You can 
eat them or dry them and make them into tea."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Céline] 
Very interesting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lapis] 
See these berries? Now, you can't eat them. 
But if you crush them, they make a nice salve."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Céline] 
I've seen these grow everywhere and somehow 
never knew they had such uses."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Lapis] 
This moss here is great for treating burns."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Lapis] 
Dry it, crush it into a fine powder, and mix it 
with water to make a soothing ointment."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Céline] 
Will wonders never cease!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lapis] 
If you're really that interested, there's much 
more I can teach you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Lapis] 
I'm from a regular, well-to-do village, but I have 
friends from impoverished lands."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Lapis] 
Everything I know about scavenging, I picked up 
from them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Céline] 
I ought to thank those friends of yours. They─ 
and you─have taught me so much."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Lapis] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Lapis] 
I have to say, I'm surprised to see a princess so 
interested in this sort of thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lapis] 
Surely there's no need for you to find tea in 
the wild. You can just go to a shop."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lapis] 
Medicine too. You can just buy whatever salves 
and ointments you need, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Céline] 
Under normal circumstances, yes. In times of 
peace, what you say is very true."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Céline] 
But in this time of hardships, nothing is certain. 
Your knowledge may prove useful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Céline] 
I suspect you have much more to teach, Lapis, 
and I am eager to absorb it all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Lapis] 
If that's what you want, Princess Céline..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Lapis] 
I'd be happy to share what I've learned over 
the years."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Lapis] 
Uh! From my friends' experiences, that is!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Céline] 
Haha, I shall hold you to that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Céline] 1

[Céline] 
Oh my. What is that you're drinking, Lapis? 
It smells heavenly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
Princess Céline?! Uh... This is regular tea. Yep. 
Nothing special about it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Céline] 
Do you mind if I have a sip?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Lapis] 
What?! No! You're a princess. You shouldn't be 
drinking this sort of thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Céline] 
What's the harm in it? You seem to be suffering 
no ill effects."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lapis] 
It's not that. It's... Well..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lapis] 
See, I didn't get the tea leaves from a shop. 
I harvested them from a wild plant nearby."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Céline] 
Do you mean that you make your own tea? 
That's wonderful."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Céline] 
Now I must insist that you let me try it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Lapis] 
Uh... All right, if you insist. Here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Céline] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Céline] 
Oh! This is bracing indeed! I wasn't quite 
expecting the taste."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Lapis] 
You like it? I actually made the tea set by hand 
as well."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Céline] 
You made this? Its finery would shame some 
artisans I know."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Céline] 
I'm very impressed that you're able to make so 
many things all on your own."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lapis] 
I appreciate that, but really, it's nothing special."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Céline] 
Nonsense, Lapis. If it's not too much trouble, 
could you teach me to brew tea like this?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Céline] 
I'd be interested in learning which wild plants 
to pick and how to brew tea from them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Lapis] 
I'd be happy to. Let's go to the forest together 
sometime and I'll teach you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Céline] 
Excellent. I shall pay close attention, my teacher 
of tea."
