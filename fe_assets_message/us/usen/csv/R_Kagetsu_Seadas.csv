[Kagetsu] 
That was terribly close!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Seadall] 
Kagetsu! What happened?! Was it...misfortune? 
Was the card right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
I did not realize...there were bear dens near my 
training ground!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Seadall] 
But...there's not a mark on you. You seem 
perfectly fine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Seadall] 
What a relief! I suppose my divination 
was wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
No... No, it was right!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Seadall] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
I was prepared for misfortune. As soon as one 
bear came toward me, I quickly fled."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
Without your prediction, I would have trained as 
normal and failed to notice until too late."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Seadall] 
So...my fortune telling saved you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
Indeed, Seadall, it saved my life. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Seadall] 
No. Thank you, Kagetsu. This has given me 
more confidence in my divination skills."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
Good. Phew! This rubbing elbows with death 
has made me hungry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
Just now I caught some glimpse of you and I 
sitting down to eat."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Seadall] 
I'm sure your premonition is right. In fact, I bet 
your vision showed us eating sandwiches."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
Meat between two breads─how did you know?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Seadall] 
Well, as it happens, I had just decided to treat 
you to a meal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Kagetsu] 
Ah! This gives me another vision─one in which 
our friendship blooms."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Seadall] 
Ha! No need for divination there. We're already 
friends."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Seadall] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Seadall! I have glimpsed your future again. Your 
performance this evening will be well attended!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
No need for your skills on that front. My 
performances are always packed full."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
I can also see that it will rain tonight. Be sure 
to prepare for your walk home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Seadall] 
That does seem fairly obvious, Kagetsu. Rain 
clouds just rolled in."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
You see? Useful as cooling fans in winter."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Seadall] 
Your premonitions really do seem to be for the 
most useless things."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Seadall] 
If this power of yours was only a bit more... 
applicable...I'm sure I'd be quite envious."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
No need to envy abilities like mine when you 
can read fortunes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Seadall] 
My fortune-telling skills are well-regarded, 
sure... But sadly, they aren't perfect."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
Why do you say so?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Seadall] 
My master...the one who taught me to dance... 
he was attacked and killed by thieves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Seadall] 
If my divination skills had been perfect, I would 
have seen it coming. I could have saved him."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Seadall] 
So, I keep honing my skills in hopes I don't ever 
have to experience that kind of regret again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps you would read my fortune, then."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Seadall] 
Your fortune?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes! You said that you wish to sharpen 
your skills."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
I would gladly serve as your training partner."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Seadall] 
That would be very helpful. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
Think nothing of it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Seadall] 
Well then, let's see what fate has in store 
for you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Seadall] 
Kagetsu, as the fog of destiny parts to reveal 
what lies ahead, I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Seadall] 
Oh no!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Seadall] 
It's La Mort...the Death card. And it's in the 
upright position."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Seadall] 
It means misfortune awaits you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Kagetsu] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Hmm... La Roue de Fortune─the Wheel of 
Fortune in the upright position..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Kagetsu] 
Hello, Seadall. What are you doing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Seadall] 
I'm honing my divination powers using a 
Tarot deck."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Seadall] 
While I'm best known for my dancing, I'm also 
skilled at fortune telling."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Already you excel, and yet you remain in 
continual practice. You are very dedicated."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Seadall] 
I have my reasons..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"セアダスAs long as I'm practicing, I could give your 
fortune a read, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
Oh, no need. I already have this ability."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
I will demonstrate! Ahem...prepare yourself!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
Soon you will be eating...sliced meats layered 
between two breads!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Seadall] 
Yes, that's right. But how did you..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
I told you. It is my ability to see the future."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Seadall] 
You can just...see the future?! Could you show 
me how?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
I am surprised you are so interested! Alas, 
my power cannot be taught."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
I was born with this gift. I did not acquire it 
by learning."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
But it is cooling fans in winter, as they say. 
Useless. I get only inconsequential details."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Seadall] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Seadall] 
Eh, it sounds like I should probably focus on my 
own divination skills."
