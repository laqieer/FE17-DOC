[Veyle] 
Hehe, I had so much fun today!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
So this is what it feels like to have family."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
Veyle, there's...something I'd like to ask you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
How do you feel about our father? About 
Sombron?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Veyle] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
Soon we'll have to face him. Not as his children, 
but as his enemies. So...I had to ask."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Veyle] 
Yes..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
Papa hurt so many people in the past. And now 
he's doing it again. He is...evil."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Veyle] 
He's never shown me kindness. I'm not sure he 
thinks of me at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Veyle] 
Still..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Veyle] 
He is family, just like you. So I can't hate 
him entirely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011_F,"[Veyle] 
He is family, just like you. So I can't hate 
him entirely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Veyle] 
Sometimes I just wish I could be part of a happy 
family. But I know that's a silly dream."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Veyle] 
At the very least, I hope I can stop Papa before 
he hurts anyone else."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Veyle] 
No, I will stop him."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Veyle] 
So, that is how I feel about our father."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
Thank you for telling me, Veyle. I feel the same."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
The time for reconciliation is long past. I will 
use all of my power to stop Sombron."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
But I won't be able to do it without you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Veyle] 
Don't worry. You and me and the rest of our 
friends...we'll stop him together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020_F,"[Veyle] 
Don't worry. You and me and the rest of our 
friends...we'll stop him together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
OK. Let's do this, Veyle. Then, when it's all 
over, our future can truly begin."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Veyle] 
Yes. For our future."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Do you remember when you gave me 
the dragonstone?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
I wish I could say I did... But everything from 
before I woke up is hazy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Veyle] 
Well, you and I met just one time, a thousand 
years ago."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003_F,"[Veyle] 
Well, you and I met just one time, a thousand 
years ago."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
We only met once?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Veyle] 
Mm-hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Veyle] 
All of our siblings had died in the war."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Veyle] 
You were the only one to survive, and you 
came to see me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007_F,"[Veyle] 
You were the only one to survive, and you 
came to see me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Veyle] 
I was very young then─frail and frightened─ 
and you handed me the dragonstone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Veyle] 
You told me that you couldn't stay by my side 
but that you were still with me no matter what."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
Oh, so I said that to you...all that time ago..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Veyle] 
You did. The dragonstone is shattered, but it 
was my protective talisman for a very long time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Veyle] 
I held it close when Mama died and when Papa 
returned and said horrible things to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Veyle] 
I knew that as long as I had the dragonstone, 
I could be strong...and hold on until I saw you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
Veyle, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Veyle] 
Even if you can't remember what you did, 
I am still so grateful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Veyle] 
If you hadn't given me the dragonstone, we 
never would have found each other again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I'm grateful too. To think you held me in your 
heart all those years..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
Without you, Veyle, I wouldn't be standing here 
right now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Veyle] 
Now that we're reunited, we'll be together 
forever, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alear] 
That's right. Nothing can separate us ever again."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Veyle...why are you looking at me like that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Veyle] 
I just... Are you really OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
I really am. I mean, it was strange...taking 
Corrupted form and waking up from that..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
But I'm fine now. And it's all thanks to 
you, Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Veyle] 
I'm relieved."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Veyle] 
I... I also wanted to apologize for everything 
I've done. Everything I did in the past."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Veyle] 
So many people died. And it's because of me. 
I was too weak. It's my fault they're dead."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Veyle] 
I know I can't be forgiven, not completely. But if 
you could, even just a little... I'm so sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
Oh, Veyle. It wasn't your fault. The Fell Dragon 
was controlling you. He's to blame─not you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
You say you're weak, but it was your strength 
that freed you from him. That's impressive."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Veyle] 
I'll get stronger too. Like I said before, I want to 
be a dragon like you─ready to save the world."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Veyle] 
And I'll do everything in my power to make 
that happen. I just hope...you'll help me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alear] 
Absolutely. That's what a big brother is for."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015_F,"[Alear] 
Absolutely. That's what a big sister is for."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
I'll do anything I can to help you. It's the least 
I can do to make up for not being around."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Don't worry. I'm right beside you, little sister. 
We can do this together."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Veyle] 
Yes, we can."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
There you are! I have something I want to 
give you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001_F,"[Alear] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
There you are! I have something I want to 
give you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Oh?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Veyle] 
It's for you! I hope you love it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
What a beautiful stone! It's so clear and blue. 
You went looking for it, just for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Veyle] 
I did. I wanted to give you something in return 
for the dragonstone you gave me so long ago."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Veyle] 
I've poured all of my energy into it so, if we 
get separated again, we can find each other."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
We really are siblings, it seems."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Veyle] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
Veyle, I also have something I'd like to give you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Veyle] 
This is...the Pact Ring!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
Yes. It's for you, Veyle. You're my dear sister 
and the person most precious to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Veyle] 
But..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
I can't imagine giving this ring to anyone else."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Veyle] 
I can't accept this. This is very special to you, 
Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Veyle] 
I'm the one who took Lumera's life! I don't 
deserve it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
That's not true. You do deserve it, and I want 
you to have it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
Besides, I know Mother would want this. She 
would want both of us to be happy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
No matter what."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Veyle] 
I understand. I will take it, then."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Veyle] 
You gave me the dragonstone and I made it my 
talisman. This ring─it will be my new one."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
That makes me happy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
I know how much the dragonstone meant to 
you. I hoped this could replace it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
No, not so much replace it...more like symbolize 
something new─our bond as siblings."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
Of course, I had no idea you'd go and give me a 
pretty stone before I could give you this ring!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Veyle] 
I'm glad I did. I like that we think so similarly."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
You gave me the stone so that we'd always be 
able to find each other..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
But I'm not going anywhere, Veyle. You and 
I are family, and we're sticking together."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Veyle] 
The ring and the stone...they can remind us 
that we never have to be apart again."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Veyle] 
OK, let's win this war and bring peace to the 
world...for Lumera. She would like that."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Alear] 
Yes, she would. And we can do it together."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Veyle] 
I swear on this ring... I'll stand by your side and 
be a dragon who's ready to save the world."
