[Yunaka] 
Fogado! Hi! Hey!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Fogado] 
Hey, Yunaka! You've got a real spring in your 
step today."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
I do! And it's all thanks to your advice. I've been 
going out of my way to show folks some trust."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
It's amazing how quickly they've warmed up. 
I've been having so much fun! Great trick!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Fogado] 
Huh, so that's what's going on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Fogado] 
You make it sound like people are acting 
different, but actually, they're the same as ever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Yunaka] 
What? No way. Wait, really?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Fogado] 
Yeah. Most folks are basically good. You just 
didn't give them a chance before."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Yunaka] 
So you're saying it was...me who changed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Fogado] 
Yup. Honestly, it's a remarkable turnaround."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Do you know what this means, Fogado?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Yunaka] 
I've unlocked the secret to having a nice time! 
Every day's gonna be an adventure now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Fogado] 
Well then, how about it? Does the new and 
improved Yunaka want to go to a party?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Yunaka] 
Ah, well...about that. I'm still pretty 
uncomfortable with crowds."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Yunaka] 
I can choose to trust people, but it's a lot 
harder to control an instinctive reaction."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Yunaka] 
I still feel like a party could be fun, though!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Yunaka] 
So, how about this. We'll say getting me to go 
to parties is...something to work on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Yunaka] 
I want to get past my fear of people. I want to 
enjoy life the way you do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Fogado] 
At this rate, I'm sure you'll be out-partying me 
in no time at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Fogado] 
But we'll take it step by step. How about today, 
you and I go out for a meal?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Fogado] 
We'll start small. A nice, quiet place with not 
too many people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Yunaka] 
Oh, that's perfect! I like the way you think!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Yunaka] 
Someday we'll be at some fancy ball or other 
and we'll look back on this and laugh! Ohoho!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Fogado] 
Whoa, whoa! Who let the party animal out of 
her cage?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Yunaka] 
Zappy! You know it's all your fault!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 

[Fogado] 
Hey, I'm sorry for dragging you to that party. 
I didn't realize it wasn't your kind of thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
No, that's on me. I'm sorry for running off like 
that in the middle of all the fun."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Yunaka] 
The truth is, I... I'm not comfortable in crowds."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Yunaka] 
Surrounded on all sides like that, you never 
know who might be out for blood."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Fogado] 
Wait. Did I hear that right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Yunaka] 
Um...probably not? Forget it. Not important."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Yunaka] 
I'm just anxious around people, is the thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Fogado] 
Seems like there's some baggage there... 
Anyway..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Fogado] 
I promise not to drag you along like that again. 
I'm sorry you had a bad time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Yunaka] 
No, no. Don't worry about it. Thanks, though."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Fogado] 
Heh."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Fogado] 
Tell me something. What do you think of me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Yunaka] 
Of you? Well, let's see..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Yunaka] 
I think you're someone who wants to make 
every day as fun as it can be."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Yunaka] 
I envy that about you, to be honest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Fogado] 
If you want some of these good vibes... 
try showing people a little trust."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Yunaka] 
Trust?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Fogado] 
Some folks are real pieces of work, no doubt."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Fogado] 
But if you always keep your walls up, you might 
miss out on making new friends."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Yunaka] 
Are you saying that's the trick to enjoying life 
the way you do?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Fogado] 
That's exactly what I'm saying."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Yunaka] 
Thanks for the pep talk, Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Yunaka] 
I'm going to take it to heart. I'm going to try 
to start trusting people more."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1

[Fogado] 
Hey, Yunaka! I'm headed to a party right now. 
You wanna come along?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Party? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Fogado] 
Ah, not feeling it, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Fogado] 
You're always in such high spirits, I thought 
you'd be game."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Fogado] 
But hey, no worries. I'll see you when I have 
some other business. Take care."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Fogado] 
[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Yunaka] 
He came at me so fast I forgot to put 
my act on!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Yunaka] 
I better fix this fast. He'll expose the real me 
if I don't."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Yunaka] 
Heeey! Fogaaado!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Fogado] 1 

[Fogado] 
What's up?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Zappy! I was totally yanking your bowstring. 
I love raucous carousing in enclosed spaces!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Fogado] 
You sure you're not forcing yourself?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Yunaka] 
Don't be ridiculous! Parties are fun! I love fun!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Yunaka] 
Take me to the parties. Every single one. 
All of them!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Fogado] 
Ahh, so I had you pegged right. Good. Knew 
we'd get along."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Fogado] 
In that case, come on! Let's head to the party!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Fogado] 
Play hard or don't play at all, am I right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Yunaka] 
Dang right! Hehe...heh..."
