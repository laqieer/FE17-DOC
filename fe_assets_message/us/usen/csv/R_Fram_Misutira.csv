[Framme] 
I just don't get it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Framme] 
Why did she leave all of a sudden?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Timerra] 2 

[Timerra] 
Hup! Ahh... 
Hup! Ahh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Framme] 
Princess Timerra?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Timerra] 
Huff... Huff... I need to get stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Framme] 
Looks like you're training."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Timerra] 
Yep! Gotta be strong to protect my country!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Timerra] 
Oh. Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Timerra] 
I'm really sorry I split the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Framme] 
No, no, it's fine! I know you must be pretty busy 
with all your important princess duties."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Timerra] 
I got so wrapped up picking clothes for you 
I completely forgot it was time to train."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Framme] 
Was that all?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Framme] 
I thought, maybe... I dunno. That you didn't like 
the outfit I gave you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Timerra] 
No, no! It was stylish as all get-out!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Framme] 
But then...why'd you act like there was 
something wrong with it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Timerra] 
Uh, OK. Don't take this the wrong way..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Timerra] 
The Queendom of Solm? It's a hot place. 
I wouldn't last 15 minutes in that heavy fabric."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Timerra] 
Plus, I need nice, movable clothes so I can be 
ready to fight at a moment's notice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Framme] 
Ooh! So that's what it was about."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Timerra] 
That dress was really cute though─honest! 
I'm sorry for being so, you know, wishy-washy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Framme] 
No, it's OK! I just feel silly for not thinking of 
that on my own."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Framme] 
Can I maybe...pick another outfit for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Framme] 
Except this time, something better suited for 
that toasty Solm weather."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Timerra] 
Aw, what a great idea! Of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Timerra] 
Another shopping trip with my friend Framme─ 
I can't wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Timerra] 
First I gotta prepare for this next battle though. 
Can't try on clothes if I'm dead."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Framme] 
Of course. I'll leave you to it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Timerra] 
Actually, I was gonna ask if you wanted to join. 
What do you say?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Framme] 
Training my heart out with Princess Timerra? 
I'd love nothing more!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Timerra] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Timerra] 
♪Stylish clothes for you and me! 
It's like furniture for your body!♪"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Framme] 
That's a fun song, Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Timerra] 
That's 'cause I'm having fun! It's exciting to 
pick out someone else's clothes for a change."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Timerra] 
Got yours ready to go?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Framme] 
Yup! I'm all set."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Timerra] 
Me too! OK, without any further ado... 
Show me what you picked out!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Framme] 
Brace yourself. I selected, just for you... 
this cute frilly dress!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Timerra] 
Aaah! I love it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Framme] 
I knew you would. Come on and feel this fabric. 
It's nice and thick."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Timerra] 
Oh, uh. It is?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Framme] 
Yup. All your clothes are so light, I figured you 
might like something a little warmer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Timerra] 
How, uh...thoughtful of you..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Framme] 
What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Timerra] 
Huh? Oh, sorry. I love it, Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Timerra] 
Now, ready to see what I chose for you? 
Ta-da! It's a scarlet robe!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Framme] 
It's so cute!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Timerra] 
Yeah? I added some flashy accessories to make 
that distinctive dye in the robe really pop."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Framme] 
I love it. This is exactly my color. It looks nice 
and breathable too."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Timerra] 
Hehe, right? I thought something nice and 
lightweight would suit you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Timerra] 
Wait. Oh, shoot!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Framme] 
What's wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Timerra] 
I just remembered a thing I gotta get to. 
Princess business. You know how it is."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Timerra] 
Sorry, Framme. I'll make it up to you─I promise!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Timerra] 
[Framme] 
Huh... That was sudden."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Framme] 
Something seemed kinda off, there."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Framme] 
Maybe she didn't like the dress I picked out..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Timerra] 2 
[Framme] 1"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Framme] 
This top is so cute, I can't even handle it. 
Ooh, and that red skirt is really chic!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Framme] 
Oh no. This place has accessories too? Well, 
goodbye, money. It was nice knowing you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Timerra] 
Tell me about it. I have to stop myself from 
snapping up everything in the store."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Framme] 
Princess Timerra! What are you doing here?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Timerra] 
Shopping. Why? Is that weird?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Framme] 
Oh, uh, no! I just would have assumed you had 
people to do that for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Timerra] 
I like to go shopping on my own. Incognito. 
That way I can try on clothes, see what fits."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Framme] 
Wow, I love that! It's almost like you're a 
real person."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Timerra] 
Hehe! Hehe, thanks! I think!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Timerra] 
Gotta say, Framme. You've got style."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Timerra] 
Your color scheme is elegant, yet eye-catching. 
The ribbons add a touch of flair."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Timerra] 
And don't get me started on that skirt. 
It's completely, unequivocally you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Framme] 
You really think so? I'm honored."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Framme] 
I spent a long time on this look. Took me a 
while to nail down the right ensemble."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Timerra] 
Trust me, I know the feeling. It's hard to find a 
perfect balance between form and function."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Framme] 
Exactly! I want something that's both practical 
and cute as heck. Is that so much to ask?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Timerra] 
Hehe, you're speaking my language."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Framme] 
I can't believe I'm talking fashion with Princess 
Timerra! It's like a dream come true."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Timerra] 
Hey, I've got an idea. Why don't you pick out 
clothes for me some time?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Framme] 
Really? Really?! REALLY?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Timerra] 
Really. And I'll pick something out for you too. 
We'll get all dressed up!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Framme] 
That sounds so fun!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Timerra] 
It's settled, then!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025,"[Framme] 
I can't wait to put together the perfect outfit 
for you."
