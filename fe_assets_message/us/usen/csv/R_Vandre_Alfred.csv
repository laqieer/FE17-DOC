[Vander] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
What's up, Vander? Your invite caught me 
a little off guard."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Vander] 
Have a look at this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alfred] 
Are these windflowers? A whole garden full... 
but why here?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Vander] 
I thought it would be a waste for them to grow 
only within the castle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Vander] 
I planted what I could find of them here, so that 
everyone may enjoy them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Vander] 
I must admit...I didn't expect them to thrive 
quite so much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alfred] 
Heh heh, they're some real good-looking 
windflowers, I'll give you that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alfred] 
When I gaze at them, I have the strangest feeling 
that Queen Lumera is here at my side."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Vander] 
I know just what you mean."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Vander] 
I wanted you to see the windflowers too, 
Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alfred] 
Thanks. It means a lot, you know."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alfred] 
Once we get our peace back, why don't you 
and me plant even more windflowers here?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Vander] 
Yes. We shall plant them together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alfred] 
And this time, we'll make sure the garden 
stays safe."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alfred] 
That way, Queen Lumera can watch over her 
people from here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Vander] 
It is as she would wish, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Vander] 1

[Alfred] 
When I was little, Queen Lumera gave me 
flowers for my birthday."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
They were these real pretty white flowers. 
Couldn't tell you what they were called."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Vander] 
Windflowers, most likely. Queen Lumera was 
especially passionate about growing them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alfred] 
Windflowers. I'll have to remember that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Vander] 
Queen Lumera once made a gift of windflowers 
for me as well."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alfred] 
Oh, was it your birthday too?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Vander] 
No. There was nothing special about 
the occasion."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alfred] 
Oh. Hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alfred] 
Maybe it was her way of saying, ""Good work, 
my loyal retainer!"""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Vander] 
Perhaps. Such gestures were typical of 
our queen."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Vander] 
The garden where she tended her windflowers 
was trampled into mud during the battle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Vander] 
Thinking about it now, I wish I had spent more 
time with the queen."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alfred] 
Well, we all have regrets. Nothing to do with 
them but keep moving forward."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alfred] 
It's up to us now to keep our people safe, just 
like Queen Lumera used to."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Vander] 1

[Alfred] 
Vander, I owe you an apology."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Vander] 
An apology? What for?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alfred] 
I messed up big time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alfred] 
If I'd been quicker about getting to Lythos, 
I could've saved Queen Lumera."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alfred] 
I know the queen meant a lot to you. I'm really 
sorry she's gone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Vander] 
You are mistaken, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Vander] 
If there is blame to cast, I bear as much as you. 
More, in fact, as I was her retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Vander] 
So you see, you have nothing to apologize for."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
But I..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Vander] 
Without your presence, Prince Alfred, our losses 
may have been even greater."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Vander] 
As I see it, I have ample reason to thank you 
and none to resent you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alfred] 
Well, if you say so. Happy to help."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alfred] 
Hey, uh, is it OK with you if I visit again?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Vander] 
Of course. Let us share stories of happier times 
with Queen Lumera."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alfred] 
Happier times, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Vander] 
Indeed. I think Queen Lumera would prefer that 
to brooding over our failures, don't you?"
