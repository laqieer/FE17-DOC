[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I'm an early riser too, so I think you were right 
when you said we're a lot alike."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
Hahaha, you really think so? I knew it!"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
What do you say we work out together? I bet 
you could get pretty buff with my routine!"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
I don't think I can put on any more muscle, but 
it sounds fun, so...why not?"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Alfred] 
Morning, Lyn! Smell that fresh, dewy air!"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
Wait, it's not even dawn. You have to let the 
night finish before you can say ""good morning."""
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Alfred] 
I didn't expect there to be an Emblem like you 
in Elusia. I think we'll get along famously."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
True, I may seem like a different type of noble, 
but I agree that we will find a common ground."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Anna] 
Have you given any thought to working in my 
shop? I'd make it worth your while!"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
What would I do? Sales? Security? If we were 
being robbed, I could only yell at the thief."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Anna] 
Au contraire! One mean look from you is worth 
a dozen hired brutes."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Do you think so? Still, the answer is no. It's you 
who makes this shop work, and no one else."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I appreciate that you keep up the sales pitch, 
even to an Emblem. Alas, I have no money."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Anna] 
Hey, no problem. If you don't have hard 
currency, I'd accept working the price off."
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Anna] 
Step right up! All sorts of rare goods in one 
place for your buying pleasure! What'll it be?"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Hmm. I know your face, don't I? No, there's 
no way. I must be imagining things."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Is something wrong, Bunet? I've noticed you 
staring off into space quite a bit as of late."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
I've been thinking... What if everything in the 
world is just an ingredient in one giant dish?"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
Well, I have no form, so I can't be an ingredient. 
The same goes for the sky, wind, and clouds."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Bunet] 
I suppose the sun and stars are not ingredients 
either, then. Yes, I see now. Thank you, Lyn."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Bunet] 
As a chef, I'm keenly aware of flavors as well as 
colors. And you, Lyn, could use more red."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
Do you think so? I should think garnishes come 
in many different colors."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Bunet] 
You have an air of earthiness about you, Lyn. 
If you were a food, you would be...a garnish."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
A garnish? Me? Bunet, I haven't the slightest 
idea what you're talking about."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Boucheron] 
I'm still sniffling over that story you told 
me, Lyn!"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
I've decided that I'm going to do great things 
too, just like you."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
Thanks for listening. And I'd say it's good to 
have a goal."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Truth is stranger than fiction, after all. I bet your 
journey will be more thrilling than any story."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Boucheron] 
I love reading stories. If there are any you could 
share with me, I'm all ears."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
I do have one story I could tell you, it's about all 
the amazing things I experienced on my journey."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Boucheron] 
I'm really enjoying our journey. Wherever we go, 
my friends keep me from getting lost."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
It's nice, isn't it─not having to put on a brave 
face. You can simply enjoy yourself."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Céline] 
Thank you for taking tea with me. I always find 
great joy in our chats."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
So do I. We'll do this again soon, I hope."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Céline] 
Of course. Hearing tales of your world makes 
me reconsider my own approach to life."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Meanwhile, I'm learning a lot about tea. There's 
so much beyond the plains I never knew."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Céline] 
I cannot help but envy you, Lyn. Your life seems 
so free, so unrestrained."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
Freedom goes hand in hand with danger. But I 
know some freedoms are worth the risk."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Céline] 
I've steeled myself to fight for peace, but I fear 
sometimes that this war will never end."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Everything ends, one way or another. I know 
you're nervous, but don't lose faith."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Chloé] 
Hey, Lyn! Look what I got─it's gecko rolled in 
pepper and fried in frog oil."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
Oh, is that...for me? Oh no. What a shame. 
Emblems can't eat food."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
Oh...I'm so sorry. I forgot. Here, I'll describe 
every last detail of the taste to you as I eat."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Every detail? No, thank you. Maybe some other 
time, when you eat something more common."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
You're always eating the juiciest-looking things. 
My mouth would water if it could."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
They're all so good! I wish I could sample some 
things from your world too."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Chloé] 
I wonder what kind of food we'll find in the next 
town. Do you have any favorite foods, Lyn?"
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Good question. Meatballs, boar-meat dumplings, 
sausage... Most kinds of meat, I suppose."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Wonderful news, Lyn! I've found a way to not 
be upset by frightened reactions to my face!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
That's much different from your original goal. 
I like this one better. How did you do it?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
I imagine that the other person is merely acting 
scared of my face. As a joke. And jokes are fun!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
If it works, it works. I don't think you have to 
worry. You're kind, and everyone knows it."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Lyn... I tried to follow your advice about smiling. 
People were even more terrified of me!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
Oh, I see. That is a tricky situation. Perhaps you 
shouldn't take my advice on this one..."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Citrinne] 
How can I convince people my face isn't scary? 
I try to pay it no mind, but it happens so often..."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Try to guide them out of their initial discomfort. 
A confident, steady smile might do the trick!"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I was born on the plains, and I've always missed 
them since I left."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Clanne] 
You get that way too? Wow, I do feel better. 
I thought I might be pathetic."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
No, it just means we love where we came from. 
When you can, go and visit your parents."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
Maybe I will. Right now, though, I can't imagine 
being away from the Divine Dragon."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
You look a little down. Is there something you'd 
like to talk about?"
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
I miss my parents. Is that weird? Right now 
should be a happy time, not a sad one."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Clanne, you look sad. Are your chores getting 
to you?"
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Nope, I love doing chores for the Divine Dragon. 
In fact, I'm worried I might run out."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Diamant] 
I apologize for my behavior, Lyn. I strive for 
peace, yet I held on to bitterness toward you."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
Don't apologize, Diamant. I understand. If I had 
lost someone precious to me, I'd do the same."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
Starting today, I want us to be true comrades in 
arms─to fight side by side. Will you accept me?"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Of course! I would enjoy nothing more. We'll be 
able to grow much stronger as a team."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Diamant] 
There's a familiar warmth to your power, Lyn. 
Your determination reminds me of my father."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
I'm honored to hear that, Diamant. I take it as a 
sign that we're growing to trust each other."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Diamant] 
Emblem Lyn... King Hyacinth used your power 
to wound and capture my father. I... I can't..."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
I understand...and I'm sorry. I was under the Fell 
Dragon's power. I know that's of little comfort..."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Working out is important to you, but I worry 
that you might be overdoing it."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Etie] 
Trust me, what looks like too much to you is 
just right for me. I know my limits."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Etie] 
Every session, I push them just a little bit 
further so I can reach new heights."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
If you say so. I'm not going to stop worrying, 
but I trust your ability to overcome anything."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
You're exercising every time I lay eyes on you. 
What spurs you to work so hard?"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Etie] 
I could get toned, or I could lie around doing 
nothing. It's an easy choice."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Etie] 
You're so graceful, Lyn. And with a little more 
training, you'd have muscles on top of muscles."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
I'm trained in the sword and bow, but I never 
thought about muscle training. Interesting idea."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I'm told you pretend to be an ordinary citizen so 
you can gather intel. Very clever. I should try it."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Fogado] 
Please. There's no way someone as remarkable 
as you could pass for an average person."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
You think I can't blend in? That's funny. You 
would stand out in any crowd."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Fogado] 
Oh, I don't know about that. My cover's never 
been blown yet."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Fogado] 
I'm not the sort to worry about acting all prince- 
like. That's not my thing. Being me is my thing."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
Well, you have a lot of personality. I like it. It's 
far better than having too little personality."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Are you truly a prince? Really? I'm sorry, it's 
just I still find it hard to believe."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Fogado] 
Sheesh, when you ask like that, I start to doubt 
it myself. I mean, I am the prince of Solm, right?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Framme] 
Dragons live much longer than humans. So, one 
day, I'll have to leave the Divine Dragon's side."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
Framme, the more you love someone, the 
harder it is to imagine being apart from them."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
But if you spend your time fretting about it, 
you won't enjoy the time you have together."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Framme] 
You're right, Lady Lyn. I'm gonna enjoy every 
second I have with the Divine Dragon."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Serving the Divine Dragon is hard work. And 
yet, you never seem to grow weary of it."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Framme] 
I don't! Doing stuff for the Divine Dragon is 
super inspiring. I could keep it up forever."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Framme] 
You're such a huge help to the Divine Dragon. 
Almost as much as me. Almost."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Your dedication is admirable. I promise, I'll 
never come between you and the Divine One."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I've put on a poor performance lately. Graceful 
technique just doesn't seem to be enough..."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
That's what you get for cutting corners with 
your strength training."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
I know you're busy, and training takes up time, 
but try to find a routine that works for you."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Goldmary] 
You're right. Shortcuts are not my style anyway. 
Will you teach me a good routine?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
You've refined your technique, Goldmary. 
I can't wait to see it in the next battle."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
Thank you. With my form honed to such elegant 
perfection, I won't even need strength training."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I envy how cool and intimidating you are in 
battle, Lyn. I'm much too charming for all that."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
No shortage of confidence in you, is there? 
It's well earned, though. You work hard at it."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Give me some advice, Lyn. How do I get people 
absolutely wrapped around my finger?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
Can never get enough attention, can you? 
I think you're charming already, but let's see..."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
Back home, the popular folks were those who 
thought of nature and others before themselves."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
You make a compelling point. OK, tell me more."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Hortensia] 
I've been studying you, Emblem Lyn. I'll bet 
you've had your share of gentleman callers?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
I've had a few suitors. They disappeared fast 
when I challenged them to swordplay, though."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Wow, you're the Emblem from my father's ring? 
You're almost as cute as I am..."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
That's quite a compliment, considering how 
adorable you are."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Being an Emblem's not so bad, but at times, 
I wish I could wander the world more freely."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Ivy] 
It took leaving my country altogether for me to 
realize how much I had been missing."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
I have no easy solution for you. Perhaps we 
could take walks together, for a start."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Oh, that'd be great. Thank you, Ivy. I'm glad 
I can confide in you about things like this."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Ivy] 
I still find it odd to fight alongside a family 
heirloom─but I'm glad you're here, Lyn."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
Elusia's royal family has a special place in my 
heart. I'm happy to lend you my strength."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Ivy] 
Your ring is something of an heirloom in my 
family. I suppose that makes things awkward."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Not at all. I spent many years in your father's 
company. King Hyacinth treated me well."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Your novel had me in stitches, Jade! I'm amazed 
at how well you hide your humorous side."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Jade] 
I get that a lot. Like you said, I'm always serious 
about laughter. Some people think I never laugh."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
Well, I, for one, think I've gotten much better at 
reading your happier expressions."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Jade] 
You have? Hmm. You're a funny warrior, Lyn... 
but I guess it takes one to know one. Hm."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Jade] 
I think laughter is the highest form of human 
expression. It's mysterious and profound..."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
I can see that you take laughter quite seriously. 
Your passion for comedy is inspiring."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Such a stern expression, Jade... If I upset you in 
that last battle somehow, you must tell me."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Jade] 
No, you're fine, Lyn. I was just admiring your 
smile. It's...very refreshing."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
It's hard imitating someone else's speech. You 
can end up making yourself feel unwelcome."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Jean] 
I've tried to mimic the way everyone else talks 
too, but I couldn't keep it up."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
It's better that way. The things we can't change 
about ourselves are what make us special."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Jean] 
Hmm, I will be helping a lot of people on this 
journey. They'll all learn about my home!"
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I'd never heard an accent like yours before. 
I'm taken with its own particular rhythm."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Jean] 
Is that how we sound to outsiders? I'm glad 
you think we don't seem silly."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Jean] 
Everybody can tell right off that I'm from a 
Firenese island by my accent."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
That's nothing to be ashamed of. You should 
wear the marks of your homeland proudly."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
If you disbelieve my prophetic power, then try 
asking me your own question."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
If you insist. You usually predict small details, 
right? So, what's for breakfast tomorrow?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
Ah. You will soon see that we will be eating... 
onigiri! Yes, I love onigiri!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Sounds more like a plan than a prediction. Or 
maybe you're just seeing what you want to see."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
OK, this time I will predict something you can 
see yourself. Very soon, you will be frustrated!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
What a strange prediction. How am I supposed 
to... Oh, I get it. That was a joke, right?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Hey, Kagetsu. You can see the future, right? 
Can you give me a prediction?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Naturally! Let me see... Your homeland will have 
lovely weather tomorrow! Take my word for it!"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lapis] 
Hey, Lyn? Have you ever lost out on something 
even though you worked really hard for it?"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
I have. Plenty of large animals have slipped 
away from me while I was hunting."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
I'd prepare so much, plan for every movement... 
and then it would just vanish. So frustrating."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
Heh, I guess you have to seize the moment 
sometimes. I'll learn from your lesson, Lyn!"
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I think you may have misunderstood me before. 
There was more to eat than just the grass..."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Lapis] 
Oh, that does make more sense. I guess I was 
too eager to relate with someone else..."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I was born on the Sacae Plains. Nature blessed 
us with her bounty in every direction."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
Oh! You'd never starve growing up on the 
plains. So much plant life to eat. All that grass..."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Lindon] 
I'm as rusty as I feared. My magic just isn't 
what it once was."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
Don't be absurd. You still contribute on the 
front lines. The enemy's mages can't touch you."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
Not so. I'm too used to everyday magic, which 
I'm always careful not to use at full power."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Trust me, no one who sees your ""everyday 
magic"" would imagine you're limiting yourself."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Lindon] 
It's been so long since I unleashed magic on 
people rather than ingredients. I may be rusty."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
You integrated magic into your daily life, huh? 
Maybe one day I'll chop food with my blade."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Lindon] 
Magic isn't just for defeating your enemies. 
You can create things, cook, and so much more."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
That's interesting. I can't use magic myself, but 
hearing you talk about it makes me wish I could."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Louis] 
There is such warmth in being surrounded by 
amiable friends. I'd disappear into it if I could."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
I've never met anyone who enjoyed watching 
people get along as much as you do."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Louis] 
Enjoyment comes in all forms, including this 
one. Now, shall we find you some new friends?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Hey! That's my ring! How many people do you 
plan on introducing me to?!"
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
There was one friend I had called Florina. She 
was adorable. We spent so much time together."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Louis] 
Perfect! That's the precise sort of thing I had 
hoped for! Please, tell me everything."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Louis] 
Apropos of nothing, do you have any friends 
with whom you let down your guard?"
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
The many friends I've fought alongside, for a 
start. Or is that not what you meant?"
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
You look tired. If there's something dragging 
you down, you can tell me. I'm a good listener."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Alear] 
I still hesitate sometimes in battle because I'm 
so inexperienced."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Alear] 
Then I second-guess myself afterward, thinking 
of all the things I should have done instead."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Don't worry about making mistakes. You have 
friends─and me─to guide you through them."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
This is a good world. Though it makes me miss 
the green, rolling plains of my home."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Alear] 
They sound beautiful. It would be nice if I could 
see them for myself someday."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Don't go thinking I'm some wishy-washy noble. 
I'm stronger than I look."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Alear] 
I never thought you seemed weak to begin with. 
I'd be nowhere without you, Lyn!"
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
You...don't need to stand at attention when 
we talk. Stop being so stiff, and relax a little."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Relax... You mean like this?"
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
Your expression is still a little stiff... You know, 
""stiff"" just might be who you are. It's great."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
My humor was unintentional, yet hearing you 
laugh does make me happy."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Mauvier] 
You're so lively. Always talking with others. I 
keep quiet out of fear of being misunderstood."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
If you start sharing your thoughts with others, 
there'll be fewer misunderstandings."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Mauvier] 
You have an air of freedom about you. I admit 
I am jealous."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
You're jealous because you overthink what it 
means to have freedom. Loosen up a bit."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Merrin] 
We've been through so many battles together. 
We make a very cool duo, don't you think?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
I agree. Our rapport is envied by many, I'm sure. 
But what made you think of this?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
Because I think it's time we form an alliance. 
The two of us together, we'd be unstoppable."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
An alliance? Yes, I'm in! Just one important 
question: which one of us gets to be the leader?"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Merrin] 
Lady Lyn, the way you move when you fight─ 
it's very impressive. I envy you."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
And I envy you and the way you ride that wolf. 
How I wish I could ride one across the plains."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Merrin] 
Pardon my saying so, Lady Lyn... I can't help 
but feel a sense of rivalry with you."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Really? I hope that changes with time. I'm 
certain we'd make better friends than rivals."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Timerra] 
I hate to say it, but at first, I didn't trust you. 
I mean, King Hyacinth controlled you, ya know?"
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
But after we talked and fought side by side... 
What I'm trying to say is, I really like you, Lyn."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
Thank you, Timerra. I really like you too. You're 
a princess and yet you're so very genuine."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
We should go out and have fun! We can pretend 
I'm wearing that outfit you chose for me."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Timerra] 
You and me, we should go out and have some 
fun. I've even got the perfect outfit for you."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
I'm rather fond of what I'm wearing, but more 
importantly...Emblems can't change clothes."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Your dress─it's quite flamboyant for a princess. 
Does the entire royal family wear such attire?"
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Timerra] 
Freedom is kinda our thing, so we wear what 
we like. Some flashy colors would suit you too!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Pandreo] 
What if my dancing isn't awful? What if it's just 
different from every other dance out there?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
Hmm, a new form of dance... Well, in that case, 
wouldn't every human movement be a dance?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Yes, exactly! We're all nonstop dancing and 
praying, each in our own way. And it's all good!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
What a lovely idea, Pandreo. Next time I watch 
you dance, I'll see it for how beautiful it truly is."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I heard you singing, so I stopped by to listen... 
and saw you flailing about so strangely!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, that's just my prayer dance. My friends call 
it the Dance of Darkness because it's so awful."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Pandreo] 
There's a time for partying and a time for 
praying. In my church, we make time for both."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Partying? I've never heard of such a church. 
I bet you're calmer around the Divine Dragon."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Panette] 
Alas, no one is brave enough to hunt for ghosts 
with me. Seems it's just the two of us, Lyn."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
The two of us? I don't remember agreeing 
to go. I'm not sure I want to meet a ghost."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Panette] 
Odd. You have so much in common with them. 
If I don't return, know that I went down fighting."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
You're going? All by yourself? You know I can't 
let you do that. You win─I'll be your escort."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I know you're fond of ghosts, but is it wise to 
push your eerie pastime on everyone you meet?"
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Panette] 
Ghosts are delightful, I assure you. My true aim 
is to test my peer's courage."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Panette] 
How is it that everyone finds insects and ghosts 
so frightening? I find them quite adorable."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
I myself am not scared of them. But I must ask, 
how do you know ghosts are adorable?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Rosado] 
Why are people so obsessed with war? We just 
take from each other, over and over."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
It's rare for you to be so serious. Are you 
feeling all right?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
Rude! I'm a knight! But imagine what I'd be if 
beauty was the world's obsession instead?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
A benevolent ruler, I'd like to think. That would 
be an interesting world, to say the least."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Rosado] 
Ah, you have such smooth and healthy skin. 
What's your secret?"
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
Exercise, perhaps? I haven't given it 
much thought."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Rosado] 
I love the way your ponytail swishes around 
in combat, Lyn. Like it's dancing!"
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Thanks, but you should probably keep your 
eyes on more important things in battle."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Saphir] 
A battle's not so different from a hunt. That's 
probably why I've survived so many of both."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
Must have been tough living as a mercenary, 
wandering from one battlefield to the next."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
Much as someone like you must thrive in war, 
I hope you understand that peace is our goal."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
As a mercenary, I wouldn't have. But I'm a 
royal knight now, and I do understand."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Saphir] 
So you grew up as a nomad in the plains, huh? 
I'll bet you're a better hunter than I am."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
Probably. I'm a complete novice at fishing, 
though. You'd have to give me some tips."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Saphir] 
We should spar sometime. I feel like we'd be 
a good match."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Agreed. I've fought enough tough opponents 
to know you'd be an interesting one."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Seadall] 
Lyn, you said I shouldn't dance for people who 
simply want their fortunes told."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Seadall] 
But when people are looking for answers, I think 
dancing might bring them the joy they seek."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
Hm... Well, you could say their fortune suggests 
they seek out a dance performance."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Seadall, you truly care about your customers. 
And one day they will be happy, I know it."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Seadall] 
My patrons haven't been satisfied lately. I dance 
then tell their fortunes...but it's not enough."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
No, it's too much. Try telling fortunes for some 
and dancing for others. Let each talent shine."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Seadall] 
You move beautifully in battle. When I watch 
you, I see wind blowing across vast plains."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
You're very perceptive, Seadall. You must be 
quite gifted to see my homeland like that."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Before...you told me to think you as ""only an 
Emblem."" But...I don't think I can."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Lyn] 
It's still too difficult to fight alongside me? I see. 
We'll ask the Divine Dragon if someone else─"
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Alcryst] 
No! You're not ""only"" anything. The more we 
battle together, the more precious you become."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
Oh! Hm-hm, I'm so glad to hear that, Alcryst. 
We should talk more often!"
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Thank you for lending me your strength, Lyn. 
I've come to rely on your power...a lot."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
Thank you, Alcryst. I've come to rely on your 
power as well. You're quite skilled!"
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Alcryst] 
You're the Emblem King Hyacinth once used... 
but now you're an ally? This is hard to accept."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Until you can forgive me, Alcryst, think of me 
only as an Emblem, not as Lyn."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Aww, I wish we had alpacas here... I want to 
pet one so badly. What am I saying?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Amber] 
Hahaha! Too late, Lyn. I heard that! You've been 
overwhelmed by alpaca power!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
I hate to admit it, but it seems you're right...and 
I think I've come to appreciate your power too."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Amber] 
You have? Really?! But you're so much cooler 
than me. I'm sorta stunned...but happy too!"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Hmm. Strange. I used to think alpacas were odd, 
but now I wonder how I missed their charm..."
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Yeah! Alpacas are the best. They helped me 
survive a life in the countryside before this."
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Amber] 
If we had alpacas on our team, we would never 
lose! Think you could help me train a few, Lyn?"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
I've never thought of recruiting alpacas. I guess 
they could be quite powerful under the fluff..."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Vander] 
Such times are these. Queen Lumera, gone; the 
Divine Dragon, awake; and Lady Lyn beside me."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
Life does as it will. I am but a passenger on 
this journey."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
A thousand years ago, I never imagined I'd be 
awakened from the ring again."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Lyn] 
I think you're right. We're passengers, but we're 
also constantly blessed with new experiences."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
It seems like you'd get tired standing up so 
straight all the time. Relax! Smile!"
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Vander] 
So be it, I shall indulge you. Behold. A smile. 
How is that? Better than you expected?"
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Vander] 
It is wonderful to see you full of energy, yet I 
fear you may catch cold in such light clothes."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
No, Vander, I'm fine. I've always worn... Now 
that you mention it, can Emblems catch a cold?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Nothing can strengthen you more than finding 
someone to believe in─someone to trust."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
I think I have. But, Lyn... Do you believe in me?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
I do. I've survived many hard times because of 
people like you─people I could put my faith in."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
Thank you, Lyn. I'll do my very best to live up 
to the faith and trust you put in me."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Veyle] 
You're amazing, Lyn. You're so forthright and 
sure of yourself. I want to be like that."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
But you are, Veyle. You are living your truth 
despite everything stacked against you."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
You look as if you have a lot on your mind, 
Veyle. Please, let me know if I can be of help."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Veyle] 
I don't know if I'm worthy of your kindness, 
Lyn. But thank you for the offer."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
Words have been attributed to me that I didn't 
say. Do you know why that might be, Yunaka?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Yunaka] 
That was probably me. I may have done some 
impressions of you. It was only for a giggle!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
I knew it. That does it, young lady─no more 
impressions! Of anyone! Not even for giggles!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
No! Come on, I'm sorry! You can forgive me, 
can't you?! Friends forgive each other!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Your sword's got a wicked edge. Oh, it looks 
so deadly. I've gotta try it. Can I?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
I'd love to say yes, but since it lacks a physical 
form, you'll have to be satisfied with looking."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Yunaka] 
You're so fierce and gorgeous, Lyn. I don't 
know whether to surrender or buy you flowers."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
I have no idea how to respond to that. I'll take 
it as a compliment, I think?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I wish you could see my homeland. It might 
ease your restless search for deeper meaning."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 
The plains? I told you before, I would find 
simply staring at nature *fatally* boring."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Lyn] 
What about talking to me? Is that 
*fatally* boring?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Zelkov] 
Hm-hm. Interesting point. I admit our 
conversations are *sufficiently* entertaining."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Zelkov] 
You always seem so *leisurely.* I find it 
rather unsettling."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Lyn] 
A wanderer's at home wherever she goes. If I 
show some ""leisureliness,"" that's probably why."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 

[Lyn] 2 

[Zelkov] 
You grew up on the open plains, did you not? 
It must have been *fatally* boring."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Lyn] 
Not at all, actually. Nomads lead exciting lives. 
There's always something going on."
