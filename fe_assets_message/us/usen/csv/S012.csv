Angry 

[Alear] 
You seem much more focused─more intense 
than usual."

[Roy] Die 
[Roy] 
My sword, the Binding Blade, was kept in this 
land for centuries."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Roy] Status 
[Roy] 
My memory of retrieving it must be granting me 
additional power."
MID_BT1_#004,"[Alear] Strike 

[Alear] 
If a memory can grant power, then I'll give you 
a fight we'll both remember!"
MID_BT2_#001,"[Roy] b 
[Roy] 
Relax 
[Roy] 
Oh, you're to be my opponent? Well then, 
I'd best not relax."
MID_BT2_#002,"[Diamant] t 
[Diamant] Strike 
[Diamant] 
It pleases me that you would say so─I feel 
the same."
MID_BT2_#003,"[Diamant] 
It is my duty to show the Emblem entrusted 
to Brodia a spectacular fight!"
MID_BT2_#004,"[Roy] Status 
[Roy] 
This will be quite the battle then. Come on, 
Diamant. Fight!"
MID_BT3_#001,"[Alcryst] t 

[Alcryst] Sad 

[Alcryst] 
L-Lord Roy? Is there not someone more, um, 
adequate you should be fighting?"

[Roy] 
Smile 
[Roy] 
Why are you talking nonsense, Alcryst?"
MID_BT3_#003,"[Roy] Status 
[Roy] 
You are the prince of Brodia─the land I was 
entrusted to. Who better could I face?"
MID_BT3_#004,"[Roy] StandBy 
[Roy] 
Come. Let our battle begin!"
MID_ED1_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Thank you for entertaining my wish to fight. 
You're impressive."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
You would have won if I'd slipped up even once. 
I never want to have you as an enemy again."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Roy] 
Please, you're embarrassing me."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Roy] 
..."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alear] 
What's wrong, Roy? You're staring."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Roy] 
Oh... It's just that you remind me of somebody 
I once knew. Her name was Idunn."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Roy] 
She was a Demon Dragon, and King Zephiel of 
Bern wished to use her to destroy humanity."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Alear] 
A Demon Dragon?"
MID_ED1_#009,"[Roy] 
Like you, each of her eyes was of a different 
color. And she carried herself a bit like you too."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
I never knew there was such a person... Did you 
battle this Demon Dragon?"
MID_ED1_#011,"[Roy] 
Well, I had a choice: kill her and wipe out the 
dragons, or save her...the enemy of mankind."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Roy] 
Can you guess which I chose?"
MID_ED1_#013,"[Alear] 
Which was it?"
MID_ED1_#014,"[Roy] 
I'll tell you the whole tale once this war is over 
and your world is at peace."
MID_ED1_#015,"[Alear] 
Aww... OK, then. But you have to promise me 
you'll tell. I'm looking forward to the story."
MID_ED1_#016,"[Roy] 
I promise, . Until that day comes, 
I think we'll enjoy our time together."
MID_EV1_#001,"[Roy] b 
[Roy] 
Relax 
[Roy] 
I'm looking forward to seeing how you 
approach this battle."
MID_EV2_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
Is that the sound of huge wings?! It sounds 
like wyverns..."
MID_EV2_#002,"[Alear] 
They might be reinforcements for Roy's troops. 
I should advance with caution."

[Alear] 
Where are we? I don't recognize it."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Roy] 
It looks like... No, it couldn't be."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
Roy? Do you know this place?"
MID_OP1_#004,"[Roy] 
I may be seeing what I want to see, instead of 
what's truly there, but it's very similar..."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Roy] 
to a place where I once fought an important 
battle."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Alear] 
Oh. Do you mean in the world you're from? 
Could you tell me about it?"
MID_OP1_#007,"[Roy] 
I stood there, my allies at my side, facing down 
the armies of the kingdom of Bern."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Roy] 
The enemy's commander was Murdock, who 
was especially strong─tactically and physically."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Roy] 
His battle axe... The power and weight of its 
blows are etched forever in my memory."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Roy] 
It was a battle so grueling, I can hardly believe 
that I, or anyone else, managed to survive."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Roy] 
But bitter as it was, I hold fond memories of 
that day as well."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Alear] 
It must be an important point in time for you."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Roy] 
Yes, you could say that. I admit I feel a bit 
energized standing here."
MID_OP1_#014,"[Roy] 
, would you grant me an odd 
request? Battle me here, in this place."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Alear] 
Battle you? But why?"
MID_OP1_#016,"[Roy] 
This place is from my memory, but I believe it 
is a trial meant for you."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Roy] 
Achieve a glorious victory against me, and our 
bond will grow deeper still."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Roy] 
My power will grow, and yours will too. 
Are you interested?"
MID_OP1_#019,"[Alear] 
All right, I'll fight you. And I'll win."
