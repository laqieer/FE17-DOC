[Panette] 
Before eating, one must sit up straight and pray."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Panette] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Panette] 
Then, the humane customs of Firene dictate 
that I offer gratitude to the food itself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Panette] 
Giving thanks to the plants and animals that 
compose each meal. What a lovely tradition."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Boucheron] 
Ah... Are you practicing the etiquette we went 
over the other day?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Panette] 
I am! Please, observe."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Panette] 
Behold as I expertly wield a knife and fork to 
conquer this dish."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Panette] 
Using the outside utensils first... Cutting the 
food into small pieces..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Panette] 
Success!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Boucheron] 
Congratulations, Panette. You're still a little bit 
shaky, but this is progress."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Panette] 
Thank you, Boucheron."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Panette] 
My studies in etiquette were always marked by 
desperation. I wished to claw free from my past."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Panette] 
But with your tutelage, for the first time, I found 
it rather pleasant learning about manners."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Panette] 
My success is entirely thanks to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Oh no, you worked hard for this. I'm proud 
of you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Boucheron] 
I'd say it's my turn now to learn some 
Solmic etiquette."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Panette] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Boucheron] 
Don't tell me you don't remember. We agreed 
to teach each other our countries' ways."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Panette] 
Ah, yes. I remember."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Panette] 
Well, Solm is a free-spirited queendom. There is 
no strict code of conduct for nobles."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Panette] 
Rather, it is considered good manners to revel 
with others─to sing, dance, and be merry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Panette] 
Though of course, some situations call for a 
certain amount of propriety."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Boucheron] 
Huh... That's interesting."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Boucheron] 
Every country has its own customs, but I can 
see one point of common ground between ours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Panette] 
Kindness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Boucheron] 
Yes. That's the foundation of all etiquette, no 
matter what country you find yourself in."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Boucheron] 
And when it comes to that, Panette, you earn 
a perfect score."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Panette] 
As do you, dear Boucheron."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Boucheron] 
I never would have realized all this if you hadn't 
brought it up, so thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Panette] 
And thank you. It seems I am closer and closer 
to becoming the picture-perfect noblewoman."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Boucheron] 
By the way, there must be more to etiquette 
in Solm. I'm eager to learn."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Panette] 
Indeed! Let us continue our education on the art 
of kindness toward others. Together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Boucheron] 
When using knives and forks, start from the 
outside and work your way in."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Panette] 
Understood! Let us see here..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Panette] 
Pah... Pah! Why is Firenese food so slippery? 
It refuses to stay on my fork."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Boucheron] 
That piece is a bit too large. Use the knife to 
cut it smaller. It looks more graceful that way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Panette] 
Smaller pieces... Deuces, this is complicated."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Boucheron] 
I know you said you were nervous, but I didn't 
realize how little experience you had here."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Panette] 
Perhaps I ought to drink some water to calm 
my nerves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Panette] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Boucheron] 
Wait, no! That dish is meant for washing your 
hands, not to sip from!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Panette] 
Pah! How misleading!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Boucheron] 
How did you manage to eat meals with the 
Solmic royal family?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Panette] 
I always muddled through by mimicking others."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Boucheron] 
I suppose there's something to be said for that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Panette] 
Alas, perhaps proper etiquette is simply beyond 
my grasp."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Ahh, don't give up so easily. Everyone has a 
hard time learning these things."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Panette] 
In truth, my home life growing up was far 
from perfect."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Panette] 
How arrogant of me, assuming I could pass 
myself off as a noble."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Boucheron] 
The way you were raised isn't that important. 
If you want to learn, I'll teach you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Boucheron] 
You might make some mistakes here and there, 
but I'll help you, no matter how long it takes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Panette] 
Truly?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Boucheron] 
Of course. Correcting our mistakes is how we 
learn, after all. Let's try again from the start."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Panette] 
You're quite right. Look at me, hanging my head 
in defeat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Panette] 
From here on, I shall hold it high! I will not let 
you down, Boucheron!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Panette] 
Pardon, Boucheron. Have you a moment 
to spare?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Panette] 
Forgive me if this seems impertinent, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Panette] 
Are you the son of a Firenese count?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Boucheron] 
I am."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Panette] 
Marvelous! I wonder if, as a noble, you might 
deign to do me a favor."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Boucheron] 
I suppose so. What sort of favor?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Panette] 
Well, as you know, I serve the crown princess 
of Solm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Panette] 
To avoid embarrassing the royal family, I take 
pains to abide by the rules of high society."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Panette] 
Yet with respect to many noble customs, 
I remain rather...ill at ease."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Panette] 
Thus, I would like you to instruct me in the 
manners and etiquette of your homeland."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Boucheron] 
Sure. I can do that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Panette] 
Why, thank you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Boucheron] 
I've been curious about Solmic etiquette too."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Since we both serve our respective royal 
families, it might be fun to teach each other."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Panette] 
A splendid idea!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Panette] 
There is much to be learned, much to be taught!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Panette] 
I can scarcely wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Boucheron] 
Here's to education!"
