[Céline] 
Behold, Etie!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Céline] 
I tried adding honey to the single-origin tea, and 
I think I might have created something new."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Etie] 
Really? I'd like to try it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Etie] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Etie] 
Céline, this is incredible. I've never had anything 
like it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Céline] 
Heh heh, very impressive, Etie."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Etie] 
Impressive? What did I do?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Céline] 
Your hand no longer shakes. You've mastered 
your new teacup, haven't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Etie] 
Not exactly. I just switched to a regular 
porcelain one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Céline] 
Whatever for? Don't tell me you intend to 
abandon your training."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Etie] 
Oh, I'm still going to train. Just not during 
our teatimes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Céline] 
Forgive me, Etie. This is because I couldn't stop 
prying, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Etie] 
No, that's not why."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Etie] 
Training is important to me, but the time I get 
to spend with you is even more important."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Etie] 
It's OK to take a break during our teatime. 
I don't need to try to do both at once."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Céline] 
Oh! I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Etie] 
Every day, the war grinds us down."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Etie] 
I don't know how much longer I'll be able to 
simply relax with you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Etie] 
So, I think it's best I not spend our precious 
moments together training too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Etie] 
You OK there?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Céline] 
I'm touched, Etie, that you'd go so far out of 
your way for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Etie] 
Of course. Come on, Céline. Don't you know 
you're one of my best friends in the world?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Céline] 
I could say the same of you, Etie."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Etie] 
Thank you. That's a real honor."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Céline] 
Oh! You're shaking again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Etie] 
That's not from training. I'm just feeling a bit 
emotional is all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Céline] 
Oh, Etie. Come here. You can lean on me 
whenever you need."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Etie] 
Céline..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Céline] 
Hahaha... Not so tight, Etie."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Céline] 
Uh...urgh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Céline] 
Etie... You train too much. You're...crushing me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Céline] 2 

[Céline] 
The tea is perfect today too. Every moment of 
rest we get is a blessing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Etie] 
Yeah. There's so much to deal with that I need 
little moments like this to keep me sane."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Céline] 
Too true."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Etie] 
Do you remember our first teatimes together?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Céline] 
Not especially well. We've been having them 
for so long, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Céline] 
At the time, my brother's health was still very 
tenuous. Every day was nerve-wracking."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Etie] 
But all that stress toughened you up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Céline] 
I knew I had to be able to support my brother... 
in case of the worst."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Céline] 
But just as I was getting stronger, my brother's 
health vastly improved, thanks to his training."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Etie] 
Heh, I remember how good it felt to see two 
strong siblings, side by side."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Etie] 
After I became retainer to Prince Alfred, he 
urged me to train as well. And look at me now!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Céline] 
Uh...Etie?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Etie] 
Is something wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Céline] 
I definitely saw your hand trembling."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Etie] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Céline] 
Are you not feeling well? Have you fallen ill?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Etie] 
No, it's nothing like that. It's just that my teacup 
is pretty heavy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Céline] 
That much I knew already."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Céline] 
You've used a weighted teacup to build muscle 
ever since you became Alfred's retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Céline] 
But it never used to trouble you, and now you 
barely seem able to lift it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Etie] 
All right. Here's the thing, Céline..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Etie] 
I got a new teacup."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Céline] 
Pardon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Etie] 
Here, try holding it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Céline] 
Ah! Wh-what in the world?! I've handled 
cannonballs lighter than this!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Etie] 
I had it specially made. The old one wasn't 
enough of a workout anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Céline] 
Huh, no wonder your hand shakes, if you've 
been using this for a teacup."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Etie] 
Now you know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029,"[Céline] 
Thank goodness. If something were to happen 
to you, Etie, I don't think I'd ever recover."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#030,"[Etie] 
Aw, Céline. I'm sorry I worried you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#031,"[Céline] 
I'm fine, now that I know it's nothing serious. 
Teatime again soon, hmm?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Céline] 2 

[Etie] 
It's been a while since we had time for a cup 
of tea together, Princess Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Céline] 
There's no need to stand on ceremony, Etie. 
We've been friends too long for that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Etie] 
As you wish, Céline. How's your tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Céline] 
Most delicious, thank you. This is a lovely pot 
you've brewed for us."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Céline] 
The pungent aroma and flavor tell me it's a 
single-origin tea from the northern fields, yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Etie] 
You can tell where it's from with one sip? 
You really know your leaves."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Céline] 
Go on, Etie, try some. The aroma is really quite 
unlike anything else."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Etie] 
Thank you. Don't mind if I do."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Etie] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Céline] 
Well?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Etie] 
Well...it tastes like tea to me. You could tell me 
it's from any region and I'd believe you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Céline] 
Hm-hm, I thought as much. You always were 
a bit blind to the subtleties of tea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Etie] 
It's not that I can't taste it. It's that no one's 
on your level when it comes to this stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Céline] 
Hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Céline] 
Is something wrong, Etie?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Etie] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Céline] 
I noticed your hand trembling. There it is again."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Etie] 
Oh, uh... I don't think so. You must have 
imagined it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Céline] 
Really? Well, if you're sure..."
