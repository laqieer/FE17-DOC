[Hortensia] 
Here you go, Divine One─enjoy!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
Did you, uh, cook me something?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Yeah! And it's got spices that'll keep you warm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
I also gathered some healing herbs for you. 
Here you go."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
Um, thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
This is all great, but...what's going on?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Hortensia] 
You said something that opened my eyes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Hortensia] 
If I'm gonna be for-real charming, I need to 
practice helping people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Hortensia] 
I'm sorry for the way I acted before. Do you 
forgive me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
Of course. I was never upset with you to 
begin with."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Hortensia] 
I'm glad to hear that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Hortensia] 
Everyone loved my mother because she was 
both charming and kind."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Hortensia] 
I've got a long way to go to be like her."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Hortensia] 
But thanks for helping me figure that out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
You're welcome. And for what it's worth, 
I think you're well on your way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Hortensia] 
I have to wonder, though... If I do become truly 
charming, inside and out..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Hortensia] 
How are you gonna keep pretending you don't 
care about cuteness, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
I'll figure something out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Ha! I dunno about that! I think you just might 
change your tune!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
We'll see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Hey, Divine One! What do you think of me 
this time?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Hortensia] 
I went out of my way to be extra-super cute."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Hortensia] 
So, are you ready to concede defeat and admit 
that you're completely charmed?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
You certainly are cute. And I'm sure you put in 
a lot of work for it, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
I told you before that cuteness doesn't affect 
how I treat people. Why are you fixated on this?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Hortensia] 
I didn't want to bring it up, but...OK."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Hortensia] 
My mother was one of the king's mistresses. 
She suffered a lot of backstabbing in the court."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Hortensia] 
I never saw her upset, though. She took every 
insult with a poised and graceful smile."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Hortensia] 
That smile secured her place in court. It even 
won the king's wife over."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Hortensia] 
That's how I know charm has a power all its 
own. And I'm gonna use mine the same way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alear] 
I understand. But can I ask you something?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
Do you think maybe your mother had more than 
just her own survival in mind?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Hortensia] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
Maybe she did all of that in part so you could 
learn to survive the court as well."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
She must have known she couldn't always be 
there for you. She'd want you to learn from her."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
To me, that is real charm─what we do to help 
the ones we love."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Mother... I never realized..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Hey, Divine One! What do you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Of what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Come on! Am I cute? Sweet? Charming? 
Use your words!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
Sure, you're cute enough. Just like always."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Hortensia] 
That's all you have to say? I put a lot of effort 
into being adorable, y'know."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
The least you could do is notice!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
I had no idea. Uh, forgive me for not noticing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Hortensia] 
That's all I get? Hmph..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Hortensia] 
I can't believe that didn't work. A pouty face is 
usually all it takes for people to be extra nice."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Do you have some kinda god training that lets 
you see through fake crying, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
God training?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
I don't think anyone needs special training to 
see through an act like that..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Hortensia] 
Hey! Fine, then let me ask you something else."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Hortensia] 
How come you're not fawning over me? 
I'm unimaginably cute!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
I don't treat people differently just because 
they're cute. Kindness matters much more."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Hortensia] 
Wrong! Being nice is great and all, but cuteness 
is a huge advantage. Everyone knows that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alear] 
I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Hortensia] 
So, we'll try this again─only I'll be even cuter 
next time, so you can't possibly miss it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 

[Alear] 
You seem to be in high spirits lately, Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Hortensia] 
Yeah, I am. Turns out being kind to people 
makes them happy. And that makes me happy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
That does explain why you're constantly 
surrounded by friends these days."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Hortensia] 
I guess so. Hey, hang on. What's that I hear?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Hortensia] 
Am I picking up a hint of jealousy in your voice, 
Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
What? Of course not!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Hortensia] 
Hehe, I can't believe the Divine Dragon's 
actually jealous of me. What an ego boost."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Hortensia] 
But you have nothing to worry about. However 
popular I may get, I'll always make time for you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Because you're special to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
I am?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Hortensia] 
AHH! All my graceful composure destroyed by 
one moment of weakness!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Hortensia] 
Can we just pretend you didn't hear that?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
Not a chance!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Merciless."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
You were right, Hortensia. I was jealous."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
I've always enjoyed our time together. I'm sad 
to have less of it now that you're so popular."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
Understanding all this makes it clear what 
I need to do next."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Hortensia] 
That's...the Pact Ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Hortensia] 
You're giving it to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Hortensia] 
I can't even begin to tell you what this means 
to me. I'll treasure it forever."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
I'm in awe of what a wonderful person 
you've become."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
So much so, in fact, that I feel I need to start 
working on my own kindness just to keep up."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Hortensia] 
Don't be ridiculous. You've been amazing since 
the day we met."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Hortensia] 
And you've only become even more amazing 
in the time since."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
Haha, keep saying that sort of thing and you 
might actually convince me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Hortensia] 
Good. The sooner the better."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Hortensia] 
Because if all that wasn't true, you wouldn't be 
so special to me."
