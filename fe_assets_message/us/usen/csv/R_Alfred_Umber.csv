[Amber] 
Morning, Prince Alfred!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
Morning, Amber!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Amber] 
You're up pretty early again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alfred] 
It's never too early for a workout."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Amber] 
You're amazing, Prince Alfred. You never miss 
a day of training, do you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Amber] 
I don't know how you do it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alfred] 
It's simple─workouts are fun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alfred] 
It's like you and your myth-chasing. Even when 
that gets tough, you never give up, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Amber] 
Huh. Yeah, that's true."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alfred] 
Besides, I can't afford not to stay in shape."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Amber] 
Oh, sure! Because we're in the middle of a war."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alfred] 
True! But I'm looking ahead to after the 
war too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Amber] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alfred] 
What? Did you forget the dream already?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Amber] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alfred] 
At the peak of some far-off mountain is every 
weight lifter's dream."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alfred] 
If I'm gonna build the strength to get there, 
I've gotta start training now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Amber] 
Wait, you mean the Suprotein legend? I thought 
you gave up on that!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alfred] 
Nah, I put it on hold. Big difference. I might still 
go after it once the war's done."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alfred] 
It's a reason to keep going. Can't fall before I 
get my hands on the prize, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Amber] 
But...Prince Alfred..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Amber] 
You'd do all this prep when there isn't a single 
shred of evidence that Suprotein is real?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alfred] 
It doesn't matter. A dream's not about facts. 
It's about believing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Amber] 
Yes! Totally! That's exactly how I feel!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Amber] 
Chasing legends is the best!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alfred] 
Haha, I'm just having fun in life. That's all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Amber] 
Me too! I want to have that exact kind of fun! 
Can I train with you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Amber] 
I also believe in Suprotein...so let me chase that 
legend too!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Alfred] 
Sure! I'd love to have you aboard."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Alfred] 
We may be from different kingdoms, but we 
can still share the same dream."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Amber] 
Prince Alfred, if you get any cooler, my head's 
gonna explode!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Amber] 2 

[Amber] 
Even the sharpest lance will bend and warp. 
A thousand arrows will bounce right off."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Just one of these pills will turn your muscles to 
pure steel and your body into a fortress."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Amber] 
That's the power of the legendary muscle- 
boosting medicine...Suprotein!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alfred] 
Suprotein?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Amber] 
Yep."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alfred] 
Not doubting you here, but...that name makes 
this whole thing seem unbelievable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Amber] 
Oh-ho! But that's exactly how legends work."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Amber] 
Bizarre names. Vague clues. Following your gut 
instincts into the unknown..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Amber] 
This is how legends transform into epic quests!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Amber] 
What's it gonna be, Prince Alfred?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Amber] 
Are you ready to follow your dreams and 
embark on the adventure of a lifetime?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Amber] 
This quest is worth undertaking as long as you 
believe it is! Do you believe, Prince Alfred?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alfred] 
You're darn right I believe! You've worked too 
hard tracking this down for me to doubt you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alfred] 
All right then, where do we find this Suprotein?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Amber] 
OK, I have everything we need to get started."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Amber] 
Let's see... From here, it'll take about a year to 
reach the medicine's location."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alfred] 
Why so long?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Amber] 
It comes in a pill that can only be found on this 
one mountaintop that pokes above the clouds."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alfred] 
This doesn't sound like an easy trip. I don't 
think now is the time for me to be ducking out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alfred] 
I hate to say it, but I might have to put this 
muscle quest on hold for now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Amber] 
Oh. I guess you're right. Man, I really hyped this 
one up without thinking, huh? Sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alfred] 
What are you talking about? You just gave me 
the best gift of all!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Amber] 
I did?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alfred] 
Something to work toward─a dream."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Amber] 
Whoa! Yes, Prince Alfred! I love that!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Alfred] 
Haha, glad you're back on board."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Amber] 2 
[Alfred] 
Amber, got a sec?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Amber] 
Sure, Prince Alfred. What's up?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alfred] 
People tell me you know a lot."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alfred] 
Especially when it comes to rumors and myth."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Amber] 
Oh, totally! All legends are true if you choose to 
believe them...and I believe a LOT of 'em."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alfred] 
Well, there's something I always wondered that 
maybe you could help me with."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alfred] 
Have you ever heard a legend about a kind of 
medicine that makes you ultra-muscular?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Amber] 
Muscular?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
No, ULTRA-muscular."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Amber] 
Huh... No, I don't think I've heard that legend."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alfred] 
Damn. I thought if anybody might know more, 
it'd be you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Amber] 
Well, now that I've heard about it from you, 
I can't just ignore it. I have to know!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Amber] 
I'll uncover the legend of that muscle-boosting 
medicine no matter what!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alfred] 
Really? You're a peach, Amber!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Amber] 
Aw, no sweat. I live for this lore-y, 
legend-y stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Amber] 
I'll start poking around right now!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Amber] 
Hey, muscles! Yeah, you with the big arms! 
How'd you get so huge?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Amber] 
[Alfred] 
Now we're getting somewhere. If there's anyone 
you can trust to get it done, it's Amber!"
