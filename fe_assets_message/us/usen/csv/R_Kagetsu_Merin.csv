[Merrin] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Try this!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Merrin] 
Ha! Not good enough, Kagetsu!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
Ha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Merrin] 
And that's that. I win."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
I...lost?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Merrin] 
You did. Though, you are just as skilled as I am. 
In fact, you might even be stronger than me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Merrin] 
But I've sworn to protect my princess. And the 
power of my conviction will not be overcome."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
Conviction, you say..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Merrin] 
I won, Kagetsu. You will not challenge Princess 
Timerra, you understand?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes... It will be as we agreed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
But perhaps you would consider rematching 
me yourself?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Merrin] 
You want to fight me again? Do you mean...as a 
substitute for my princess?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
No, that is not what I mean."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
I have become interested in your power 
of conviction."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
It clearly gives you great strength."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
Studying this will teach me much about your 
culture and the world, I feel!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Merrin] 
Ah, in that case, yes. I'd be happy to spar with 
you as much as you like."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Merrin] 
In fact, sparring with you will make excellent 
training for me as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
Marvelous! Then let us consider each other 
training partners from today!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
I am certain this will lead to deep and 
meaningful bonds of friendship!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Merrin] 
Haha, I'd like that very much, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Merrin. Do I have your permission to issue 
my challenge to Princess Timerra yet?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Merrin] 
Please. You'll never have my permission."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
Truly? I am greatly vexed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
Still, I am in your debt, Merrin. Out of respect, 
I will wait until you change your mind."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Merrin] 
You're very aggravating, you know that? Why 
must you insist on fighting my princess?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
I have journeyed far from Pale Sands in search 
of strong opponents to face in battle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Merrin] 
Pale Sands... You mean the remote region in 
Solm? The one shrouded in mystery?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
To me, it is everything outside of Pale Sands 
that is shrouded in mystery."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
That is why I set out on my journey─to explore 
the strange world outside my home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
I have met many strong opponents in 
my travels."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
I have also seen how each country's customs, 
culture, and history inform its fighters."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
This is why I seek a duel with Princess Timerra. 
I wish to learn more about Solm!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Merrin] 
So that's what this is all about."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Merrin] 
In that case, I will fight you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
You?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Merrin] 
I am a royal knight, and a capable one at that. 
Do you doubt I'd make a worthy opponent?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
I do not doubt it. But should I defeat you, I will 
challenge Princess Timerra next."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
Do you have any objections?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Merrin] 
Fine by me. But just a heads-up...you will not 
defeat me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
Haha, your confidence is delightful. Come then, 
show me what you can do!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Kagetsu] 
Aw..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
How could I be so foolish? Dropping my onigiri, 
my one and only lunch... What do I do?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
I had so much to do today. Now I fear I will 
collapse from hunger..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
You look like you could use a snack. Do you 
like sweets? I have some to share."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Merrin?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
You would help me in my hour of need? 
My gratitude knows no bounds..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
With all my heart, thank you..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Merrin] 
You're very welcome. Enjoy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
Sweet... And delicious! Oh, now I am full 
of energy!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Merrin] 
Wow, you devoured those. You must've been 
very hungry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes! That hit all my spots. Thank you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
Now I can challenge Princess Timerra to single 
combat without worry!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Merrin] 
Excuse me?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Merrin] 
You're going to challenge my princess to a 
fight? No! No, you certainly will not!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
Why not? Fighting strong opponents is fun."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
I have some skill, so I think Princess Timerra 
will find our duel challenging."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Merrin] 
Yes, well, as retainer to Princess Timerra, I will 
not allow you to put her in harm's way."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
You are much too worried."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Merrin] 
To think, I helped someone who wants to attack 
my princess. What a truly unforgivable mistake."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Merrin] 
If you insist on fighting her, you'll have to 
defeat me first!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
I would gladly take you on."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
Ordinarily, at least. But I would not feel right 
about repaying you so roughly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Kagetsu] 
Very well, Merrin. You have persuaded me 
to step back from this for now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Merrin] 
Huh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025,"[Kagetsu] 
You are so wary! I am not lying!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026,"[Kagetsu] 
My contest with Princess Timerra will simply 
have to wait until another time."
