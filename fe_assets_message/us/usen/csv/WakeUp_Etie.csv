MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,How'd you like the scent of Firene?
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,"Someday I'll take you to a whole field full 
of those beauties."
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,OK... Let's do this nice and quiet.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002,Easy does it.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,You're already up?!
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,I thought for sure...
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,I was lighter on my feet than that!
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,I brought you my favorite Firenese flower.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,No nicer smell in the world.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,This should be good to wake up to.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,I think you should try...
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,the spicy pepper scent.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,It'll pep you right up...
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004,so it's perfect for mornings.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,"I made breakfast for you, Divine One!"
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,Looks like food's the key to getting you up fast.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,"Well, feast your eyes! I made sure there was 
plenty of protein."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,Have you been using the muscle balm?
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,It comes in different scents!
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,"There's peach, cookie, and tons of different 
herbs. There's even one that smells like tea."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,Nope! No good!
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,"Why's that thing so heavy, Divine One?"
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,I'd better train harder for next time.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,Here I am to get you up and moving.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,You woke up right away.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,"Are you actually a light sleeper, Divine One?"
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,What's the best way to do this?
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,"I'd give you a nudge, but..."
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,"that just feels rude. I'll nudge the altar you're 
sleeping on instead. Ugh!"
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,Morning.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,Feeling groggy?
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,"There's no better cure for that than a run. 
What do you say?"
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,"Phew! That's a hundred laps around 
the Somniel!"
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,You got right up.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,That mean you wanna run too?
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,I could handle some more laps.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,You know...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,I'm even more into running now.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,"I've left all those pesky lingering doubts in 
the dust."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,Morning!
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,"C'mon, open up those eyes."
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,Hello!
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,"Rested up, Divine One?"
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,Glad to hear it.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,The weather's great today...
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,so don't sleep through it!
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,Let's go! Get that blood flowing!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,"Ah... Oh, hey!"
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,Didn't see you wake up.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,"Fine morning, isn't it?"
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,"Let's make this quick, Divine One. I've got a lot 
to do."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,"Great, you're up. So, are we done here?"
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,"If that's all you need, I'm gonna go for my run."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,Since I'm waiting anyway...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,I'll start my routine now.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,Hyah! Ngh! Hyah! Ngh!
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,"In the meantime, I'll press one of my favorite 
flowers for you."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,"Maybe I'll pin it, too, so you can wear it. I think 
that'd look nice."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,Hey! Your partner's here to wake you!
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,"Aw, you're already up? What a shame."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,I had something really nice all planned out.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,"Hah, of course I know how to be nice!"
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,"I've been wanting to show you Firene's 
gorgeous flower fields..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,"but there's not a lot of time for sightseeing 
with the war and all."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,I could have flowers delivered here.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,"But even if I filled the room with them, it 
wouldn't be the same."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,"Someday, though..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,we'll see those fields together. Promise.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Morning! Ready to get moving?
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,All's right with the world...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,when we're running side by side.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,Time for our morning run!
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002,"Wake up, sleepyhead."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,"Good, you're awake. Ready to go?"
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,Let's start with some stretches...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,"and a few warm-up laps. Then we'll pick up 
the pace."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,I took a few laps on my own before I came here.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,Sort of like you were doing for a while.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,"Running alone is fine and all, but it's starting to 
feel wrong to go without you."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,"I'm just so much stronger when I have my friend 
and partner with me."
