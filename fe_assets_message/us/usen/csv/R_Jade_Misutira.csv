ミスティラI can't believe we still couldn't find 
any minerals."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Jade] 
Indeed. All of the local mines seem to 
be exhausted..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Jade] 
If we'd gotten there a bit sooner, we might have 
found something...but it's hard to say."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
Guh...I just want a couple of jewels. Is that so 
much to ask?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Timerra] 
I got so pumped about you wearing one. Bet it 
would have looked great."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jade] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Timerra] 
Hey, are you laughing?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jade] 
I am."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Jade] 
Not at anything in particular. I'm just happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Timerra] 
About what?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jade] 
I'm happy that you're thinking of me like this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jade] 
You said you wanted to find jewels for yourself, 
but now you're focused on finding one for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Jade] 
I'm just taking a moment to...enjoy the feeling."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Timerra] 
Hey, hey! Look at you, getting all mushy on me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Timerra] 
I just think you deserve some extra beauty in 
your life, you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Jade] 
I appreciate that very much, Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Timerra] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Timerra] 
Nope, not letting it end like this. Come on, we're 
going to a jeweler right now!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Jade] 
Huh? You're just going to buy jewels now? 
After all of our searching?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Jade] 
Heh."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Timerra] 
Hehe, yup. I've officially given up on the 
old-fashioned way. Is that bad?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Jade] 
Not at all. Besides, we didn't need to find a rare 
gem. I've been standing beside one all along."

[Timerra] 
Welp, the mineral hunt came up empty."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Jade] 
Sorry, Princess Timerra. I did worry we might 
walk away empty-handed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Timerra] 
Nah, don't sweat it. It was still fun exploring 
the mine with you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Timerra] 
Honestly, if you've got time, I'd love to give it 
another try someday soon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jade] 
Of course. I'll accompany you as many times 
as you'd like."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Timerra] 
Hey, here's an idea."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Timerra] 
If we get a big chunk of mineral, let's polish it 
up nice and cut it into two matching jewels!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Timerra] 
That way, you and me have sparkling mementos 
for our friendship. Great idea, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Jade] 
A jewel for me? I feel like that would be a bit 
of a waste, to be honest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Timerra] 
Huh? What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Timerra] 
Now that I think about it...you don't really wear 
jewels, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Jade] 
No, I don't."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Jade] 
For me, jewels aren't something to be worn. 
They're something to protect."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jade] 
I used to be a guard at my hometown's local 
mine. Bandits were a constant nuisance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Jade] 
That's why I wouldn't be able to enjoy wearing 
one. My instinct would be to lock it away."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Timerra] 
Wow. ""Waste"" is right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jade] 
Yes, exactly. I'm glad you understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Timerra] 
No! What I mean is, it's a waste for such a 
beauty not to wear jewels!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Timerra] 
That settles it. We're going to march back there 
and get the prettiest gems you ever saw."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Timerra] 
And so help me, you're gonna wear yours!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Jade] 1

[Timerra] 
Hey, Jade! Got a sec?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jade] 
Certainly, Princess Timerra. What do you need?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Timerra] 
I hear that you're from a mining town, so you 
know a lot about minerals and stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Jade] 
That's right. My father was a gemologist, so I 
picked up a fair bit of knowledge."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Timerra] 
Perfect! Seeing as you're such an expert, want 
to go mineral hunting with me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jade] 
You're going mineral hunting?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Timerra] 
Yup!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Timerra] 
See, I'm on the hunt for a big, fabulous 
jewel-to-be."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Timerra] 
I already have a place in mind, but I'm not sure 
how to go about finding a gem there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Jade] 
Ah, I understand why you came to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jade] 
I wouldn't mind joining you, but...if you're 
interested in jewels, why not visit a jeweler?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Jade] 
You are royalty, after all. I'm sure they'd sell 
you as many rare stones as you want."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Timerra] 
Yeah, but that's no fun."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Timerra] 
I'd much rather find one for myself. You know, 
do it the old-fashioned way!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Jade] 
I see. That's a rare perspective."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jade] 
Well if that's the plan, I'll be happy to 
guide you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Jade] 
I'll take a few notes along the way. I might be 
able to mine some ideas for my next novel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Timerra] 
Perfect! I get a dazzling jewel, and you get a 
dazzling protagonist. Win, win!"
