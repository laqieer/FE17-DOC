[Diamant] 
Prince Alfred, may I speak with you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
Sure thing, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
Let's find a quiet spot."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Diamant] 
This needs to be a private conversation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alfred] 
Now that we're settled, what's the big deal?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Diamant] 
Prince Alfred, I share the following concern not 
as a friend...but as the crown prince of Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alfred] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Diamant] 
As you know, the kingdom of Brodia prioritizes 
military might above all else."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Diamant] 
Our kingdom is home to many ambitious people. 
That might explain those priorities."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Diamant] 
Our culture also teaches that it's honorable to 
gain things by force."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alfred] 
Go on..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Diamant] 
Thanks to Queen Ève, our two kingdoms have 
signed a nonaggression pact. However..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alfred] 
You're saying you can't promise it'll last."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Diamant] 
That's right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alfred] 
What do you think will happen?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Diamant] 
I have my own hopes, but I won't just force 
them upon my kingdom."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Diamant] 
The will of my people must come first. I have to 
fight for whatever future serves them best."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alfred] 
I understand. I'm in the same tight spot."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alfred] 
That said, everything'll be fine. You've got 
nothing to worry about."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Diamant] 
How can you be sure?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alfred] 
Well, I mean... Everyone from Brodia seems 
so nice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Diamant] 
I'm not sure if you're joking."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alfred] 
I can't speak for the whole kingdom, but all the 
Brodians I've met were nice enough."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Alfred] 
I don't think they want a war over nothing. 
I think things are gonna work out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alfred] 
I trust the good folks of Brodia that way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Diamant] 
You trust in the goodwill of others? Even the 
citizens of neighboring kingdoms?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Alfred] 
People are people, no matter where they're 
from. Is trusting in them so bad?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Diamant] 
Haha."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Diamant] 
No, it's not bad at all. In fact, trust might be the 
most important quality for a leader to have."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Alfred] 
Heh heh, I'm with you on that one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Diamant] 
I'm glad to have met you, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Diamant] 
Here's to our growing friendship─and trust─as 
fellow crown princes of allied kingdoms."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Alfred] 
Looking forward to working with you, 
Prince Diamant!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Alfred] 
I think this is the start of something beautiful 
between our kingdoms. And between us."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Diamant] 2 
[Alfred] 
Hey there, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Diamant] 
Prince Alfred! Are you on your way to another 
workout session?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alfred] 
Yep! I thought I'd ask if you wanted to tag 
along. Is this a bad time?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Diamant] 
It's a great time. I was just getting ready for 
some exercise myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alfred] 
Nice. So let's head on over."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alfred] 
HYAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Diamant] 
Hgh! HYAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alfred] 
Agh! That all you got?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Diamant] 
Ha! Hardly. Let's see how you handle this!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alfred] 
I'm...ready to call it a day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Diamant] 
I think I am too. That was really great."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Diamant] 
It's funny..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Diamant] 
I never thought I'd end up crossing swords with 
a rival prince outside of a battlefield."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alfred] 
Heh, while smiling, at that. It was a good 
workout."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Diamant] 
I know our kingdoms signed a nonaggression 
pact, but I never pictured this as an outcome."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Diamant] 
It was...nice."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alfred] 
Come on! You can do better than, ""It was nice."" 
What about this?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alfred] 
""It was better than I could've dreamed!"" 
That's the way I'd put it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Diamant] 
Haha, that sounds about right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Diamant] 
If our countries hadn't become allies in this war, 
we wouldn't have been able to spar together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Diamant] 
I suppose that's something to be thankful for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alfred] 
There you go! That's thinking positive."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Diamant] 
It's nice to think that the two of us will come 
out of this war as friends."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Alfred] 
Hate to break it to you, but I'm not so sure 
that's possible. Things won't always be like this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Diamant] 
They won't?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Alfred] 
Afraid not. By the time the war's over...we'll be 
even better buddies!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029,"[Diamant] 
Haha! I like the way you think, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1

[Alfred] 
Good morning, Prince Diamant. I see that 
you're an early riser, like myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Diamant] 
Not quite, Prince Alfred. ""Night owl into early 
bird"" would be more accurate."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alfred] 
You mean you've been up all night?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Diamant] 
That's right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Diamant] 
I sat down to handle a pressing task before bed. 
Next thing I knew, I was watching the sunrise."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alfred] 
What was it you were doing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Diamant] 
I was drafting requests for funding to send to 
Brodia's nobles. Our military needs support."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Diamant] 
Any loans will be used as political leverage in 
the future. I'm worried...but out of options."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
Huh. I mean, I see. I can sympathize with 
your plight."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alfred] 
Every crown prince has the same troubles, it 
seems, no matter what realm they rule."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Diamant] 
Hmm... I don't doubt it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alfred] 
Well then. I must carry on with my 
morning patrol."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Diamant] 
Would you mind if I joined you? It would be 
foolish of me to try to sleep now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Diamant] 
A walk and talk with the prince of a neighboring 
kingdom sounds much more enjoyable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alfred] 
That's kind of you. Sad that we only get the 
opportunity during hard times, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alfred] 
But a long walk might be just the thing we need 
to get to know each other."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alfred] 
Let me start with a question for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alfred] 
What's your favorite muscle?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Diamant] 
What? Haha, that's your opener?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alfred] 
Oh, whoops."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Alfred] 
I was trying so hard to keep up the act, but I 
guess I blew it with that question."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Diamant] 
No, you're fine. I think I'll take a page from you, 
actually. I could stand to be a little less formal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Alfred] 
No fooling? Aw, that'd be swell, 
Prince Diamant!"
