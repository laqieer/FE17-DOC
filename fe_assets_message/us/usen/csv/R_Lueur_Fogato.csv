[Alear] 
Well, well. Training hard again, I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Fogado] 
Divine One, what are you doing here?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
I thought you agreed to forget what you saw. 
So, why did you come back?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
It's just, you've been training so hard and in 
secret... I thought you could use some company."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Fogado] 
Hahaha! The Divine One worrying about me? 
How'd I get so lucky?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
Fogado, I'd like to do something nice for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Fogado] 
Eh, I appreciate the gesture, but I'm kind of 
a prince, so there's really not much I need."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
How about that dinner you wanted? Let's have 
a meal and get to know each other better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Fogado] 
You want to have dinner? And, uh, eat it 
together?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
I do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Fogado] 
I can't say I'm not tempted. I mean, dinner with 
a dragon! But..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Fogado] 
I can't right now. Sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alear] 
You're turning me down? Ouch."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Fogado] 
No, no! It's just...dinner with you is like the 
ultimate reward, and I haven't earned it yet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Fogado] 
I want to keep that carrot dangling for a while─ 
give myself something to strive for."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
I see. I just hope it lives up to your expectations. 
I'll be ready when you are."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Fogado] 
Thanks. Well then, it's back to work for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Fogado] 
Bringing the best banter in Solm to the 
Sentinels─and to my people!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Fogado] 
Whew. Guess I should call it a day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
You know, for a self-proclaimed rascal, you sure 
seem devoted to working out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Fogado] 
Huh?! How long have you been standing there?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
Long enough. I bet the Sentinels would be 
inspired if they knew how hard you trained."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Fogado] 
No, they wouldn't. And you're going to keep 
your trap shut about what you saw here today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
Why? Training isn't something to be 
embarrassed about."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Fogado] 
It's not that. I just have a reputation to 
maintain, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Fogado] 
Everyone thinks I'm so easy-going. I gotta make 
sure it stays that way so people stay happy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
I'm...not following."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Fogado] 
If the Sentinels saw how hard I work to get in 
fighting shape, they'd stress over keeping up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Fogado] 
Worry, fear, exhaustion─that stuff is 
contagious, you know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Fogado] 
Hence the unfailing good cheer. It's on me to 
stay positive and upbeat for everyone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
Wow. I guess I had you all wrong. I'm sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
As you said, I'll keep my trap shut."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Fogado] 
Thanks, Divine One. I appreciate that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
You are certainly full of surprises, Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Alear] 
Fogado, I want to thank you and the Sentinels 
for your hard work today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Fogado] 
Haha, hard? That was nothin'."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Fogado] 
We didn't have to resolve a single quarrel, and 
there were barely any Corrupted around."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Fogado] 
I only wish every day was like this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
You're so easy-going...all the time. That must be 
why your people love you so much."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alear] 
As your ally, I certainly enjoy working with 
someone so unflappable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Fogado] 
Unflappable, eh? Ooo, I think I feel a blush 
coming on."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Fogado] 
But thanks for the compliment. How about we 
grab dinner together sometime?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
Dinner?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Fogado] 
Yeah! You, me, and some hard-hitting questions. 
Like...who is your very best friend and why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
Um, that's pretty personal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Fogado] 
You could tell me a super-secret wish─you 
know, one you're too embarrassed to reveal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
No! That's even worse."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
Look, as much as I enjoy your devil-may-care 
attitude, the banter is a bit much."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Fogado] 
You'd rather I be all boring and serious? Nah. 
I wouldn't be me if I wasn't a rascal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
I suppose you're right. It is hard to imagine you 
without that carefree personality of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
It may be your most likable trait."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Alear] 
The food was incredible, Fogado. And the 
restaurant was superb as well."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Fogado] 
Yep, dinner with a dragon was everything I 
hoped it would be. Well worth the wait, for sure."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
There's so much going on, I'm just glad we 
could make this meal together happen."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Fogado] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Fogado] 
There is something else I wish we could 
make happen."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
There is? Hmm, is it a super-secret wish you're 
too embarrassed to reveal, perhaps?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Fogado] 
No, no, nothing like that."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Fogado] 
Actually, maybe it kind of is. My wish is...well..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Fogado] 
Divine One, I wish we could be allies from 
here on out, you know? I mean, forever."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
You do?! Well, huh..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Fogado] 
This isn't rascal talk. This is serious talk. I've 
never worked so hard to earn a dinner!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
I didn't know you felt like this. I really didn't."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Fogado] 
I wasn't planning to tell you. I figured I'd just 
keep it a secret forever."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
You do seem to like your secrets."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
How many secrets do you have? For all I know, 
you've asked everyone to be your ally forever."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Fogado] 
No! No way! I'm careful about who I keep close. 
You're the only one I've ever asked."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
Haha, I'm kidding. I just wanted to give you 
a hard time."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
I know the easy-going rascal isn't all there is to 
you. I see how solid and genuine you really are."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
That's why I want you to have this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Fogado] 
The Pact Ring? But, Divine One, this means..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
It means I can grant your super-secret wish. If 
you want to be allies for all time, I do too."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
I guess I like my secrets too, because I've been 
thinking about this for quite a while, Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Fogado] 
Really? I'm so honored and just plain...happy!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Good. And so you know, I think the real Fogado 
is amazing. You can always be you with me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Fogado] 
Thank you, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Fogado] 
I promise, this easy-going rascal will be your 
solid and genuine ally for all time."
