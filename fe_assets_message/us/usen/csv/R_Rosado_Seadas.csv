[Rosado] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Rosado] 
The roast chicken's delicious today. Want 
some, Seadall?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
O spirit of the cards! Cast your divine light and 
reveal Rosado's beauty secret to me..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Seadall] 
No one can be that beautiful and not have 
a trick up their sleeve!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Seadall] 
He...he lives as he pleases, and he eats as 
he pleases!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Seadall] 
And here I am, being so particular for the sake 
of my dancing─foregoing flavor."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Seadall] 
Spirit of the cards, are you really and truly and 
totally certain he does nothing at all special?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Rosado] 
Hahah! Have you been studying my routine?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Rosado] 
If so, you shouldn't need to ask─you've already 
seen that I don't do anything special."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Seadall] 
I suppose you're right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Seadall] 
Rosado, it's just incredible that you do nothing 
at all and yet always look so...good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Rosado] 
And no need to be jealous of me. You can live 
however you want too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Seadall] 
That's the secret─living however I want?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Seadall] 
Hm. Is avoiding the sorts of food I truly like 
actually taking a toll on my dancing?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Seadall] 
Perhaps the secret to looking and feeling great 
is just...living a life guided by one's desires."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Seadall] 
All my focus on flavorlessness is taking the 
flavor out of my artistry!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Seadall] 
That's it! It has to be! Rosado's way of life 
proves it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Seadall] 
All right, then, I'm not going to deny myself 
the things I love anymore!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Seadall] 
I'll eat roast chicken dipped in all kinds of honey 
sauce. Sweet! Spicy! Extra-sweet! Extra-spicy!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Seadall] 
From here on out, I'm going to eat whatever my 
heart desires and sleep whenever I want!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Rosado] 
Hope he doesn't overdo it. Too much of 
anything is no good for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Rosado] 
Ah, well..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Rosado] 
No harm letting him indulge himself a while. 
The important thing right now is he's happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Rosado] 
He'll figure out the rest as he goes!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Rosado] 
Zzz... zzz..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
All right, then. Rosado is taking a nap."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Rosado] 
...Mmm...cute..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Seadall] 
He must have some kind of secret beauty 
regimen. I mean, just look at him."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Seadall] 
Though, I have been keeping an eye on him 
and I still can't figure out what it could be."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Rosado] 
...Mmm...hehe... Mmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Seadall] 
Ugh, what a terrible position to sleep in. 
Absolutely awful for one's posture."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Seadall] 
Hmm... Sleep is supposed to be good for the 
skin. But that can't be it. Everyone sleeps."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Seadall] 
I must remain patient─he's bound to do 
something interesting soon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Rosado] 
I feel great this morning!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Seadall] 
So, he just woke up and now he's washing his 
face. I'll finally learn his secret."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Seadall] 
With skin that dewy, he must be using a 
special moisturizer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Seadall] 
What could it be? I have to know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Rosado] 
♪Hmm-hmm!♪"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Seadall] 
How strange. No moisturizer...at all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Seadall] 
He washed his face and then just moved right 
on to washing his hair."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Seadall] 
And he's not even using shampoo."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Rosado] 
Nice and refreshed! Now, time to find 
some breakfast."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Seadall] 
What? No oil-infused conditioner or scented 
styling cream? He─ He didn't even dry it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Seadall] 
Is this really happening? Does Rosado truly 
have no special beauty routine?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Seadall] 
No... I bet it has something to do with what he 
eats. Surely that's his beauty trick."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Seadall] 
I will not give up until I figure this out. If Rosado 
can look that...incredible...so can I."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Rosado] 
You can look. I don't mind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Seadall] 
Uh, what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Rosado] 
You've kinda been staring at me. It's OK. I know 
I'm adorable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Rosado] 
You were admiring my cuteness, right? 
Admire away."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Seadall] 
Oh, well, I suppose you're not wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Seadall] 
I do appreciate the way you take care of 
yourself and your appearance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Seadall] 
Your hair is so shiny, it practically glows. 
And your skin...it's the picture of health."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Seadall] 
I'm dying to know what your beauty secret is."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Rosado] 
Haha! Aw, thanks so much!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Rosado] 
I don't have any beauty secrets, though."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Seadall] 
That's...not possible."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Seadall] 
You have to be doing something. Watching what 
you eat, exercising vigorously─something."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Seadall] 
It's not possible to look like...you...without 
putting in some kind of effort."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Seadall] 
If you're telling the truth, it's just not fair. 
I put a lot of work into being...me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Rosado] 
I don't know what to tell you. I really don't do 
anything special."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Seadall] 
Please."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Seadall] 
Maybe it's something you're not aware of...or 
maybe you're just keeping your secret from me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Seadall] 
Either way, I'm going to figure it out. As a 
dancer, my craft demands it."
