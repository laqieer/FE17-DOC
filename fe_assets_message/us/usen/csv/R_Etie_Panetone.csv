[Etie] 
Hey there, Panette. Sorry for ambushing you 
the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Panette] 
I must say, you gave me quite a fright."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Etie] 
I didn't do it to be mean."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Etie] 
I just wanted to get past that front you put up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Etie] 
And the reason I did it is because...in a sense, 
I'm the same way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Panette] 
You mean...you are of common birth as well?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Panette] 
You were a wild, vulgar runaway who picked 
fights with anyone who crossed her path?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Etie] 
Not all of THAT, but... Here. Go ahead and 
feel my abs."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Panette] 
If you insist..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Panette] 
Good gracious me!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Panette] 
These are muscles?! It feels as if you are 
smuggling bullion in here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Etie] 
Yeah. I work out. You know any other 
noblewomen with abs like these?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Panette] 
I suspect there's nary a one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Etie] 
I might look like a lady, but deep down, I'll 
never be one. You've heard that too, I bet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Panette] 
Yes, indeed I have."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Etie] 
I knew it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Etie] 
I thought I was the only one in the world with 
this problem, but now there's two of us."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Etie] 
Maybe we can help each other out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Panette] 
I would like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Panette] 
Haha, though its start was somewhat unusual, 
I think this will be a wonderful friendship."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Panette] 
Etie and Panette, the rampaging redheads! 
Heaven help any fool who crosses us!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Etie] 
I got you a gift! Since we're gonna be friends 
and all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Panette] 
My, what gorgeous flowers!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Etie] 
They grow in my hometown. They're associated 
with eccentric ladies and true connections."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Etie] 
Seem fitting to mark the start of a friendship 
between two tough gals like us."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Panette] 
It is as though this breed of flower was made 
just for us. How very touching."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Etie] 
I think we'll have a lot to learn from each other. 
Don't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Panette] 
Certainly! To start, perhaps you can tell me how 
you managed that sneak attack."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Etie] 
Sorry in advance, Panette..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Etie] 
HYYYAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Panette] 
What the?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Panette] 
Who's there?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Panette] 
Whoever it is, you got three seconds to show 
yourself before I crack your skull!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Panette] 
Three... Two... One..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Etie] 
Cool it, will you?! It's me!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Panette] 
Huh?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Panette] 
Etie? What the heck are you doing here?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Panette] 
I mean... Etie! Heh, how very unexpected!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Etie] 
Heh heh, got you, Panette. You went and 
showed your true colors."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Panette] 
Whatever do you mean? I was merely, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Etie] 
Don't bother denying it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Etie] 
All that hoity-toity stuff is just for show. 
Right then? That was the real you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Etie] 
This noblewoman act is completely phony."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Panette] 
No! I already told you, that is simply not true!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Etie] 
What are you so upset about? I didn't mean it 
in a bad way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Panette] 
How else could you possibly mean it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Etie] 
I've got to run, but I'll explain some other time. 
Take care."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Panette] 
Um, all right. Farewell, then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Etie] 
Hey, Panette. How's it going?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Panette] 
Quite well, thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Panette] 
You appear to be in good health yourself, Etie."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Etie] 
Yep. Good eye."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Etie] 
Hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Etie] 
Hmm... Hmph."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Panette] 
Hm... Is something the matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Etie] 
Oh, sorry. I'm being rude."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Etie] 
Ahem."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Etie] 
Panette, your stylish fashion sense and refined 
speech are peerless."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Panette] 
Why, thank you. That is most kind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Etie] 
There's just one problem."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Panette] 
Oh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Etie] 
You're hiding something."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Panette] 
Whatever do you mean? I assure you, I am not."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Etie] 
You carry yourself like a noblewoman, but... 
you are not one. I smell a fake."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Panette] 
Why, that is...ludicrous! Slanderous, even!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Etie] 
So you won't admit it. Fine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Etie] 
If being blunt won't work, I'll have to 
get sneaky."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Etie] 
See you around, Panette."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Panette] 
Good gracious. Where did that come from?"
