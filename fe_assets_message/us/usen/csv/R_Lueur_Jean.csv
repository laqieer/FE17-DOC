[Jean] 2 

[Alear] 
I have something for you, Jean."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Jean] 
Medicinal herbs? Oh! This is quite a lot."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
I found a place full of them in the forest, so I 
picked as many as I could."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jean] 
Wow...thank you so much. This is going to make 
a big difference back home."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
What you said about your parents really struck 
me. I want to help your family as much as I can."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jean] 
Thanks, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jean] 
Hey, what happened to your arm? It's all 
scratched up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
Oh, right after I found the patch of herbs, 
I slipped and tumbled down a hill."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jean] 
Oh no! Here, sit down, and I'll treat it right now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
It doesn't really bother me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Jean] 
Please, Divine One. I'd hate for your wounds to 
stay open and get infected."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
All right. Go ahead, then."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jean] 
Let's see here..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Jean] 
You know, Divine One, I think it was good that 
I left the island to travel with you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
Yeah?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jean] 
You're a very generous person, but you don't 
know how to be generous to yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Jean] 
As long as I'm around, no matter how little care 
you have for your well-being, you'll be fine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jean] 
I want to pay you back a hundred times over 
for all the kindness you've shown me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
Wow."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Jean] 
There. All treated. It should heal quickly now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
Thanks! And I'm glad to have you along too."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Jean] 2 

[Alear] 
Picking herbs again today, I see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Jean] 
This one really makes a difference in treating 
all kinds of illnesses and injuries back home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Jean] 
I used to go out all the time with my father 
to harvest these."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
I didn't get to talk much with your father on 
the island. What's he like?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jean] 
Whenever I succeed, in studies or in helping out, 
he praises me like a well-behaved puppy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Jean] 
But when I mess up, he gets very upset, like 
he's scolding a misbehaving puppy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
So you're a puppy either way, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Jean] 
Haha, now that you mention it..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Jean] 
He was the kind of dad where some days we 
got along, and some days I hated him."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Jean] 
But in his absence, I appreciate him more. 
Same with my mother."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jean] 
I didn't realize it when I saw them every day, 
but I have a lot of respect for my parents."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Jean] 
I think the only reason I work so hard now is 
because of the way they raised me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
Jean...that's so beautiful..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jean] 
Huh?! Are you crying?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
That story about your family was just... 
very touching."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Jean] 
Thank you, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jean] 
Here, take this poultice. It's good for swelling 
around the eyes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
Haha, thanks, Jean. I needed that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Jean] 2 

[Alear] 
Jean? Are you not getting enough greens 
at the café?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jean] 
Oh, no, I'm actually picking medicinal 
herbs. See?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
Wow, you've got a ton picked already."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Jean] 
This one acts as a painkiller, and this one is 
useful in several ointments."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Jean] 
It used to grow all over my home island, but it's 
gotten harder to find lately."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jean] 
So I'm picking some here to send back to 
my father."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
For the clinic on your island, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
This is a lot for one person to harvest alone. 
Let me help you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Jean] 
No, no, no, that's OK! You must have a lot of 
other important things to do, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
Not so many that I can't lend a hand here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
Besides, with the war and your studies, I bet 
you're so busy, you barely have time to sleep."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Jean] 
Hm-hm, I should've known the Divine One 
would see right through me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
That's right. Nothing gets by me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Jean] 
If you really wouldn't mind, then yes, it would 
be a big help. Thank you!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Jean] 2 

[Alear] 
We pulled up a pretty big haul today."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Jean] 
Mostly thanks to you. You're not tired from 
working so hard?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
Having you along made it fun. I feel like I could 
keep going for hours."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Jean] 
Uh-oh. Looks like you're hurt again."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
Huh? Oh, no. That's from the last battle. 
I stepped in to protect an ally."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
I had it healed right afterward, but I guess it still 
left a mark."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Jean] 
You should try this. It's an ointment I made 
from the herbs we picked last time."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Jean] 
If you smear it on, it should keep the redness 
down. You'll have to wait a bit for it to dry."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Jean] 
If you're ever hurt...or even just in trouble, 
I hope you know you can count on me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Jean] 
I want you to be able to count on me the way 
so many others are counting on you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
But, Jean, don't you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
I already do."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Jean] 
You─ You do?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
Of everyone in the army, you're somebody 
I know I can always rely on."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
In fact, I've been thinking you deserve to have 
this Pact Ring I've been carrying."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Jean] 
I don't know... Something that precious should 
go to someone worthier."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
I can't think of anyone worthier than you. 
You've always been there for me, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Jean] 
Well... I guess that makes sense."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Jean] 
Thank you. From now on, you can consider 
me your personal physician!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
I wouldn't have it any other way."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Jean] 
But if that's how it's going to be, I've got a lot 
of reading and practice to get to."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Jean] 
The Divine One's personal physician had better 
not make any mistakes!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Take your time. Once this war is over, I should 
have a lot fewer injuries to patch up."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Jean] 
True. Um, ..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Jean] 
Thanks for believing in me. I'll work hard to 
become a doctor worthy of treating you."
