[Jean] 
So...I wrote a letter to my mother after we 
last spoke."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Jean] 
I was thinking of sending it today, but I was 
hoping to run it by you first."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
Certainly. No *trouble* at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jean] 
Thank you. OK, here goes..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Jean] 
""Dear Mother. Happy birthday! I hope the day 
finds you well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jean] 
""Things are fine here. I did meet quite a... 
mysterious fellow recently."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Zelkov] 
What? Who is this *mysterious* person?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Jean] 
""The first time he talked to me, my knees began 
to shake as soon as he said, 'Come here.'"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jean] 
""He smiled thinly as he approached, talking 
about how he didn't want to scare me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Jean] 
""'Well,' I thought, 'it's been a good life.'"""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Oh. You are talking about *me.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jean] 
""But then I found out he's actually a very 
kind man."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Zelkov] 
Ah..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Jean] 
""He's the whole reason I'm writing this letter 
to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Jean] 
""You always said, 'Don't judge a person before 
getting to know them,' and you were right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jean] 
""Now that I'm living far from you, I realize how 
right you were about a lot of things."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Jean] 
""I'm glad you're my mother. I hope you stay 
healthy for a long, long time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jean] 
""I'll be home for your birthday next year. 
I promise. Give my love to Father."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jean] 
""Your son, Jean."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Jean] 
And that's all. Not too weird for a birthday 
letter, is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Zelkov] 
Of course not. I think it is absolutely *fitting.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Zelkov] 
I am surprised to be a *subject* in it, but I 
cannot say that I mind leaving an impression."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Zelkov] 
Please, send this along to her as well. I call it 
the...*obsidian oil.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Jean] 
Obsidian this time?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Zelkov] 
It is absorbed through the skin. It should 
soothe your mother's *ailing* hips."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Jean] 
Thank you, Zelkov. For this, and for everything 
else you gave me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Zelkov] 
You can thank me by taking good care of her."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Zelkov] 
I never had the opportunity to show my parents 
gratitude. I regret that every single day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Zelkov] 
Do not make the same mistake I did. Let them 
see how much you care while they are still here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Jean] 
I will, Zelkov. I'll be a good son for both of us."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Zelkov] 
I appreciate it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Jean] 
And more than that, I'll be a good friend for 
you too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Jean] 
I hope you'll come find me the next time you're 
making medicine!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Zelkov] 
That...means a great deal to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Zelkov] 
I mean to say, I will *gladly* accept your offer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Zelkov] 
Thank you, Jean."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Jean] 2 
[Jean] 
Thanks again for the medicine. It's helped a lot 
of people! They were all really grateful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Zelkov] 
I am pleased to hear that. My mother *deserves* 
the gratitude, since these were her recipes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Jean] 
Where is your mother? I'd like to thank 
her personally."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Zelkov] 
That is not possible, I'm afraid. She has been 
*deceased* for more than a decade."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jean] 
Oh, I didn't realize. I'm sorry to bring it up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Zelkov] 
Do not trouble yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Zelkov] 
To care for a wretch like me took kindness 
above and beyond the usual standard."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Zelkov] 
The light of her love had the power to cut 
through my darkest day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Jean] 
Mm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Zelkov] 
What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jean] 
What you said reminds me of my own mother."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Jean] 
She's a lot like yours. She always doted on me 
and made sure I knew I was loved."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Zelkov] 
Have you *lost* a mother as well?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jean] 
Oh, no, she's still alive. Her hips are troubling 
her these days, though."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Jean] 
I haven't been able to see her lately..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Zelkov] 
It must be difficult to be *away* from her."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jean] 
Uh-huh. It's her birthday soon, and I don't know 
what I'll do this year."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Jean] 
We always celebrate birthdays together, but this 
time it looks like we'll be apart."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Zelkov] 
Perhaps you could write her a *letter*?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Jean] 
Huh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Jean] 
Wonderful idea! Why didn't it occur to me? 
Thank you, Zelkov."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Zelkov] 
No thanks needed. To see a child happy is 
sufficient *recompense* for me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Jean] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Hello, Jean. You are an aspiring *doctor,* yes? 
Would you come here a moment?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jean] 
Huh? Yes, I'm studying to be a doctor. Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Zelkov] 
You seem uneasy. Have I *startled* you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Zelkov] 
If so, please accept my apology. The last thing 
I would ever wish to do is *impart* fear."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Zelkov] 
Shall I try starting over and greeting you again? 
Would it *help* if I sat down?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jean] 
Um, no. That's OK."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Zelkov] 
Very well. Then please come *here* a moment. 
I would like to get your opinion."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jean] 
My opinion on what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Zelkov] 
These *medicines* I've made."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Zelkov] 
Look here. I call this one the *azure elixir.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jean] 
Azure elixir? What does it do?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Zelkov] 
It settles painful pounding within the skull. 
Provides the *tranquility* of an azure sky."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Jean] 
Oh... So it's a headache remedy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Zelkov] 
Indeed. And this is the *crimson tincture.* 
Apply it to end the red fury of damaged skin."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Jean] 
In other words, an ointment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jean] 
Azure elixir and crimson tincture, huh? That all 
sounds kind of...pretentious."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Zelkov] 
What was that? I did not *hear* you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Jean] 
Nothing. Just talking to myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Jean] 
These are amazing, though. You did good work 
here. You must be a skilled doctor."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Zelkov] 
I *learned* the techniques from my mother, 
who was a trained physician."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Zelkov] 
In any case, if these are *satisfactory,* then 
I would like to leave them with you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Jean] 
Thank you very much for the medicine, Zelkov. 
You're an unexpectedly good person."
