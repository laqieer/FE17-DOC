My dream has always been to become a doctor

But with monsters running rampant, I might die 
before I can do that. Look what just happened!"

At the Divine Dragon's side, I think I can learn 
to fight and to heal people at the same time."

That's all very well for you, but what about 
the Divine Dragon? You'd just be a burden."

Oh, I wouldn't say that. Not if what he did 
during that battle is anything to go by."

understand why you'd be worried."

ask that you take good care of my boy."

about me. It's not like I'm never coming home."

doctor. You'll see!"

I will! Thank you, both of you. I can't wait to 
start working alongside the Divine Dragon!"
