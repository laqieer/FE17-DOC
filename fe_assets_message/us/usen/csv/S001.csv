What brings such a splendid personage to 
our humble village?"

I've been on a journey to defeat the Fell Dragon

you, Divine One, can I come along and help?!"

MID_ED4_#013,"[Jean] 
My dream has always been to become a doctor 
so I can save people. And that hasn't changed."
MID_ED4_#014,"[Jean] 
But with monsters running rampant, I might die 
before I can do that. Look what just happened!"
MID_ED4_#015,"[Jean] 
At the Divine Dragon's side, I think I can learn 
to fight and to heal people at the same time."
MID_ED4_#016,"[Jean] 父親 
That's all very well for you, but what about 
the Divine Dragon? You'd just be a burden."
MID_ED4_#017,"[Alear] 
Oh, I wouldn't say that. Not if what he did 
during that battle is anything to go by."

If Jean wants to come, I don't mind. Though I 
understand why you'd be worried."

Well, if he has your permission, then... I can only 
ask that you take good care of my boy."

What? You're actually allowing him to go?"
MID_ED4_#021,"[Jean] 
Father, I told you, you don't need to worry 
about me. It's not like I'm never coming home."
MID_ED4_#022,"In fact, when I do return, I'll be a first-rate 
doctor. You'll see!"
MID_ED4_#023,"[Jean] 父親 
How quickly they grow up..."

Of course, Jean. Be a good boy, a hard worker, 
and an attentive student. And come home safe."

I will! Thank you, both of you. I can't wait to 
start working alongside the Divine Dragon!"

I'll be leaning on you a lot in the days to come."
