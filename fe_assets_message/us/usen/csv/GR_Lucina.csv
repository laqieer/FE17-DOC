MID_GR_Alfred_A_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Alfred] 
You knew the Firene royals 1,000 years ago. 
Were my ancestors...strong?"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
They were strong indeed. But at that time... 
their strength could not save them."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
I will not allow that outcome a second time. 
You are all under my protection."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Alfred] 
I won't make you go through that a second time 
either. We'll stay standing to the bitter end!"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Alfred] 
If you were Firene's ring 1,000 years ago, how 
come you were moved to a different country?"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
Lumera wished it so. Her intent is unknown to 
me. Still, she foresaw some reason for a change."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
You are the prince of Firene, yes? My ring was 
held by your nation 1,000 years ago."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Alfred] 
Really?! You were in Firene back then? Huh. 
Well, I'm sure glad to have you back."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
My goodness! These shirts! They have your 
face on them! That is INCREDIBLE!"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Anna] 
You think so? The way they turned out, I was 
on the fence about whether to sell them at all."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
You have to sell them! I'd buy 10!"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Anna] 
Well, if you like 'em, that settles it! I'll print up 
hundreds and make a killing!"
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
It's inspiring how you manage to stay cheerful 
despite being separated from your family."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Anna] 
Oh, I'm way too mature to let a little thing like 
that get me down."
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Anna] 
Big sale on again today! Bring your wallets and 
purses, everyone!"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Anna? You traveled to this world too?"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
After observing your knife skills, my sword 
skills have gotten a fair bit sharper, Bunet."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
I'm pleased to hear that, especially since the 
dish I've been working on was inspired by you."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
My aim is to make it just as enjoyable to gaze 
upon at as it is to taste."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
I'm so happy I was able to inspire you. I look 
forward to enjoying this feast for the eyes."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Bunet] 
Do you enjoy watching me prepare 
food, Lucina?"
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I do. I've learned a lot from watching how you 
wield your chef's knife, Bunet."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Bunet] 
Lucina, the legendary sword you wield... 
I wonder, what does it taste like?"
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Falchion is not an ingredient in a recipe! But... 
now that you ask, I can't help but wonder too."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Boucheron] 
So even Emblems work out. But do you really 
need to do it all the time?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
I must always strive for more. My body must be 
perfectly honed if I'm to save the world."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Doing too much will wear you down, not build 
you up. Hm, how about we take a book break?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
If that is what you advise, then very well. Would 
you read to me from one of your favorites?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
It never occurred to me that reading and fishing 
could result in the perfect body."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Those are just my hobbies. The muscle comes 
naturally for someone with my constitution."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Tell me, what does one do all day to attain 
musculature like yours?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Well, if you're me, you read and fish. Is that the 
answer you were looking for?"
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Céline] 
What do you think we ought to do to achieve 
true peace, Lucina?"
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
Explore peaceful ways of solving problems, to 
begin with. Violence should be a last resort."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
I'm only one person, but I'll wield my sword 
when necessary to protect my loved ones."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Céline] 
On that score, we are of one mind. Let us keep 
working toward peace, however we must."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Céline] 
The more I hear of the ruined world of Ylisse, 
the more I realize how sheltered I've been."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I disagree. You fight as hard as anyone. Firene 
will never meet the same fate as my home."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Céline] 
Good day, Lucina. Thank you for your help in 
battle earlier. Have you time to chat today?"
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Of course. Knowing one's allies can be useful 
in combat. So tell me all about yourself."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
The presence of so many different foods proves 
that this world hasn't yielded to despair."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Chloé] 
I agree! Still, more and more of those stalls 
close down every day."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
We'll put a stop to that. Let us return light to 
this world, so that they may reopen once more."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Chloé] 
And so all the best foods are back on the menu, 
right? That's something worth fighting for!"
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
I don't recognize any of the foods you eat, 
Chloé. Are they common in your world?"
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
The stuff I just bought is folk food, which is a 
little off the beaten path. I love it, though!"
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Chloé] 
Hey, Lucina. If you have time, do you want to 
come to the market with me?"
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
That sounds delightful. I'm so very interested in 
seeing the settlements of this world."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I know what I need to do, but I can't get my 
body to obey. I may be weak forever..."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
You won't become strong overnight...but you 
are stronger today than you were yesterday."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
Don't give up, Citrinne. You'll keep growing, bit 
by bit, day by day, until you reach your goals."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
My goals feel so far away...but you're right. 
I will soldier on, Lucina─with you as my guide!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Lucina, would you mind if I watched you train? 
I'd love to learn from you, if that's possible."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I wouldn't mind at all. If my efforts can help 
you grow, then observe as much as you like."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Citrinne] 
You're really strong, aren't you, Lucina? I must 
admit, I'm actually quite envious of you."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
There's no need for envy, Citrinne. Anyone can 
grow stronger with the right kind of training."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Clanne] 
I've been thinking about family trees and how, 
even after I'm gone, my line will go on and on."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
The stewards will too. You'll be part of their 
history, and they'll strive to be as heroic as you."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
Much as I tried to become someone King Marth 
would be proud of."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
You've inspired me, Lady Lucina. I'm going to 
show all the future stewards how to be a hero."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Clanne] 
I'm like you and Lord Marth! Us ""Stewards of 
the Dragon"" serve generation after generation."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
That means your ancestors must have fought 
beside the Divine Dragon a thousand years ago."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Clanne] 
Is it true you're Lord Marth's blood relative? 
I didn't know Emblems could be related."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Yes, I am his descendant. So I try to show that 
I'm worthy of that lineage."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Diamant] 
If Brodia's remaining forces fall, the kingdom 
could be destroyed. I can't bear that thought."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
I know how hard it is to leave soldiers behind. 
For their sake, we must claim a swift victory."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
Brodia will not fall into ruin, Diamant. Never will 
you suffer the same anguish that I did."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Diamant] 
Thank you, Lucina. That's reassuring. You may 
never claim a throne...but you are a great leader."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Diamant] 
It's incredible that you managed to keep fighting 
as your country fell to ruin. I'm not sure I could."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I've seen how fierce you can become, Diamant. 
I know you would fight bravely till the very end."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Diamant] 
You were a destined monarch like me, Lucina. 
I'd love to hear your perspective on ruling."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Of course. I've never actually ruled a kingdom, 
but I would be happy to compare philosophies."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Etie] 
Hey, Lucina. Is there anything you wish you 
could do once this war is over?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
Hmm. Before I sleep in the ring once more, 
I'd like to visit someplace I've never seen."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
I'd also like to see as many flowers as possible. 
I like them. They represent peace to me."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Etie] 
Then I'll show you around my hometown! If you 
like flowers, you're gonna love it there."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Etie] 
It sounds like you lived through some pretty 
hard times. Is that how you got so toned?"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I hadn't thought too much about it, but that's 
certainly possible."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Etie] 
You're staring pretty hard at that flower. 
What's up?"
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
They very rarely bloomed in the world I grew 
up in. This is a novel sight to me."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Fogado] 
I see you're finally starting to relax, Lucina. 
It's a good look on you."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
I am? I wasn't aware that my behavior 
had changed."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
Yeah, you were pretty guarded at first. But now, 
that charming side of yours is starting to show."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
I have you to thank for that. Your friendship has 
helped me feel like I can truly be myself."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Fogado] 
We still haven't thrown a proper welcome party 
for you, have we? We've gotta get on that."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
That's very nice of you, Fogado. I would love to 
take part in such a joyous social gathering."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
So, you're not just a prince─you lead a militia 
too. My father did as well, you know."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Fogado] 
Your pops led a group like my Sentinels? What a 
great guy! I'd love to throw a party for him."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Framme] 
I really, really wish I could be more like you, 
Lady Lucina. You're so mature and in control."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
Not really. I've been in trouble a few times after 
accidentally breaking things while training."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
And, Framme, your enthusiasm is part of your 
charm. I hope that never changes."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Framme] 
I'm really glad to hear that, Lady Lucina. If you 
like that I'm peppy, then peppy I'll always be!"
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Framme] 
Every time I try to help out, I get so energized 
I mess things up. It's super frustrating."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
Don't worry, we all make mistakes. What 
matters most is that you don't get hurt."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Framme] 
Lady Lucina! Please, let me help you out. 
Chores, errands─leave 'em all to m─ AAH!"
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Framme?! Are you all right? You got so excited 
you fell right over!"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
I've been watching you as we fight together. 
I think you've been developing some panache."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Goldmary] 
You think so? I'm so glad. Actually, I've noticed 
lately that you can be quite elegant, yourself."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Perhaps you and I have been rubbing off on 
each other. We do make a fine team."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
Haha, we do. Everyone, I'm very sorry if 
Goldmary and I are too much for you to handle."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I may be adorable, but you clearly have 
something that I don't. A kind of panache."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
Do I? Well, to be frank, sometimes I wish I had 
your superb elegance."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Goldmary] 
However charming I may be, Lucina, I still find 
myself getting nervous around you."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
I don't see why, but I'm sure you'll move past it 
as we get to know each other."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
You seem out of sorts, Hortensia. What's on 
your mind?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Hortensia] 
I want to be friends with you, but I don't know 
how. Can you just tell me what I have to do?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
Have we not been friends all this time? That 
would be news to me."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Really? Oh, that's such a relief. Why didn't you 
say so sooner?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Hortensia] 
There must be something I can do for you. 
Whatever it is, just name it."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I'm fine. I have all I need. But if you are worried, 
I sincerely hope you'll tell me."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Hortensia] 
I'm sorry for using your ring to fight for the 
wrong side, Lucina. Can I make it up to you?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
No need for that. As far as I'm concerned, 
you've done more than enough already."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Ivy] 
I felt prepared for it at the time, but the loss 
of my father has been a stubborn wound."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
I know the feeling all too well. If you want to 
talk about it, please know I'm here."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
Thank you. Would you mind telling me of your 
father? It might help to hear your experience."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
I don't think I'm over the loss either─even now. 
But if it's useful, I'll gladly tell you everything."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
My friend had a wyvern like yours─she had a 
very special name. He loved her dearly."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Ivy] 
I never thought to give mine a name. Do you 
have any suggestions?"
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Thanks to you, I can continue to serve the 
Divine Dragon. I want you to know I'm grateful."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Ivy] 
I did not do it for thanks. I did it because 
it was right."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Jade] 
Have you finished the rest of my novel, Lucina? 
I'm curious...which parts made you laugh?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
Oh, I laughed at so many parts! There was that 
one scene, and that other one...and the ending!"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Jade] 
You laughed at the ending? Really? This is... 
valuable feedback. I may run some edits by you."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
Yes, please! You're a fantastic writer, Jade. 
I'll be looking forward to more!"
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Your novel was so funny, Jade! When the main 
character had to leave home...I was in stitches!"
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Jade] 
That was supposed to be an emotional moment. 
You must have a, uh, unique sense of humor."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
I've heard you write very funny novels, Jade. 
May I read some of them?"
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Jade] 
Of course, Lucina. I'm not sure they'll be your 
kind of humor...but I hope you enjoy them."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Jean] 
I'm so tired. I can't even lift a finger anymore."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
You did outstanding today, Jean. But don't 
work yourself to the bone."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
I understand wanting to save as many as you 
can, but if we lose you, all that stops."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Jean] 
You're right. I'll be careful not to let myself end 
up as the next one in a sickbed."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
You really outdid yourself in the battle today. 
Your presence was invaluable."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Jean] 
Aw, Lucina, you'll make me blush. But I did 
feel like I was contributing a little more."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Jean] 
Thanks for pulling me out of hot water earlier!"
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
It worked out that way this time, that's all. 
Next time, I might rely on you to save me."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
What drives you to grow stronger, Kagetsu?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
It is very simple. If I am to climb this mountain 
we call life, I wish to see it from its peak."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
A noble goal. That simple determination might 
be the key to your success."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
And you, my friend and rival, are one step along 
my path to greatness! Prepare to be surpassed!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
All your training has paid off, Kagetsu. You were 
spectacular in that last battle."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
I am glad to hear you say so─and even more 
glad we are such good friends!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Your skill is just what I would expect of an 
Emblem. Will you face me in mock combat?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
I've been admiring your swordplay as well. 
I'd be delighted to spar with you."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lapis] 
Lucina, you came from a harsh world, right? 
I was wondering...what did you eat to survive?"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
We had rationed food, so we ate that for a time. 
Hunting was also an option. We even ate bears."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
Really?! I do that too! Sometimes I─ Oh, wait. 
Sorry. That must have been hard. I... I didn't..."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
It's OK, Lapis. I'm happy something like that can 
bring us closer together. Tell me more."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lapis] 
I grow so attached to things I make by hand... 
but that just means I'm more careful with 'em."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
Hmm... A friend I once knew told me that giving 
tools their own names can have a similar effect."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Why are you carrying so many tools, Lapis? 
Are you on your way to fix something?"
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
I'm patching a wall. Someone knocked a huge 
hole into it. Who could have been so careless?!"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Lindon] 
How were you able to withstand living in such 
a desperate, hopeless world, Lucina?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
In all honesty, even with my stubbornness and 
pride, I'd have succumbed without my allies."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
So that's where you drew your strength from. 
Tighter bonds may be what this world needs."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
Then it's time we forged them for ourselves. 
Once we have that, nothing is impossible."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Lindon] 
Would you tell me more about your world 
today, Lucina?"
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
Your curiosity seems endless, Lindon. I hope 
some of it rubs off on me."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
That's a delicious-looking dessert. Did you 
make it, Lindon?"
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Lindon] 
It was one of my experiments, yes. But don't 
worry─the taste is world-class."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Louis, what are you getting at with all these 
questions you've been asking?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Louis] 
Must I be ""getting at"" anything? I have a natural 
curiosity about the way people socialize."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
So you like people-watching. I see. But why the 
intense interest in me particularly?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Louis] 
Why would I not be? Your circumstances are so 
unique that I find myself utterly captivated."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Louis] 
Indulge me...would you rather treat someone as 
a big sister or be treated as such?"
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I'd feel a bit uncomfortable being treated that 
way. But it would be nice to have a sister figure."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Louis] 
You seem to be well-liked by all, Lucina. I think 
that's simply splendid."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Uh...is that unusual? I'm sure I have the normal 
amount of friends. No more than anyone else."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Long ago, I was driven from my home. But I'd 
have died if I stayed. All would have been lost."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Alear] 
I see what you mean. Sometimes you have to 
withdraw... But did you win in the end?"
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
Yes. I made a new future, and you can too. 
So never give up until your last breath."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Understood. Then no matter how hard things 
get, I'll believe that they'll turn out for the best."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Alear] 
I worry sometimes if we're really capable of 
winning this war."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I know things can seem bleak. But as long as 
you hold out hope, you can drive the dark away."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Alear] 
Thank you for the hope you showed me back 
then. If not for you, I might have given up."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
I only gave you a small push. You'll be carving 
your own future for yourself."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Who I was, what I did... I do not regret those 
actions so much as the actions I did not take."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Were I more diligent in my efforts as friend and 
protector, might Lady Veyle have been happier?"
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
The past is out of reach for most. Yet the future 
can be changed for any of us. You included."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
I'm happy to help. From now on, let's ask 
ourselves what would bring Veyle happiness."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Your presence has caused Lady Veyle to smile 
more. Thank you."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
There's no reason to thank me. Veyle's smile is 
your doing, Mauvier."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Mauvier] 
I do not require your concern. Lady Veyle needs 
you more."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
I'm keeping an eye on Veyle, but my worries are 
equal for you, Mauvier."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Merrin] 
The more we fight beside each other, the more 
I see how cool you are. I─ I want to be like you!"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
Oh, if you only knew how I see you. You carry 
yourself with such confidence. I truly envy that."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
You do?! What a nice thing to say. I guess we've 
got a mutual-admiration thing going on here."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
I guess we do. I hope we consider each other 
not just allies but friends, now and forever."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Merrin] 
Your fight style is so cool. It makes me want to 
come up with an epic new move of my own."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I'm not sure you need a new move, but if you 
do, you should call it the ""Swordy Poke-Poke""!"
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Merrin] 
Lady Lucina, I understand you used to fight 
wearing a mask. I might try wearing one myself."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
I only wore one to hide my identity. But I do 
think a mask would look dashing on you, Merrin."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Does the royal family of Solm have other unique 
characteristics beyond the sparkling eyes?"
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
No, we're pretty normal, really. In fact, not 
everyone in our family even gets the cool eyes."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
Well, with or without a royal mark, being part 
of a ruling family can be a burden to bear."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
True, but I like our eyes and what they stand 
for. And, hey, we can bear any burden together."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Timerra] 
I got my eyes from my mother. It's a sign that I 
have what it takes to be queen of Solm one day."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
The Brand in my eye runs in my family as well. 
I'm so pleased our royal families share this."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Timerra] 
I couldn't help but notice your left eye, Lucina. 
That design is so mysterious and super pretty."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
And your eyes have such a majestic shimmer. 
Is that a trait that runs in the royal family?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
You've had to leave your church unattended for 
a long time now. Does that worry you?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Pandreo] 
I don't have a choice, Lucina. I have to focus on 
this fight. If the world dies, faith dies with it."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
I see. In my world, near the end, shows of faith 
were rare. And for some, were abandoned."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Please, let me say a prayer for your world. 
May the souls that were lost find peace at last."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
What a unique training regimen you have. 
The violent jumping and odd lurching moves..."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, I was actually...dancing. But since you were 
so impressed, let's just call it training, OK?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
You know, Pandreo, I happen to be friends with 
another rather un-priest-like priest."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Pandreo] 
You're friends with an unusual priest like me? 
No way! You've got to tell me all about him."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Panette, please, you must teach me how to 
conquer my fear of bugs. It's so embarrassing."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Panette] 
There's nothing to be embarrassed about. 
Revealing a bit of weakness can be charming."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Panette] 
Should a bug appear again, I will simply take 
care of it for you. That way you can rest easy."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
Thank you, Panette. That is reassuring. Next 
time I see a bug, I'm hiding behind you."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Eeeek! It's a giant bug! I─ I don't know what 
to do!"
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Panette] 
Oh now, calm yourself, Lucina. I shall drive it 
away for you."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Panette, I must apologize for earlier. It was silly 
of me to scream so loudly at the sight of a bug."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Panette] 
Not to worry. No doubt you were weary from 
battle. Besides, it was cute to see you flustered."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Rosado] 
You're interested in being cute, right, Lucina?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
I have never given it too much thought, but I 
don't see why I would reject the notion."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
Great! I'm always striving to be the cutest, so 
let's put our heads together. We can trade tips!"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
Sounds like a fine idea to me."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Rosado] 
I hate war. Everyone's so caught up in fighting 
that they don't even care about what's cute."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
All the more reason to win peace as quickly 
as we can."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Your wyvern's adorable, Rosado. You know 
what would really top off her look?"
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Rosado] 
Please, stop suggesting the bear hat."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Saphir] 
Let's cancel that bout we spoke of, Lucina. 
I've changed my mind."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
Fine by me. May I ask why?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
You obviously take no pleasure in battle. 
It was selfish of me to ask."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
I appreciate that, Saphir. Here's an idea─how 
about you take me fishing instead?"
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Saphir] 
You're one of the best fighters I've ever seen. 
I'd love to go toe-to-toe with you someday."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
Once we're done with all the real fighting, 
I'll indulge you in a proper bout."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Saphir] 
Wouldn't know it to look at you, Lucina, but you 
fight with the intensity of a hardened veteran."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Indeed. I've seen more harrowing battles than 
I care to think about."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Seadall] 
There's something I have to say to you, Lucina. 
And that is, thank you."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
I'm not sure what I've done to earn such 
heartfelt gratitude, Seadall."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
Telling me that my dancing gives you courage... 
It meant so much to me. It's all I ever hope for."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
I told you the truth, Seadall. Your dance has the 
power to fill anyone from any world with hope."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Seadall] 
As someone new to our world's art and culture, 
I wonder, what do you think of my dancing?"
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I don't know much about dance, but I do know 
that when you perform, I am filled with courage."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Seadall] 
I couldn't help but notice the look on your face 
while you watched me dance."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Your dance looks so incredibly different from 
dances in my world. It was entrancing to watch."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Alcryst] 
There are so many wonderful people among our 
ranks. I have no right to stand beside all of you."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
That's not true, Alcryst. I'd be struggling if it 
weren't for you."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
I still have so much to learn, so much growing 
to do. I hope you'll keep fighting by my side."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
That seems impossible... But if you truly need 
my help, I'll lend you every bit of my strength."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
I was trained by my own father, just like you, 
Alcryst. Seems we have that in common!"
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
I'm not worthy of such a favorable comparison, 
but I would like to hear more about your father."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Your fighting style is a wonder to behold, 
Alcryst. Where did you learn your technique?"
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Well, my father forced a strict training regimen 
onto me as a child. It's...not a fun story."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Amber] 
Hey, Lucina! I'm heading out to find a legendary 
weapon. Wanna come?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
A legendary weapon?! If we had something like 
that, we could turn the tide of this terrible war."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
I imagine the quest ahead will be most 
challenging. What's your plan?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Amber] 
Well, I know hundreds of legends. If we look for 
all of them, we're sure to find one that's real!"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Amber] 
Hey, Lucina! Get a load of these new clothes! 
Isn't this the best getup ever?"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
The alpaca cross-stitched into the center is so 
large... I love it! Your fashion is truly inspiring!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
I was told that you're a celebrated hero, Amber. 
May I hear about some of your adventures?"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Amber] 
Sure! I'll tell you my favorite legends...right after 
I get through my coolest alpaca stories."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
Watching you knit, I am reminded of my mother 
knitting when I was little."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
Oh? She must have been a spectacular woman. 
By the by, the sweater you asked for..."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Vander] 
The one adorned with my visage? It is finished. 
Who shall I give it to?"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
Oh, splendid! I imagine the Divine Dragon will 
love it. I can't think of a better gift!"
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
With knitting, you can make sweaters. Like, say, 
one with a big picture of your face."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Vander] 
I... I mean... Yes. But I am not so sure who 
would willingly wear such a garment."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Lucina] 
I've heard you're a knitting expert. I'm terrible 
with any delicate work, so consider me envious."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Vander] 
Heh. Most are surprised that a man as large as I 
is capable of something so...delicate."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Veyle] 
Lucina, what was your father like?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
He was strong, wise, and fair. More than 
anything, he treasured his bond with his allies."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
He sounds so...good. My Papa was always 
alone, always staring at some far-off place..."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
He may not have been there for you, Veyle, but 
I am here and I will always support you. I swear."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Veyle] 
I know Papa is doing awful things. Still, I just 
can't bring myself to hate him completely."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I understand, Veyle. The father-child bond is so 
powerful. Do not worry, we'll stop him together."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Veyle] 
Didn't a Fell Dragon ravage your world? You 
must hate it when I'm around."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Not at all. You look different. You act different. 
You are your own dragon, Veyle."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Pointy Demonspanker? Was Falchion really 
called that?!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
Yes─by me. A friend of mine repaired the 
weapon, and in his honor I gave it a new name."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Lucina] 
He was less impressed than I'd imagined he 
would be. I ended up changing it back."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
Makes for a great story, though. Now I wanna 
give my own weapons fancy names!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Yunaka] 
I can't get over what a privilege it is just to lay 
eyes on a legendary weapon like Falchion."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
Would you believe me if I told you its name 
actually used to be Pointy Demonspanker?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Lucina] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Your sword looks an awful lot like Marth's, 
Lucina. Is it actually the same blade?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
Good eye. The guard and pommel have been 
replaced, but it's otherwise the same sword."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Zelkov] 
I see it now. You are the type to ignore your 
*own* pain for the benefit of friends and allies."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Lucina] 
I don't think of it in those terms. I just want 
to be useful to the people I care about."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
It was intended as a *compliment.* The way you 
live is impossible for me, so I find it impressive."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Lucina] 
It's not impossible at all, Zelkov. You're fighting 
for a better world the same way I am."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Zelkov] 
It must be *difficult* for you to fight boredom 
without the ability to handle corporeal objects."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Lucina] 
I wouldn't say that. Listening to people talk 
offers me a good deal of entertainment."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Lucina] 2 

[Zelkov] 
It seems we share a certain *preoccupation,* 
Emblem Lucina. Idleness makes you restless."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Lucina] 
I've never thought of it quite like that before, 
but yes, I do think you're right."
