[Fogado] 
Mm! Well, that's dessert done with. What a 
satisfying meal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
Your delectable praise is a boon to my soul."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
Did I detect a note of bitterness? Setting the 
stage for a hard conversation, I bet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Bunet] 
Indeed. Something you said has been eating at 
my mind. You...searched for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Fogado] 
Yeah. When I heard about the bandit raid on 
your town, I was devastated."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Fogado] 
There was basically nothing left. Your parents' 
cozy bistro...a pile of ashes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Bunet] 
That image is burned in my memory."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Fogado] 
I felt so helpless. I had come as fast as I could, 
but...it was too late."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Fogado] 
You'd fled along with everyone else. I had no 
idea where you might have gone."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Bunet] 
I'm sorry... It all happened so suddenly, I didn't 
have a chance to tell you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Fogado] 
It wasn't your fault. At any rate...after you left, 
I never stopped looking for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Fogado] 
I missed your delicious cooking, but more 
than that, I missed our conversations."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Bunet] 
I missed them too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Fogado] 
And then when I heard about the cooking 
tournament, I knew you'd enter."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Fogado] 
There was no way you'd miss a chance to show 
off to the whole queendom."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Fogado] 
If you think about it, your culinary skills are the 
reason we were reunited."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Bunet] 
I did lose the contest, however."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Fogado] 
Heh heh─this again! Bunet, it's not a big deal. 
You were out of practice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Fogado] 
If there was another contest today, you'd win 
hands down."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Bunet] 
Oh, Fogado... Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Bunet] 
I'm grateful you kept looking for me. That is 
why we can enjoy delicious moments like this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Bunet] 
You truly are my savior."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Fogado] 
""Savior"" still feels a little...strong, but, eh, 
I'll take it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Fogado] 
And just so you know...I'm never letting you 
leave me like that again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Bunet] 
The feeling is entirely mutual."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Bunet] 
I am your personal chef and retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Bunet] 
Most importantly, I am your best friend. And as 
such, I swear to be true."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Fogado] 
I'm glad. Nothing is sweeter than your 
friendship, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Bunet] 2 

[Fogado] 
Mm, delicious! Yet another culinary 
triumph, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Bunet] 
I could tell you were enjoying it because of that 
scrumptious smile on your face."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Fogado] 
Oh, before I forget. We need to circle back and 
talk about what you said the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Bunet] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Fogado] 
You know, the ""savior"" thing. I've been racking 
my brain, but I can't figure out what you meant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Bunet] 
Oh. That."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Bunet] 
I entered that contest to become the royal 
court's chef, and...I lost."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Bunet] 
It was the greatest shame of my life."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Bunet] 
Yet you found it in your heart to overlook my 
failure and hire me as your personal chef."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Bunet] 
I could never pay you back for that kindness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Fogado] 
Ah, I see. But, Bunet, I didn't really care about 
the contest itself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Fogado] 
I was just glad that you entered because it 
brought you back into my life."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Bunet] 
What? Was that your plan all along?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Fogado] 
Of course. It had been years since the last time 
we talked at your parents' bistro."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Bunet] 
That's true... What a bitter separation that was."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Bunet] 
But perhaps we should put this conversation on 
the backburner. Your main course is ready."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Bunet] 
You wouldn't want a sour memory to detract 
from the delightful flavor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Fogado] 
You make a good point."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Fogado] 
Whoa! What a stunning dish! Your food really is 
the best in the world."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Bunet] 2 

[Fogado] 
Mm, yes! This grilled fish is divine. Mm! It has 
such a supple mouthfeel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Bunet] 
I added a pinch of salt to suck out the moisture. 
That makes the fish nice and tender."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Fogado] 
Might be your finest work yet, Bunet, and that's 
saying something."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Bunet] 
Well, after all, I'm not just your retainer but also 
your personal chef."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Bunet] 
It is my duty to know what you like and prepare 
your meals accordingly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Fogado] 
I know! I'm a lucky man."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Fogado] 
But you forgot one thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Bunet] 
What?! Does it need more lemon? Is the 
presentation not to your liking?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Fogado] 
Oh, not the dish─the titles. Retainer, personal 
chef. You left one out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Fogado] 
Best friend."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Bunet] 
Ah. Right you are, Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Bunet] 
We have a long history─sharing meals together 
in my parents' bistro almost every day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Bunet] 
More than the meals, it was the hours we spent 
talking─well after patrons left─that I cherished."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Fogado] 
Yes. I'll always remember those days. Unlike 
somebody, who forgot we were even friends..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Bunet] 
I didn't forget. For friends and flavors alike, 
my memory is long and exacting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Bunet] 
It's just that now I see you as more of a savior 
than a friend."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Fogado] 
Psh, a savior? Me? How come?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Bunet] 
Heh... You don't understand. Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Bunet] 
Never mind that. Just finish your meal before it 
gets cold. Dessert will be ready shortly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Fogado] 
Dessert? Oh, baby!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Fogado] 
This is the best food in the world, bar none. 
I'll have a clean plate in no time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Bunet] 
The best food in the world... Heh..."
