[Kagetsu] 
Extremely satisfying! Today's sparring was 
excellent as usual."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Agreed. A few rounds with you is much better 
than my normal training."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
Agreed. Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
You know... I feel strong bonds of friendship 
between us, whether you do as well or not."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Even if you do not want to be friends, I am filled 
with joy merely to be your sparring partner."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Boucheron] 
Oh, but that's not the case. I want to have a 
strong bond with you too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Boucheron] 
So..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
So?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Boucheron] 
When will you tell me about your homeland?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Boucheron] 
Where I'm from, people usually bond by talking 
about their lives with each other."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
Hm. Then I shall do exactly that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
My home has something we call ""wa."" People 
are calm, wise. The fish and rice are delicious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Boucheron] 
Ah... What's your family like?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
My royal father has great swordsmanship. 
My priestess mother has mysterious powers."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Mmm... You must have inherited your skills from 
your father."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Boucheron] 
Do you see your family often?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
No. I abandoned them with my homeland."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Kagetsu] 
To put it simply, I was unable to resist my 
desire to see the world at large."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Boucheron] 
Do you ever miss them?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
Of course. But I cannot go back as I am. I must 
return only when I have...grown."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
I must earn glory and honors here so they will 
understand why I left. So they will not be angry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Kagetsu] 
What is it? Why are you crying?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Boucheron] 
It struck me while we were sparring..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Boucheron] 
For someone who seems so carefree, you must 
be carrying a heavy burden."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Kagetsu] 
No, stop it. You are going to make me cry 
as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Kagetsu] 
If we cry together, you will have to quiz me! 
Take responsibility and quiz me on my lips!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Boucheron] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Kagetsu] 
Kiss! Where I am from, when you weep together 
with someone, you must kiss afterward! Hurry!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Boucheron] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Kagetsu] 
Haha, only joking, my friend! We are playing 
around like two dear old pals!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Boucheron] 
Ah, hahaha! You've got to quit messing with 
me like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Kagetsu] 
Shall we spar some more? If you defeat me, 
I will tell you more of my home and past."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Boucheron] 
Sounds good. And if I yield, I'll tell you 
something about myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Kagetsu] 
Exciting! Let us begin!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Forgive me for making you wait. I mean no 
disrespect to our close bond of friendship."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
""Close bond""? We've sparred one time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
There is no greater bond than that of shared 
experience in battle!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Is that how it works where you're from?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Of course! It is only natural. Is it different 
where you are from?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Boucheron] 
Hm, somewhat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
Then how do you express bonds of friendship 
in your lands? Would you like to quiz me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Boucheron] 
Quiz you? On what subject?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
No, no. Quiz. When two people press their 
mouths together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
Come, give me a quiz!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Boucheron] 
A ""quiz"" when two people press their 
mouths together..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Boucheron] 
Oh! Do you mean a kiss?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes, yes! That. Come, give me one of those."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Boucheron] 
I'm afraid not. Kissing is for bonds of romantic 
love, not friendship."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
Is that so? Cultures of other countries are so 
foreign to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
Well, enough jokes. Let us begin our sparring!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Boucheron] 
You were...joking?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
Certainly! Everyone knows that friends do not 
quiz each other."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Boucheron] 
Don't toy with me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
Haha, if you are angry, show it as we fight!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Boucheron] 
All right, then. If you want the full Boucheron, 
then that's what I'll give you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
Ah, there is your war face! Now, come at me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
You are Boucheron of Firene, are you not? 
You appear quite formidable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
That is why I, Kagetsu of Elusia, challenge you 
to pit your abilities against mine!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Boucheron] 
You have an eye for skill, I see. Challenge 
accepted."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
Excellent! Now, let our weapons speak for us!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Ha! Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Boucheron] 
Hahaha, fancy! Needs more oomph, though!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
Phew! Magnificent duel! But let us be done 
for today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
I must say, that was thrilling! You did 
not disappoint."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
Your physique gives you power, but you are 
equally light on your feet in defense."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Boucheron] 
You weren't bad yourself. I haven't seen moves 
like yours before. They're tough to block."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
Have you not? That must be because I learned 
them in my homeland."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Boucheron] 
You're not from Elusia?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
Not originally. My home and its unique culture 
are far away from here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Do tell. That's very interesting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
If you wish to know more, you must duel me 
again! I do not part with secrets for nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Boucheron] 
Heh, all right. Count me in."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
Good then! I look forward to our next contest."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Boucheron] 
I'll be practicing."
