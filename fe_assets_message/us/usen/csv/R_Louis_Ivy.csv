[Ivy] 
Louis, would you indulge me with another cup 
of that wonderful tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Louis] 
You've put me in an awkward position, 
Princess Ivy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
If you are busy, it can certainly wait..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Louis] 
It isn't that. The problem for me is your 
recent mood."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Ivy] 
Still disappointed that I don't smile as easily as 
you'd like?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Louis] 
Not at all. You were incandescent with joy when 
you entered the room, in fact."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Ivy] 
Was I?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Louis] 
It is the very incandescence of that joy which 
poses such a problem for me, you see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Louis] 
Did you not realize how brightly you shone?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Ivy] 
No... I did not."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Louis] 
Such unadulterated joy isn't meant for my like. 
It should be reserved for others like yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Louis] 
My role is merely to facilitate these bright 
moments and then recede until I am needed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Ivy] 
Haha, I...have no idea how to respond to that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Louis] 
And now a laugh?! All of this is wasted on me, 
Princess Ivy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Louis] 
It is peculiar, though..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Louis] 
I still haven't the faintest idea of what causes 
you to beam this way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Ivy] 
How dare you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Ivy] 
I am not a monster, you know. I am capable 
of smiling around friends and allies."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Louis] 
Is that what I am in your eyes? An ally? Even... 
a friend?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Ivy] 
Don't be ridiculous. Hurry up and make the tea, 
would you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Louis] 
As you wish, Princess Ivy. I'll brew the most 
exceptional pot of tea you've ever tasted."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Ivy] 
I expect only the best from you, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Ivy] 2 
[Louis] 
What do you think, Princess Ivy? Does the sight 
of a pleasant gathering prompt any feelings?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Ivy] 
No. Nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Louis] 
How strange. I, for my part, find great comfort 
in their mundane joys and idle chatter."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Ivy] 
It would seem that phenomenon is unique 
to you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Louis] 
Oh? What a pity."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Ivy] 
Was that the full extent of your plan?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Ivy] 
Did you actually pin all your hopes on this sight 
inspiring me to...chat?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Louis] 
No. I haven't quite given up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Louis] 
Though I don't as yet have any other ideas."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Louis] 
Until I do, would you like a cup of tea? I'll put 
on a pot of the black tea blend I've been saving."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Ivy] 
Tea does sound lovely, actually. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Louis] 
Aha!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Ivy] 
What? What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Louis] 
I thought I detected the faintest hint of a smile 
just now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Ivy] 
Did you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Louis] 
Can I take it, then, that you like black tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Ivy] 
Yes. But if I happened to seem pleased, that was 
not the reason."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Ivy] 
I simply find your dedication to these efforts 
rather amusing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Louis] 
There's nothing so amusing about it. 
A princess's joy is a radiant thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Ivy] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Louis] 
Ah! Was that another smile?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Ivy] 
Oh, enough. You promised me tea. Let's have it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Louis] 
Haha, as you wish, Princess Ivy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Ivy] 2 

[Ivy] 
Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Louis] 
Yes, Princess Ivy?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Ivy] 
You always seem so cheerful. Is there some 
particular reason for it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Louis] 
No, this is simply my default expression."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Ivy] 
How curious."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Ivy] 
It may be due to my own reservedness that your 
demeanor leaves such an impression on me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Louis] 
It's true, now that you mention it, that I haven't 
seen much cheer in you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Louis] 
And what a sight that would be to see!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Ivy] 
What are you suggesting?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Louis] 
I have a keen eye for observing the way people 
socialize, you see."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Ivy] 
This is not reassuring."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Louis] 
Which is why I was so powerfully struck by the 
idea of seeing you in such a context."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Louis] 
The princess Ivy, among dear friends, wearing 
a wide grin...what a captivating thought!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Ivy] 
I will thank you not to cast me for any role in 
your imaginary theater."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Louis] 
The first step is to figure out what you might 
have cause to celebrate."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Louis] 
I think it may help if you accompany me 
for a time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Ivy] 
Your dedication to your goals, off-putting as 
they may be, is impressive."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Ivy] 
Very well, Louis of Firene. If your ambition is to 
make me smile, I invite you to do your best."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Louis] 
My best is all I can do, Princess Ivy."
