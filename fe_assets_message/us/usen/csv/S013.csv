MID_BT1_#001,"[Celica] b 
[Celica] Serious 
[Celica] 
, you are a kind soul."
MID_BT1_#002,"[Celica] Sad 
[Celica] 
However, the world cannot be saved with 
kindness alone."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
I've learned it takes strength as well."
MID_BT1_#004,"[Celica] 
Angry 
[Celica] 
One alone is a plan only for failure. Both are 
essential. Now show me you understand."
MID_BT2_#001,"[Celica] b 
[Celica] 
Smile 
[Celica] 
You seem quite happy, Alfred."
MID_BT2_#002,"[Alfred] t 
[Alfred] 
Relax 
[Alfred] 
I was thinking how you've been in Firene all this 
time, but you've never seen how strong we are!"
MID_BT2_#003,"[Celica] 
Angry 
[Celica] 
Well, you're awfully full of confidence."
MID_BT2_#004,"[Alfred] 
Angry 
[Alfred] 
It's hard not to be when you already know 
you're going to win the battle!"
MID_BT3_#001,"[Celica] b 
[Celica] Status 
[Celica] 
I must admit, going to battle against you is 
rather strange, Céline."
MID_BT3_#002,"[Céline] t 
[Céline] Sad 

[Céline] 
Oh, quite. I would rather chat over a cup of tea. 
Yet, as this is a trial, tea is not an option."
MID_BT3_#003,"[Céline] Strike 

[Céline] 
So instead of polite conversation, I will fight 
you to the last, yes?"
MID_BT3_#004,"[Celica] StandBy 
[Celica] 
Of course. Come at me now. Bring everything 
you have to bear and claim victory."
MID_ED1_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Celica] 2 
[Celica] 
The victory is yours. That was very well 
done, ."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Celica."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Celica] 
You grow stronger along with the power of 
your bonds."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Celica] 
Keep forging deeper connections with your 
allies as you fight this war."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Celica] 
Do that, and you will have the strength you 
need to save this world."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
I understand, and I'll do my best to strengthen 
the bonds I have─and forge new ones if I can."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Celica] 
Once you've used that strength to bring peace, 
it will be your kindness that you will lean on."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Celica] 
With kindness, you can build a world where 
no one hurts for the sake of hurting."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Alear] 
Do you really think that's something I can do?"
MID_ED1_#010,"[Celica] 
Oh, the road will be long and treacherous, but 
you're just the person to make the journey."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Alear] 
If you say so, Celica. I suppose there's no choice 
other than to try."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Celica] 
Heh, well, keep doing your best, . 
We'll bring kindness back to the world."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Alear] 
Yes, we will!"
MID_EV1_#001,"[Celica] b 
[Celica] 
Smile 
[Celica] 
The preparations for battle are complete. 
Let's begin."
MID_EV2_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
There. See the summoner? If we don't take 
them down quickly, things could get rough."
MID_LC1_#001,
MID_OP1_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Alear] 
There's something about this island... It's like 
a magical energy..."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Celica] 
The Seabound Shrine was located in a place 
quite similar to this."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
What kind of place was that?"
MID_OP1_#004,"[Celica] 
It sat in the Novis Strait, off of Zofia. There was 
an altar to the goddess Mila in a cave..."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Alear] 
I wonder if that means there's an altar here too."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Celica] 
This place reminds me of those days. I'd just 
begun to experience life."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Celica] 
I was so set on how I thought the world should 
be that I failed to heed my allies' advice."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Alear] 
That doesn't seem like you. Not to me, at least."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Celica] 
Back then, I visited Mila's temple, hoping to 
learn of a way to save my homeland."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Celica] 
Then we discovered there was a necrodragon 
on the island. That thing could have killed us all."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Celica] 
And we'd already fought a band of pirates... 
Saying it now, I realize how reckless we were."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Alear] 
It sounds to me like you were helping people as 
you traveled."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Celica] 
So, , would you have chosen 
the same as I did?"
MID_OP1_#014,"[Alear] 
Of course. I couldn't ignore anyone in need, no 
matter how dangerous the situation might be."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Celica] 
I know you wouldn't. You're courageous and 
strong─that's why we're here."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Alear] 
I suppose I don't understand. What do 
you mean?"
MID_OP1_#017,"[Celica] 
This is where you will face your trial."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Celica] 
Defeat me in combat and our bond will 
grow stronger."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Celica] 
Now take up your weapon, and let's see where 
your courage can take you."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Alear] 
I understand, and I'm going to win!"
