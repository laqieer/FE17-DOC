[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Diamant] 
Divine One? Are you training?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
Yes. I can't shake this feeling that I'm not 
strong enough."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
The truth is...I'm worried. And I feel weak. How 
can I restore peace to the world in this state?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Diamant] 
Huh."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
What is it, Diamant?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Diamant] 
It's just...surprising. I never would have guessed 
that the Divine One had doubts like this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
Of course I do. I worry a lot. My plate is full, 
and caterpillars keep dropping on it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Diamant] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
You know what I mean, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Diamant] 
Yes. And I see what you meant earlier about 
vulnerability. I feel closer to you too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
Really? All of a sudden? But you've seen this 
side of me before."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
I fled from that Corrupted soldier in such 
a panic."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Diamant] 
Haha, I remember."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Diamant] 
What I mean is, you make me feel safe enough 
to discuss my deepest concerns."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Diamant] 
If it weren't for you, I might still be clutching 
that medal and thinking about my father."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Diamant] 
I'm grateful for that. Thank you, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
I feel the same way. I appreciate having an ally 
to confide in too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
I suspect we have a lot in common."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Diamant] 
You might be right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
Let's keep this up. We may seem guarded to the 
others, but I'll always be open to chat with you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Diamant] 2 
[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
That's the most concerned I've ever seen you 
look, Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Diamant] 
Oh, Divine One. I apologize. Didn't think anyone 
else was here."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
What's that you're holding?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Diamant] 
This is a medal my father gave to me a while 
back. A commendation from the king."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
From King Morion..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Diamant] 
I was with our troops during an intense battle 
against Elusia. We found ourselves surrounded."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Diamant] 
We needed to make a quick retreat, so I took 
command out of sheer desperation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Diamant] 
When we returned, Father gave me this medal. 
It felt like the first time he saw me as a leader."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Diamant] 
But occasionally...I wonder..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Diamant] 
Was it my leadership that got us home, or was 
it pure luck? Perhaps I didn't earn this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alear] 
So, even the crown prince of Brodia suffers 
through moments of self-doubt."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Diamant] 
Sorry to shatter the illusion."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Diamant] 
To protect my country's reputation, I must 
insist you keep this conversation private."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
Of course. You saw me in a vulnerable moment 
with that Corrupted soldier, so let's call it even."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
But I will say one thing..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Diamant] 
Mm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
Knowing that you do have a vulnerable side 
makes me feel a bit closer to you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
Vulnerability isn't always a bad thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Diamant] 
Hm. You're a peculiar leader, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Diamant] 2 

[Alear] 
Ah! One of the Corrupted!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Diamant] 
The Corrupted? Where?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
Diamant! Help!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Diamant] 
Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
Thanks for the save, Diamant. Sorry to trouble 
you like that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Diamant] 
No trouble at all. However, I must ask..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Diamant] 
How did that creature manage to overpower 
and frighten the Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
It came out of nowhere! I just started running. 
I'm...not really good with the Corrupted."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Diamant] 
Not good with them? You handle them in battle 
just fine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
It's different on the battlefield. I can spot them 
first, then steel myself before engaging."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
That last Corrupted soldier got the drop on me. 
My guard was down."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
I'm an easy target for them outside of battle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Diamant] 
Hm, I don't follow."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
Isn't there something that makes your skin 
crawl, Diamant?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Diamant] 
I suppose...hairy caterpillars can have that sort 
of effect on me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
OK, let's say you knew you were about to see a 
big caterpillar. You'd have a chance to prepare."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Now imagine you're eating dinner at home, and 
a caterpillar suddenly drops onto your plate."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Diamant] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alear] 
Wouldn't that startle you? Wouldn't you cry out 
in surprise?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Diamant] 
I probably would."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Alear] 
That's what sneak attacks from the Corrupted 
feel like─caterpillars dropping on my plate."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Diamant] 
I understand. Very clear explanation, 
Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Alear] 
That was a strange example, but I'm glad you 
followed it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Alear] 
Sorry you had to watch me struggle like that. 
How unflattering..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025,"[Alear] 
I wish I was flawless like you, Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026,"[Diamant] 
Flawless? Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Diamant] 2 
[Diamant] 
Divine One? Is this a good time to talk?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Sure. What is it, Diamant?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Diamant] 
I'd like for you to have this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
You're giving me a ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Diamant] 
I am. It's made from the medal my father gave 
to me. I had it melted down and recast."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
The medal from your father?! Why would you 
do that? It was so important to you!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Diamant] 
In Brodia, medals and tokens change form 
whenever they change hands. It's tradition."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
I don't know about this. I couldn't possibly take 
something so precious from you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Diamant] 
You wanted us to keep relying on each other, 
right? And offer mutual support?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Diamant] 
Think of this as a reminder. I'll always be 
around when you need me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Diamant] 
So? Will you accept the ring, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
Well, Diamant..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
I'm not sure I'm worthy of such a personal gift."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
I guess I'll just have to do everything I can to 
live up to this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Diamant] 
So you will accept it?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
I will."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Diamant] 
I'm glad to hear it, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
This is actually pretty funny... I have something 
I'd like to give you as well."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Diamant] 
The Pact Ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
I was planning on giving this to you soon, but 
you beat me to the punch."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Diamant] 
But this ring is so important..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
So is the ring you just gave me!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
There's no one I'd rather have by my side, 
Diamant. I won't take no for an answer."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Diamant] 
Don't worry. I enjoy fighting beside you too 
much to turn this down. I accept your gift."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Diamant] 
Amazing. It's like I can feel the history of the 
Divine Dragons─the history of Lythos itself."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
I feel the history of Brodia within your ring 
as well, Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Diamant] 
It's changed in form between fathers and sons, 
but that item tells the story of my kingdom."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Alear] 
If we hope to add worthwhile stories of our 
own, we'd better help each other out."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Diamant] 
I'm not worried. When we work together, 
there's nothing we can't do."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Diamant] 
I vow to protect you, Divine One. From this 
point on, I will always fight by your side."
