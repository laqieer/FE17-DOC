[Bunet] 
As I have told you before, ingredients tell me 
how to cook them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Chloé] 
Yeah, so you've said."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
I never disregard their voices."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Bunet] 
Thus I have been searching high and low."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Bunet] 
I have sought out ingredients that ask─indeed, 
beg─to be made into folk food."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Chloé] 
Does that mean you found some?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Bunet] 
Yes. Look."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Bunet] 
A shellfish from the ponds of Solm and some 
mushrooms unique to the queendom's forests."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Chloé] 
Wow! What a weird color."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Bunet] 
And this? A numbing spice. It will stamp out all 
sensation as soon as it hits your tongue."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Chloé] 
A spice...that numbs?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Bunet] 
Heh, you're not scared, are you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Chloé] 
Who, me? I want to try this so bad that I can 
hardly stand it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Bunet] 
I knew your culinary courage would not falter."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Bunet] 
Now, behold. The ultimate folk food."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Chloé] 
Incredible! That's exactly the kind of careless 
presentation folk food oughta have!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Bunet] 
The splendor does not stop at its presentation. 
Please, have a taste."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Chloé] 
Oh boy, oh boy..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Chloé] 
Oh my goodness! That spice sure did a number 
on my tongue."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Chloé] 
But the sauce brings it right back to life, and 
the texture is just...indescribable!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Chloé] 
This is what made me fall in love with folk food. 
If a stall sold it, I'd eat there every day!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Bunet] 
It's strange... At first, I was simply moved by 
your passion for food."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Bunet] 
But now I see that this was a necessary step on 
the road to gastronomic expertise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Bunet] 
Whether it is served on a porcelain plate or in an 
unassuming wrapper, good food is good food."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Bunet] 
Street fare and gourmet food alike can bring joy 
to their eaters."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Chloé] 
Exactly! Thanks, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Bunet] 
Now, what would you like to eat next?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Chloé] 
You mean you'll fix me something else?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Bunet] 
I am always happy to take requests from a true 
food lover."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Chloé] 
No kidding? More gourmet-quality folk food... 
I'm so happy I might cry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Bunet] 
Please don't do that. My food and I are not 
going anywhere."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Chloé] 
Yeah. Good point. I'll take my time and 
think carefully."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Chloé] 
The next folk food I get from you is going to 
be the stuff of legend!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Bunet] 
Chloé. Here to beg me some more, I take it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
Sure am!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Bunet] 
From where did this bizarre love of folk food 
spring? You grew up in a noble family."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Chloé] 
Yeah, and all they served me back home was 
high cuisine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Chloé] 
For most people, that would be great. But me, 
I went to this Firenese festival one day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Chloé] 
I caught this salty-sweet scent from a back 
alley, so I followed it to find out what it was."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Bunet] 
That was how you discovered folk food."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Chloé] 
Yep. Without even thinking, I bought some food 
from the stall and tried it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Chloé] 
It was mind-blowing! The flavor, the smell, the 
texture... I'd never had anything like it in my life."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Bunet] 
To the child of a rich family, I see how it could 
offer some...perverse sense of thrill."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Chloé] 
Sadly, there was no chance my family would 
let me dine out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Chloé] 
And I could forget about folk food! They'd be 
horrified to know I ever even tasted it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Bunet] 
Oh, I see. You couldn't eat it while you lived 
at home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Chloé] 
Not necessarily. Once I'd had my first taste, 
I started going out behind my parents' backs."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Chloé] 
I'd eat the folk food on my pegasus and get 
rid of any evidence by tossing the wrappers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Bunet] 
Littering, you mean."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Chloé] 
Yeah, I feel bad about that now. I always take 
care to toss my trash properly these days."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Chloé] 
But that's my story in a nutshell."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Bunet] 
Your passion for food...I recognize it. I hesitate 
to admit, it is much like my own."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Bunet] 
You have persuaded me. For you─and only 
you─I will try my hand at making folk food."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Chloé] 
You mean it?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Bunet] 
But what I cook will be of the highest quality."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Bunet] 
I cannot cut corners on purpose, so do not 
complain if it differs from your expectations."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Chloé] 
No complaints, I promise! Thanks, Bunet! 
You've made me a very happy lady."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Chloé] 
Ooh, I can't wait to try your first batch of 
folk food!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Chloé] 
Please, Bunet?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Bunet] 
Apologies, Chloé, but no. I cannot. I will not."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Chloé] 
Pretty please? There's no one else here who 
could do it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Bunet] 
You have my answer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Chloé] 
Aww..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Bunet] 
Chloé, I live by certain principles."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Bunet] 
Chief among them? That the ingredients of this 
world deserve to be treated with dignity."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Bunet] 
I refuse to twist and corrupt them in order to 
make that...side-street dreck!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Chloé] 
Hey! I'm not taking that lying down. Folk food 
is an art form."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Chloé] 
Unique dishes, cooked without fuss, using 
ingredients that are unusual, cheap, or both."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Chloé] 
Imagine how amazing it would be if a world- 
class chef like you prepared some!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Bunet] 
No. You will have to ask someone else."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Chloé] 
But you have to!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Chloé] 
I'll do you a favor in return if I can try some 
gourmet-quality folk food, just once."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Bunet] 
Chloé... You know an artist when you see one. 
I appreciate that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Bunet] 
But I cannot do as you ask."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Bunet] 
The ingredients tell me how they want to 
be prepared. I will not violate their wishes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Bunet] 
Now, if you'll excuse me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Chloé] 
Oooh... This isn't over. I'll find a way to 
convince him. Guaranteed!"
