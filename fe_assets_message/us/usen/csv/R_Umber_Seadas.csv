[Seadall] 
Amber, can I have a word with you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Amber] 
Oh, Seadall. Sorry, but I kind of want to be 
alone for a while."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Amber] 
I'm still pretty embarrassed about that whole 
""rain savior"" thing. I really am a fool."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Seadall] 
That's what I wanted to talk to you about. 
It rained. You're a savior after all!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Amber] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Amber] 
Whoa."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Amber] 
Wait, no! I was there. I did all that stuff and it 
didn't rain a single drop!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Amber] 
I appreciate you trying to make me feel better..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Amber] 
But that kind of coddling just makes me feel like 
even more of a fool."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Seadall] 
I wouldn't do that. I'm telling you, Amber... You 
made it rain─just like the cards said you would."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Seadall] 
It didn't rain right where we were standing, but 
it did rain in a village just a few miles away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Amber] 
It did?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Seadall] 
It hadn't rained there for ages. In fact, the crops 
were on the verge of turning to dust."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Seadall] 
Then all of a sudden, it started pouring."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Seadall] 
I'm telling you, it happened right after you 
finished that weird rain chant of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Amber] 
Whoa. What? No. Really? I did that? Really?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Amber] 
I did it! I'm the legendary savior of some 
village somewhere!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Amber] 
I'm so...happy. Saving people is the best feeling 
in the entire world."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Seadall] 
When the fighting settles down, how about we 
pay a visit to that village? I'll introduce you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Seadall] 
""Hear ye, humble townsfolk. Come, meet your 
alpaca-loving savior!"" Yep, that's what I'll say."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Amber] 
No, don't say it like that! You're making me 
sound uncool again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Seadall] 
Don't worry. I promise to properly introduce 
the ""man foretold by legend."" You deserve it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Amber] 
Yes! And when you do, I'll thank the genius 
fortune-teller that predicted me!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Seadall] 
Haha, now it's my turn to be embarrassed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Amber] 
We make a pretty good duo, y'know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Seadall] 
I don't think we have a choice. According to 
my latest reading, we're destined to be friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Amber] 
Hah! Man, those cards are so smart."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Amber] 
Here's to a budding friendship. Nothing's gonna 
rain on our parade! Uh, unless I make it, that is."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Ah, it's the alpaca-loving savior himself. 
You made it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Hmm. I know you mean that, but the way you 
say it makes me sound...uncool."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Seadall] 
Well, how's this for cool... According to the 
cards, today is the day you become a savior!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Amber] 
Really? Today?! That's great!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Amber] 
So, uh...what should I do?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Seadall] 
Make it rain."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Amber] 
Hah, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Amber] 
Make it rain? Like, actual rain? From the sky? 
How do I do that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Seadall] 
That...I do not know. I'm not the savior. You are."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Amber] 
Oh, come on! You can't just make rain happen."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Seadall] 
Look, if you're the savior of legend, then you 
should be able to do it. So sayeth the cards."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Amber] 
Wow. The cards really believe in me that much? 
I can't let them down."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Amber] 
Right. OK. No big deal. I'm a legendary savior. 
I already have everything I need to make it rain."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Amber] 
Ain-ray... Ain-ray... Ain-ray..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Seadall] 
OK..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Amber] 
Ain-ray, all-fay own-day ow-nay...ease-play?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Seadall] 
I have never heard this...um...spell before."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Amber] 
Alpaca! You'll 'paca! Everyone will 'paca... 
for rain, rain, raaain!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Amber] 
Whoaaa, RAIN!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Seadall] 
Oh boy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Amber] 
How was that? Is it raining yet?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Seadall] 
Not a single drop."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Amber] 
Oh, come on!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Seadall] 
I guess...the fortune was off. I'm sorry. 
I thought I had it right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Amber] 
No, you're fine. I'm the one who just made a 
fool of himself. Tell your cards I'm sorry..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
What? Really? Here? Am I...reading this right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Amber] 
Seadall! What's going on? Is everything OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Seadall] 
Just doing a bit of fortune telling. The cards say 
that a man foretold by legend will soon appear."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Amber] 
Whoa! A man foretold by legend? Where? 
When? What else do the cards say?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Seadall] 
Well, this legendary man is young, gregarious, 
energetic...and rather handsome."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Amber] 
Ooh, that profile sounds an awful lot like me. 
If only my name was Greg! Man, so close."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Seadall] 
Ah, but he's also a fool."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Amber] 
Oh. That can't be me, then. Heh, poor Greg..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Seadall] 
Hmm... This fabled fellow also has a powerful 
connection to a certain animal. The...alpaca?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Amber] 
Alpacas?! No way! That has to be me. I AM the 
legendary Greg!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Seadall] 
You're the figure my cards are heralding?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Amber] 
I guess so! But what does that mean? Am I 
supposed to do something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Seadall] 
Well, according the cards, sometime in the near 
future, you are going to be a savior."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Amber] 
Whoa! A savior? Me?! That's the best!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Amber] 
How near is this near future going to be?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Seadall] 
Eh, that remains a bit...foggy. But never fear, 
I'll give you a shout as soon as things are clear."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Amber] 
Got it. I'll keep my ears perked up and my eyes 
pointed in both directions...just like an alpaca!"
