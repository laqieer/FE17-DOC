MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,You heard me speaking?
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,Think nothing of it.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,"I am, as ever, at your disposal."
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,"Divine One, we must speak about the 
upcoming battle if─"
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002,Ah. I see you are resting.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,I am quite sorry for waking you.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,Though you do wake up easier now.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,"Hm-hm. I must say, it brings a smile to my face."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,You have been working tirelessly of late.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,Keep pushing yourself and one day...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,"you will become a magnificent ruler, the same 
as Queen Lumera."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,I had thought to leave...
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,but I see I have roused you. Apologies.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,"By the way, do you happen to like knitting?"
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,"I have arrived slightly earlier than usual. 
How do you fare?"
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,"Please, take your time rising. I have no wish 
to rush you."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,I will be outside knitting until you need me.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,"I would like to show you what I'm working on, 
but wonder if you'll like it..."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,"Ah, you are awake?"
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,"Well then, I shall take my leave."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,"Many thanks for your resolute patrol 
of the Somniel."
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,"Divine One, please do forgive my intrusion."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,I see you are finding time to rest.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,Excellent choice. Rest focuses the mind.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,"You expressed a certain sense of guilt for 
troubling me, but I say..."
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,There is no greater pleasure than to serve.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,"Ah, forgive me. Perhaps I am pushing my 
service upon you again."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,"Ah, Divine One."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,How are you feeling today?
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,We are having absolutely lovely weather.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,Until such time as you awake...
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002,I shall attend to maintenance of the altar.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,Oh my. You are quick to rise today.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,I should have arrived sooner...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,I beg you to pardon my carelessness.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Ah, cleaning the altar like this..."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,It brings back a number of happy memories.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,When Queen Lumera would visit...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004,"she would gaze longingly at your 
sleeping face..."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,That I might be the one to wake you...
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,is indeed an honor.
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,"We decided to take turns waking you from 
your slumber, Divine One."
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#002,"Today, the duty falls to me."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,It's good to see you rising so promptly.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,"A fine morning, is it not?"
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,How soundly you sleep...
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,I hesitate to wake you needlessly.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,"Alas, such is my duty as a steward."
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004,"Divine One... Ahem, it's best you start 
getting up."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,Divine One.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,"For reference, what manner of food would you 
enjoy upon waking?"
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,"It is I, Vander, 32nd Steward of the Dragon."
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002,Oh...are you resting?
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,"As always, I shall endeavor to tend to all 
of your needs."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Hmm. What would be the most pleasant 
wake up experience?"
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,Perhaps if I deliver breakfast each morning?
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,"You have awakened, Divine One."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,I thought perhaps I might chat with you.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,I do enjoy our talks so.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,"Divine One. It is I, Vander."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002,May I have a quick word with─
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#003,"Hah, you are sleeping."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,Oh? You were only pretending to sleep?
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,So we're close enough now...
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,that you engage in mischief?
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,"I treasure your Pact Ring, Divine One."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,"In it, I sense the power of Queen Lumera..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,and of yourself.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,"By my oath, I will repay the honor..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,that you have bestowed upon me.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,"I am your steadfast knight, eternally."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,You say you heard something?
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,Perhaps it was a dream.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,"Or else the mere ramblings of an old man who 
thinks the world of you."
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,"Sorry to disturb you, but it is time to get up."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,I am pleased to see you wake so quickly...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,as it means we can spend a little time together.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,"I suspect, besides the Emblems, it is I who sees 
your sleeping face the most."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,"The day will come when I will entrust your care 
to the next generation of stewards..."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,"Still, as the 32nd Steward of the Dragon... No..."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,As Vander...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,"I pray you find a place in your heart to always 
remember me."
