[Clanne] 
Hi, Etie. Your new batch of pickles is ready."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Clanne] 
I used a mix of three vegetables this time. 
The thing is..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Etie] 
Is something wrong with them?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
They didn't end up tasting very good. I'm really 
sorry. I shouldn't give you these."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Clanne] 
I thought the mix would work out, but it didn't. 
I'll probably have to start again from scratch."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Etie] 
Hey. Clanne, don't worry about it. The taste 
isn't going to be a problem for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Clanne] 
Huh? Why not?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Etie] 
I loved the taste of the pickles you made, but I 
loved the care you put into them even more."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Etie] 
You didn't make just any old pickles─you knew 
they were for me before you even started."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Etie] 
And it's clear that you put a lot of thought into 
how I'd like them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Etie] 
Your pickles do more than ease the strain on 
my muscles."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Etie] 
Those good, good pickles soothe my soul too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Etie] 
So, don't worry about the taste. I'll be happy to 
eat them anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Clanne] 
Etie... That's really nice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Etie] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Clanne] 
Um... Was that your stomach?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Etie] 
You heard that, did you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Clanne] 
So when you said the taste wasn't a problem 
just now, were you speaking from the heart..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Clanne] 
or were you speaking from the gut?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Etie] 
I meant every word! Sheesh. Don't make me 
take it all back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Clanne] 
Oh, isn't it almost time for your workout?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Etie] 
Yeah, it is. Can I have a few pickles before I go?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Clanne] 
Don't say I didn't warn you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Etie] 
Clanne, come on. I told you that doesn't matter, 
and I meant it. Now let me taste the love!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1

[Etie] 
There you are, Clanne."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
Were you looking for me? Are you out of 
pickles already?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Etie] 
I'm ashamed to say this, but yes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Clanne] 
That was pretty fast."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Clanne] 
But I noticed you've been training hard, so I 
suspected they might not last that long."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Etie] 
I'm impressed. Not much gets by you, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Clanne] 
Heh heh, it's nothing much. I just like to do 
what I can for our hardworking soldiers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Etie] 
Those pickles were something else. I used to 
stay sore for a while after a workout."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Etie] 
But ever since I started eating those pickles of 
yours, it hasn't been as much of a problem."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Etie] 
Plus, the taste is amazing. I couldn't keep my 
hands out of that jar."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Clanne] 
Really?! You don't know how happy I am to 
hear that! I'll gladly make you another batch."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Etie] 
You don't mind, do you? I'd appreciate it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Clanne] 
Oh, are there any vegetables in particular you 
want me to pickle?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Clanne] 
It can be whatever you like─you can make 
pickles out of pretty much anything."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Etie] 
Um...I'm drawing a blank right now. Is it OK if 
I leave it up to you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Etie] 
You do seem to have been paying close 
attention to my preferences, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Clanne] 
Haha, I suppose I have. Don't worry, I'll pick 
out the perfect vegetables for you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Etie] 
I know you will."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1

[Etie] 
Phew. That ought to be enough running 
for today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Looks like you had a good workout there, Etie!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Etie] 
Oh, it's you. What are you doing here?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Clanne] 
I thought you might want these when you 
were finished."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Etie] 
What's that you've got in the jar?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Clanne] 
Homemade pickles. They should really help 
you recover after a tough workout!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Clanne] 
Here, try one."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Etie] 
Sure, why not? Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Etie] 
Oh! This isn't bad. It's got just the right 
amount of tartness that I like."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Clanne] 
I'm glad I got it right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Clanne] 
I know you're serious about your body, so I was 
careful to keep them delicious but healthy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Etie] 
Really? You did that just for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Clanne] 
Yep! And that's not all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Clanne] 
I also slept with them under my pillow. Kind of 
like how hens take care of their eggs."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Etie] 
No kidding? That's...weirdly charming. You're a 
good one, Clanne."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Clanne] 
You can keep the whole jar. If you ever want 
more, just let me know!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Etie] 
Oh, I will. Thanks for brightening up my day!"
