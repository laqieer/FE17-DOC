[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Your strength is incredible! I have never been 
so cornered by my opponent!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Jade] 
You put up quite a fight yourself. I can't believe 
we ended with a draw."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
It is rare I take pleasure in stalemates."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jade] 
It was satisfying, wasn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Tell me, Jade, how did you develop such 
strength? Does it come from your family?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jade] 
Not at all. My upbringing was rather peaceful 
and quiet, actually."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jade] 
My father is a gemologist, and my mother is an 
artisan. She makes the most beautiful jewelry..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
So they are untrained in battle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jade] 
That's right. When I was younger, I helped my 
mother with her work."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Jade] 
Unfortunately, I turned out to be all thumbs...so 
I eventually took a job guarding our local mine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
This change is quite sudden."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jade] 
Is it? It didn't feel that sudden. I've always 
enjoyed physical tasks."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jade] 
Bandits would keep trying to steal from that 
mine...so I got plenty of exercise. Fun times."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
Ah. Now I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Jade] 
I guarded that mine for years and years... Folks 
in town started calling me the ""Iron Wall."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jade] 
Eventually a royal soldier heard about me and 
suggested I enter Brodia's fighting tournament."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
And you won it straightaway, I'd imagine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jade] 
I fought my way to the top spot, met Prince 
Diamant, and officially became his retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jade] 
Whoops. I meant to ask you more questions, but 
I ended up going on and on about my own past."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Jade] 
I guess it's just like you said, Kagetsu. We each 
have our stories..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
Indeed. And now that our tapestries interweave, 
they point us toward our shared future."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Jade] 
Like turning the pages of a novel."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Kagetsu] 
Precisely! So when will we have our rematch?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Jade] 
Just name a place and time, and I'll be there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Jade] 
I can already tell that, in the novel of my life, 
our duels are sure to be pages worth rereading."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
I come from Pale Sands, which is located on 
Solm's northeastern frontier."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
My home is not commonly visited by outsiders. 
Its culture is precious and unique."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Jade] 
What was different about it? Any examples 
come to mind?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
My clothing, for a start. It must seem different 
to your eye."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Our architecture as well. You will not see finer 
woodworking anywhere."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
We also worship differently. We do not revere 
Divine or Fell Dragons."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
We have other dragons. They are long and lithe. 
I have not seen them in other countries."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Jade] 
Hm! Interesting. I'd like to see that myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
I can show you pictures in scrolls. But you must 
agree to another duel with me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Jade] 
We haven't had our first duel yet! Now, let me 
get through all of my questions."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jade] 
What can you tell me about your family?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
Apart from my parents, I have one younger 
brother and one younger sister."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Jade] 
Ah. You're the firstborn, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes. It was my parents' intention for me 
to carry on our family's legacy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
I was...unable to do this, however."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
I could not bear to live all of my days without 
ever knowing the world at large."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jade] 
Oh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes. It was for that reason I decided to leave."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Kagetsu] 
I left written words behind to explain my 
intentions, and to ask them not to look for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
And so I left, and here I am."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Jade] 
That's an amazing backstory, Kagetsu. Your life 
is like an adventure novel that writes itself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
We each have our stories."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Kagetsu] 
Now, will you indulge me in that duel?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Jade] 
Sure. I'm out of questions, and a deal is a deal, 
so...I'm ready when you are."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Jade! Face me! Show me your skill in battle!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jade] 
No, thanks. I'll pass."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
So quick to turn me aside! Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
I have heard your strength has won you 
tournament victories in Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Such strength is meant to be shown and used. 
Do not keep it to yourself!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jade] 
I didn't receive orders to engage you. I have no 
personal grudge against you. Why fight?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
Jade, Jade, Jade. You disappoint me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
What I hear of your skill is so exciting! Please, 
I must see it for myself!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
How can I earn the favor of this bout? I will do 
anything you ask."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Jade] 
Anything?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jade] 
In that case..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Jade] 
Would you be willing to answer a few personal 
questions before we battle?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
Heh, easily. May I ask why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Jade] 
I need to round out a character for a new book 
I'm outlining. You can help me fill in the gaps."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
I need only talk about myself?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jade] 
That's right. And it sounds like we have a deal."
