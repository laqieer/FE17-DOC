[Veyle] 
My goodness, that was so much fun!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
Hahaha! Looks like somebody's not scared of 
riding wolves anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
It's true! I've conquered my fear."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
Thank you so much, Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Timerra] 
Don't mention it. Um...is something wrong? 
You look a little misty-eyed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Veyle] 
It's just...you always treat me like I'm a 
normal person."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Timerra] 
All I did was plonk you onto a wolf and say ""go."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
That's it exactly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Veyle] 
You treat me like...a friend. It makes me happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Timerra] 
Hehehe! If you're happy, I'm happy. Though, 
I guess I didn't realize all of this was so special."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Veyle] 
It is. Very special."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Veyle] 
I don't think I can thank you enough."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Timerra] 
Aww, it was nothing, Lady Veyle. Honest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Veyle] 
Heh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Veyle] 
So, I guess you'll be returning to Solm after 
the war is over?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Veyle] 
You'll probably be really busy...getting ready 
to be the next queen and all of that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Timerra] 
Yeah. It feels like my to-do list is as big as 
the queendom itself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Veyle] 
I suppose we won't be able to hang out with 
each other anymore, like normal friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Timerra] 
What, you think I'll become a total fuddy-duddy 
when I'm queen?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Timerra] 
Give me a little credit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Timerra] 
I'll sneak out of the palace to hang out with you, 
if that's what it takes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Timerra] 
And we will hang out. A lot! No matter what 
my title is. Because that's what friends do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Veyle] 
I'd...really like that, Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Veyle] 
Yeah, it's a plan!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
I told her I couldn't do it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Veyle] 
I told her I wasn't ready to ride a wolf all by 
myself! What was she thinking?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Timerra] 
Was that fun, or was that fun?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Veyle] 
I thought I was going to die!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Timerra] 
I thought you would too! Nearly went right over 
that cliff."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Veyle] 
I didn't know how to turn! And I didn't know 
I didn't know how until I was already riding!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Timerra] 
Well, you made it! All you needed was a little 
effort and a positive attitude."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Veyle] 
All I needed was a miracle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Timerra] 
But hey, really cleared your mind, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Veyle] 
I mean, I was so scared I couldn't actually think. 
So...yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Timerra] 
Good! You're learning. The biggest thrills in life 
always involve a little fear."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Veyle] 
Hehe..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Veyle] 
I'm sure you're right, Timerra. It is good to do 
things that make us uncomfortable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Timerra] 
Exactly! Now, come on! Round two!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Veyle] 
What?! Round two? Must I?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Veyle] 
I thought I was going to die! I mean, I'm pretty 
sure I did die. Twice!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Veyle] 
I screamed so hard I lost my voice at one point."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Timerra] 
So, what'd you think of your first time tearing it 
up on wolfback?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Veyle] 
It was...exciting. But mostly terrifying."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Timerra] 
Haha! You're such a kidder, Lady Veyle!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Veyle] 
But I'm not kidding. Not even a little bit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Veyle] 
It's a miracle I'm still alive. In fact, I can't 
believe I am alive."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Timerra] 
Takes your mind off everything though, right? 
Couldn't you feel your worries just...float away?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Veyle] 
Heh...I guess you could say that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Timerra] 
Good. You looked a little tense earlier. I thought 
this might be a good way to unwind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
I do sometimes wonder if it's OK for me to be 
here with all of you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Timerra] 
I hear ya. But next time you start feeling like 
that, you let me know, all right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Timerra] 
We can tear it up to the horizon and back!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Veyle] 
OK. I will. And Timerra...thank you."
