[Hortensia] 
Clanne? What are you doing?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Clanne] 
Princess Hortensia?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Sorry to startle you! If you're nervous because 
of earlier, I'm not mad or anything."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
I told everyone that I made up the fan club. 
They said they'd assumed that, so..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Hortensia] 
I guess they already thought I lied. Rude."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Clanne] 
A-about that... I wanted you to see something, 
Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Hortensia] 
Hm? A slip of paper? And some writing..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Hortensia] 
""Princess Hortensia Appreciation Society. 
Club President... Clanne""?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Hortensia] 
This is...a membership card. You made this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Clanne] 
When we talked before, you were...abrasive but 
also kind. And you owned up to your mistakes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Clanne] 
And...I thought that was neat. So I made a 
fan club."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Hortensia] 
Aww, Clanne..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Clanne] 
Maybe it's too late, but I'll be cheering you on, 
Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Hortensia] 
Ugh...late, yeah. But even so..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Aaah, this makes me SO happy! Thank you, 
Clanne!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Clanne] 
Now let's get out and promote the fan club! 
I'm sure lots of people will want to join!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Hortensia] 
Actually... You know what? I think I'd like to 
have a fan club of one for a while."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Clanne] 
Really? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Well, obviously if it's a club about me, a ton of 
fans from all over will join eventually."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Hortensia] 
So it might be nice to have a smaller cheering 
section while I still can, you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Clanne] 
Aw...that does sound nice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Clanne] 
All right, I'll just have to be the best one-person 
cheering section I can be!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Hortensia] 
Can't ask for more from a fan-club president."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 
[Clanne] 
Princess Hortensia, can I ask why you want to 
have a fan club?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Hortensia] 
Why? Simple."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Hortensia] 
I already told everyone I have one."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Hortensia] 
That means if I don't get one soon, it'll be like 
I lied to them. And I'm not a liar!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Clanne] 
I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Hortensia] 
That's why I need your help. Or are you saying 
you don't want to help me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Clanne] 
It's not that I don't want to..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Clanne] 
But fan clubs are based around someone you 
really admire."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Hortensia] 
So...admire me, then. What's the problem?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Clanne] 
Uh, um..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Clanne] 
It's hard to cheer on someone who...doesn't... 
you know...earn it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Hortensia] 
Hey, hey, hey! Are you saying I don't deserve 
your praise and devotion?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Clanne] 
Sorry..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Hortensia] 
Ah... Fine. That's fair. I'll drop it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Bullying you into starting a fan club would be 
sad and desperate. Sorry to waste your time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Clanne] 
N-no problem."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Hortensia] 
I gotta say, Clanne, I like that you're honest. It's 
actually kinda refreshing to be told ""no."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Hortensia] 
All right, I'm heading back. I've got some lies to 
apologize for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Clanne] 
How...admirable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Ah, there you are, Clanne!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Huh? I mean, hello...Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Hortensia] 
That's right! It's the princess of the mighty 
kingdom of Elusia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Hortensia! Whoo! Hoo-hoo! Yeah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Clanne] 
Yes... Did you need something? From me, 
I mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
It so happens, a little birdie told me..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Hortensia] 
You, my Clanne-shell, are the president of my 
fan club!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Clanne] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Hortensia] 
What do you mean ""what?"""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Hortensia] 
And shouldn't you be...I don't know, swooning? 
Your idol is right here, talking to you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Clanne] 
Um, Princess Hortensia, I think you might have 
gotten a bit confused..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Hortensia] 
Confused? Confused how?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Clanne] 
Well...the fan club I'm the president of is..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Hortensia] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Hortensia] 
You're the president of a fan club for your 
own liege?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Clanne] 
I'm so sorry for the...misunderstanding."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Hortensia] 
Ugh. Embarrassing..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Wait! Clanne! The princess of Elusia has orders 
for you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Clanne] 
Wha?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Hortensia] 
I want you...to form me a fan club!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Clanne] 
I don't work for you!"
