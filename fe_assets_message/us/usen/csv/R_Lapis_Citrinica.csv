[Citrinne] 2 
[Lapis] 
There you are, Citrinne! I've been waiting."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Oh? Whatever for, Lapis?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
I was hoping to join you for midnight training. 
It's sure to be more fun with a partner, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Oh my! But it would be terrible of me to deprive 
you of a full night's rest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Lapis] 
Please. I'm the terrible one. I still feel bad about 
the last time we talked."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Lapis] 
Besides, I can't sleep if I know a good friend is 
working through the night."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Lapis... You're so kind."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Citrinne] 
I had something that I wanted to offer you as 
well. Here, take this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lapis] 
A note? No, an address. What is this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Citrinne] 
That's the mailing address for one of my 
family's spare manors in the heart of town."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Citrinne] 
We haven't lived there in quite a while, so it's 
only staffed by grounds- and housekeepers."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Lapis] 
OK...but why are you giving me the address?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Citrinne] 
If you wish to hide your rural origins, you must 
consider where your care packages come from."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Citrinne] 
Think of this as your new forwarding service!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Citrinne] 
If your parents send their packages there, the 
staff will swap addresses and route them here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Why, your family could even use that address as 
a vacation home. Or they could just move in."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Citrinne] 
The manor is theirs to use as they like."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lapis] 
Wow..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Lapis] 
Citrinne, thank you. I didn't realize how much 
you cared."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Citrinne] 
Think nothing of it. I'm just looking out for one 
of my dearest friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lapis] 
It's a wonderful offer, but...I can't accept it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Citrinne] 
What? Why not?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Lapis] 
My family isn't noble, but I'm proud of them. 
I can't ask them to hide where they're from."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lapis] 
I'm still nervous about other people finding out, 
but at least I won't have to worry around you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Citrinne] 
Oh my..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Citrinne] 
We are quite the pair, aren't we? Each of us has 
what the other lacks."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Lapis] 
And we both reach out when the other 
needs help."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Citrinne] 
Not a bad working relationship."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Lapis] 
Not bad at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Lapis] 
Do you think Prince Alcryst had this balance 
in mind when he selected us as his retainers?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, I doubt it. I know you're enamored with 
him, but Alcryst isn't that clever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Lapis] 
What? I-I am not!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Citrinne] 
Goodness! You're blushing. Your cheeks are as 
red as the carpets in the royal court."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Lapis] 
Come on, don't tease me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Lapis] 
Besides, those carpets aren't that red. You 
should see the tomatoes they grow back home!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Citrinne] 
Oh? That sounds like a fun day trip. Would you 
show me around sometime?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Lapis] 
Sure! But don't bring any money. The farmers 
back home prefer to use a barter system."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038,"[Citrinne] 
How rustic! I've always wanted to try bartering. 
I could stand to part with a few necklaces..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#039,"[Lapis] 
Heh, careful! With goods like that, you'll end up 
needing that spare manor for tomato storage."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Lapis] 
Ahh, I love packages from Mom and Dad. 
I wonder what this could possibly be..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Lapis] 
Haha, as if I don't already know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lapis] 
Ooo, they sent some really good ones this time! 
These look extra yummy. Mmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Citrinne] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Lapis? What has you cooing and humming?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lapis] 
AH! Citrinne?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Lapis] 
You really scared me. Don't sneak up on people 
in the dark, making such a scary face..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Should I have worn a mask? I doubt that would 
have been less frightening."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Citrinne] 
This is just my face, Lapis. Don't be cruel."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lapis] 
Sorry. I didn't mean it. You just really 
startled me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, what tasty-looking yams! Did you have 
someone fetch these from the countryside?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Lapis] 
No, I didn't. They, uh... I..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Citrinne] 
It looks as if your parents sent them. Does your 
family...own land near a potato farm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Citrinne] 
It was my understanding that your parents live 
in town. Is that not the case?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Lapis] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lapis] 
OK. I'll tell you the truth, Citrinne. My parents 
don't live anywhere near town."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Oh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Lapis] 
My parents─actually, my whole family─lives in 
the countryside where these taters came from."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Citrinne] 
Is that so? But you've always said that─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Lapis] 
I lied. I shouldn't have, but I did. Please don't 
tell anyone else, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Citrinne] 
I won't. Of course I won't. But...I'm confused. 
Why would you lie about such a thing?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Lapis] 
I was trying to make myself seem less...you 
know...rural."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Lapis] 
I worry about that all the time. Prince Alcryst 
is royalty. You're part of his extended family."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Lapis] 
A bumpkin like me doesn't belong next to such 
noble company."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Citrinne] 
Lapis! That's not true! It doesn't matter if─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Lapis] 
It matters to me. I wish my family tree was as 
impressive as yours, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Lapis] 
Things are different for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, Lapis..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Citrinne] 
You and I make a perfect match."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029,"[Lapis] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#030,"[Citrinne] 
You see your family's social standing as your 
hindrance, while I see lack of strength as mine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#031,"[Citrinne] 
Each of us has what the other lacks."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#032,"[Lapis] 
Huh. You're right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#033,"[Citrinne] 
Your secret is safe with me. I'll leave you be. 
I have to begin my midnight training, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#034,"[Citrinne] 
Good night, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#035,"[Lapis] 
G'night, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Ha! Hyah! Hup!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Ah..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Citrinne] 
That was a bit better than yesterday...but still 
far from acceptable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Lapis] 1 
[Lapis] 
Citrinne? What are you doing up so late?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Citrinne] 
Ah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, Lapis. You frightened me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
If you must know, I was just...brushing up on 
my ballroom dancing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Lapis] 
Hmm. You're not a very good liar. I could see 
you using magic. Are you training in secret?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Citrinne] 
You found me out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Lapis] 
Working this late can't be good for your health. 
You should really get some sleep soon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Citrinne] 
I appreciate your concern, Lapis, but...I can't 
let myself rest."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lapis] 
You can't?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Citrinne] 
If I had your strength, I might not have to train 
myself well into the small hours of the night."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Citrinne] 
But...things are different for me. I must, must, 
must grow stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Lapis] 
Oh. Citrinne, that's..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Don't stay up for my sake. I promise to rest as 
well, but only after I've done enough for tonight."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Lapis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Lapis] 
Just don't push yourself too hard, OK? G'night."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Citrinne] 
Good night, Lapis."
