MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
Jade! Are you OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Jade] 
Yes, Divine One. I just made it back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Thank goodness. You don't look hurt...but I 
can't believe you did something so reckless."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
Sneaking out to ambush those bandits at their 
hideout all by yourself... Unbelievable!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jade] 
I knew the risk I was taking. I had to settle 
things once and for all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jade] 
If I didn't, their revenge plots might have 
dragged on forever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jade] 
Everything is fine now. The bandits have been 
defeated and placed in military custody."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Jade] 
I made sure to leave a lasting impression...and 
plenty of bruises. They won't be back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Jade] 
Thank you for being so concerned. You won't 
have to worry about my safety anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
Amazing. You took care of it all on your own, 
just like you said you would."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
I admit...I'm a bit disappointed. I really hoped 
that I would be able to help you with this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Jade] 
Oh, I would never drag you into my unresolved 
business like that, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
Why not? We're friends, Jade."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jade] 
Friends..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Jade] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
What's wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jade] 
I'm just happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Jade] 
I know I can be hard to read sometimes. I'm not 
very good at expressing my emotions."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Jade] 
But I am sorry for making you worry. Thank you 
for caring about me, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alear] 
You're very welcome, Jade."

[Alear] 
Hello, Jade. Nice weather today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Jade] 
Yes, Divine One. It is."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
Did you see that sunset yesterday? Gorgeous."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Jade] 
Yes, it was."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Jade] 
Divine One... We've been running into each 
other a lot lately, haven't we?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
I suppose we have. I'm not bothering you, am I?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Jade] 
I think I know what's going on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Jade] 
You want to be nearby in case those bandits 
try to attack me again. Is that right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
Ah. I guess I didn't hide it very well."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Jade] 
I appreciate your concern, but I can handle 
them myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Jade] 
You don't have to watch over me. I'm sure you 
have better things to do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
Well...I do have some free time that I could be 
enjoying right now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
You wouldn't mind if I just relaxed around here 
for a while, would you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I know how strong you are, Jade."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
I'm not doing this because I think you can't 
handle it. I'm here because I want to help."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Jade] 
As you wish, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Alear] 
Jade! Are you OK?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jade] 
Oh. Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
I heard you were attacked by bandits! I rushed 
here to check on you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Jade] 
Thank you, but I'm fine. I drove them all away."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
Why did they attack you like that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jade] 
I've run into that group before."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Jade] 
I used to be the guard for the mine near my 
hometown. I stopped them from looting it once."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jade] 
They must have tracked me down for revenge."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
Now? After all this time?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Jade] 
I was pretty infamous among the bandits in our 
area. They used to call me the ""Iron Wall."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jade] 
Looks like I'm the target of a few deep, long- 
standing grudges."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Jade] 
But it's fine. I can handle anything they throw 
at me. They're not much of a threat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
I know you're strong, Jade, but I'm still worried."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
If you ever need backup, you can always count 
on me. I'll do whatever I can."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Jade] 
Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you like that, 
Divine One...but thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Alear] 
Say, Jade... Your father studies gems, and your 
mother is a jeweler. Is that right?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Jade] 
That's right, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Jade] 
I used to live in a mining town. Everyone there 
had jobs related to minerals and gems."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Jade] 
I would try to help my mother with her jewelry 
from time to time, but I was all thumbs."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Jade] 
So, in the end, I settled on being a guard for our 
town's mine."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
You've probably been dealing with gems and 
jewelry since you were a child."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Jade] 
Sure. I guess I'm more knowledgeable 
than most."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
In that case, I'd like you to tell me what you 
make of this..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Jade] 
The Pact Ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Jade] 
Hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Jade] 
There's a mysterious power inside. No other 
ring has ever felt like this..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
That's just how it felt for me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
Well, that ring and its power are both yours 
now, Jade."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Jade] 
Huh? Wh-what do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
I mean they're yours─if you'll have them. 
Let them be a symbol of our growing bond."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
I want to stay by your side, Jade. Then you'll 
never have to fight alone again."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
So...will you take the ring? Please?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
You really aren't kidding about being hard to 
read, are you?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
But I think I understand. I know what you're 
feeling right now."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Jade] 
Yes. I know you do."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Jade] 
I'm happy. I'm very, very happy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Jade] 
It really is the Pact Ring... Thank you. So much."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Will you continue to walk the road ahead 
by my side?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Jade] 
Of course, Divine Dragon ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Jade] 
The bond we share is now stronger than iron... 
and nothing will break it."
