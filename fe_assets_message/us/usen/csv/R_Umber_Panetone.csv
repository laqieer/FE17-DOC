[Amber] 
Hey, Panette. I won't tell anyone about that 
""haunted mansion"" incident if you don't..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Amber] 
The rumors didn't say anything about a second, 
perfectly normal mansion being out there!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Panette] 
Yes...and they were not exactly pleased to 
have company."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Panette] 
How mortifying."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Amber] 
I wish that was all. I thought that stuffy guy 
was the legendary knight! I shook his hand..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Amber] 
I already told Prince Diamant. He laughed until 
he cried. Called me ""the legendary knucklehead."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Panette] 
The legendary knucklehead, you say..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Panette] 
Hahaha! That's not bad!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Amber] 
Oh, fine. Laugh it up. I should really learn to 
keep my big mouth shut..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Amber] 
I'm really sorry I dragged you into that mess."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Panette] 
Think nothing of it. I had a rather good time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Amber] 
You did? Even though we didn't see a ghost?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Panette] 
Yes, well, that was unfortunate."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Panette] 
I have a number of interests that other people 
find strange. Ghosts, for example."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Panette] 
You are much the same in that respect. Some 
might consider you an odd duck, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Panette] 
I like odd ducks!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Amber] 
Huh. That doesn't FEEL like a compliment..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Panette] 
Why, of course it is!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Amber] 
Oh! Well, great!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Amber] 
I was worried you regretted it, because...I was 
really glad you went with me, Panette."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Amber] 
I don't know many people who enjoy chasing 
rumors and legends and stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Amber] 
If you ever need an adventure buddy to check 
out a legend of your own, just say the word."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Panette] 
I know a legendary spot we can go to."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Amber] 
You do? Where?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Panette] 
A restaurant with very, very spicy food."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Amber] 
Uh, is the food enchanted? Or was it built on 
an ancient burial ground? Or..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Panette] 
They have a dish called the Tongue Melter... It's 
so hot, no one has ever finished an entire bowl!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Amber] 
Ooh, it's that kind of legend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Amber] 
Well, a legend is a legend. Count me in─and I'll 
foot the bill! Least I can do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Panette] 
Huzzah!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Amber] 
We made it! We've arrived at the mansion."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Ah...I'm trembling. My heart is pounding. I've 
got goosebumps!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Panette] 
Hmm... Nary a ghost in sight... Let us keep going 
and explore further."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Amber] 
Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You don't want to 
rush this. The ghost could be hiding anywhere..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Panette] 
Oh, really? Like where?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Amber] 
Mwa ha haaa..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Amber] 
Why, the ghost could even be...right HEEERE!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Panette] 
Hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Panette] 
Are you certain? I see nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Amber] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Amber] 
Oh, never mind. I was just trying to play a little 
trick on you, Panette."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Amber] 
You didn't even flinch! You must have nerves 
of pure steel."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Amber] 
Anyway, maybe this place isn't haunted 
after all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Panette] 
Hmm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Amber] 
I'm happy the mansion part of the rumors held 
up, but...a wandering ghost? I just don't see it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Panette] 
It is here..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Amber] 
Aw, Panette! That's the spirit. Normally I'd be 
holding out hope too, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Panette] 
No, Amber. It is here."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Amber] 
Oh! I get you. I guess every house does have its 
own ghost, in a poetic way. That's really─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Panette] 
That is not what I meant. It is HERE! 
As in...THERE! Look!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Amber] 
Do what now?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Amber] 
Whoa..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Amber] 
Whoa."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Amber] 
WHOA!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Amber] 
Ugh, I have to check that place out, but it's too 
dangerous to go by myself..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Panette] 2 

[Panette] 
Pardon me, but I couldn't help overhearing... 
Are you planning a trip somewhere?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Amber] 
Listen to this, Panette. There are rumors about 
a nearby forest that hides an old mansion..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Panette] 
Oh? I have never heard of this place."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Amber] 
Me neither! I just learned about it. According to 
local legends, a famous knight lived there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Amber] 
He was a brave and noble warrior who fought 
as if he would never die...right up until he died."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Amber] 
The very next day, people say the knight's spirit 
could be seen wandering inside the mansion..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Panette] 
How extraordinary!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Amber] 
Poor guy doesn't know he died! Now he roams 
his own halls as a shadow of his former self."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Panette] 
Would that not make him...a ghost?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Amber] 
Oh, huh... Well, if you want to get all technical 
about it, then sure."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Panette] 
Why, I should like to see this place for myself! 
I adore ghosts."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Amber] 
You do?! Great! Let's check it out together."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Amber] 
That'll be way, way easier than checking it out 
all by myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Amber] 
Even Prince Diamant turned me down─and he's 
not afraid of anything!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Panette] 
Then pray bring me along. I can think of nothing 
that would make me happier."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Amber] 
Yes! That settles it. Just don't blame me if you 
get scared out of your big, pointy boots!"
