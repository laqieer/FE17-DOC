[Rosado] 
Hey, Pandreo! Take a look at this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
It's a landscape I drew of your church."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Whoa! You made this just for me? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Rosado] 
Something I wanted you to see! Look─this lady. 
She was really there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Pandreo] 
She looks so happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Rosado] 
Yeah! I captured her face exactly as you see it. 
She was overjoyed to be at your church."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Pandreo] 
I see... So I really am helping people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Pandreo] 
That's what I've been working toward. Giving 
people some joy in their lives."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Rosado] 
And you've been doing a fantastic job!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Rosado] 
Before, you said folks get so focused on the 
bad that they can't see the good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Rosado] 
I think that's kind of true of you too, Pandreo."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Pandreo] 
I... Huh? What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Rosado] 
You've been looking so hard at the bad that 
you're completely missing the good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Hm!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Pandreo] 
You know what? You're exactly right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Thanks, Rosado! That makes me feel a whole 
lot better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Pandreo] 
From now on, no more doubting myself! 
I'm gonna keep my spirits high!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Rosado] 
Then let's bring the party back tonight! AROO!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, I am SO in! AROOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1

[Pandreo] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Rosado] 
You seem a little glum, Pandreo! Had a little 
too much fun partying?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Yeah... No. I wish that was the only thing 
bothering me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Rosado] 
What's the matter? I'm happy to listen if it'll 
help at all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Pandreo] 
Well, it's not the first time it's happened, and it 
won't be the last."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Pandreo] 
See, some uptight clerics have sent my church 
a formal complaint."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Rosado] 
Ah, right. Your church is a little unusual, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Rosado] 
I've heard you make the whole thing accessible 
with lavish parties and adorable fashions."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Pandreo] 
And putting up big signs with directions to 
the church."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Apparently to serious people, tactics like that 
are ""unbefitting the dignity of the church."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Pandreo] 
I mean, come on! We're pulling in more and 
more new followers every day!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Pandreo] 
They're so focused on the bad that they can't 
see the good. It's infuriating."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Rosado] 
Yeah, that must be frustrating!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Thanks for letting me blow off steam."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Just another day or two in the doldrums and 
I'll be my peppy self again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Rosado] 
I'm sure you will, Pandreo."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Pandreo] 
AR-AROOO! What'd you think of the 
party, Rosado?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Rosado] 
AR-AR-AROOO! Incredible! If it's always this 
fun, I wanna do it every day!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Every day, huh? Even to me, that sounds... 
kinda exhausting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Pandreo] 
I guess it's different for you. You're from the 
village of the fair folk."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Rosado] 
Sure am!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Pandreo] 
I hear people there can go all night long and not 
even have shadows under their eyes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Pandreo] 
I've even heard you can eat and drink to your 
heart's content without getting full."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Pandreo] 
Gotta tell ya, I'm jealous. I wish I could do that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Rosado] 
I'm relieved you're only jealous about it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Huh? What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Rosado] 
Some folks think it's a bit...creepy, actually."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Pandreo] 
Pfft! How ridiculous."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Don't pay any mind to them. They're just too 
proud to admit that they're as jealous as me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Rosado] 
Yeah, I know. Thanks."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Right on. Well, I'll come knocking next time 
there's a party! You best be ready! AROOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Rosado] 
AROOO!"
