Yes, of course. I've been scared from the start

Good. We broke the Fell Dragon Shard. I only 
hope the ""old me"" is going to be OK."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Veyle] 
We were able to provide some healing. The 
""old you"" will awaken soon."

us is starting to change..."
MID_ED1_#009,Now we'll really never see Zephia again.
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
But thanks to her help, we can keep fighting. 
And we will."

You said these invaders were right here. 
And yet, they are not."
MID_ED2_#002,"[Zephia] 
That is very odd... Perhaps the battle 
moved elsewhere."
MID_ED2_#003,"[Sombron] 
I sensed an unexpected Emblem, and wanted to 
see it for myself. But I sense nothing now."
MID_ED2_#004,"[Zephia] 
I'm surprised you came, my lord. It's been some 
time since you ventured outside."
MID_ED2_#005,"[Sombron] 
I had to be certain...though I know that Emblem 
no longer exists."
MID_ED2_#006,"[Zephia] 
Hm?"
MID_ED2_#007,"[Sombron] 
I will go back to the temple. After the battle 
concludes, my child will return with news."
MID_ED2_#008,"[Zephia] 
Your children are endlessly impressive. What I 
wouldn't do to have such loyal subordinates..."
MID_ED2_#009,"[Sombron] 
If you require some of those, then just do what 
I do. Make children."
MID_ED2_#010,"[Zephia] 
Make children...of my own?"
MID_ED2_#011,"[Sombron] 
Family is function and utility. You put blood in. 
You get loyalty out."
MID_ED2_#012,"My children owe me their lives, their love, 
their absolute dedication."
MID_ED2_#013,"[Zephia] 
Family, what a revelation. I would like to 
make one of these children...with you."
MID_ED2_#014,"[Sombron] 
You, have a child with me?"
MID_ED2_#015,"[Zephia] 
Please, Lord Sombron."
MID_ED2_#016,"[Sombron] 
Now is not the time. But I will consider it after 
the war, after my ambitions are served."
MID_ED2_#017,"[Zephia] 
I understand, my lord. I swear to help you 
achieve your ambitions."
MID_ED2_#018,"[Sombron] 
I expect your utmost."
MID_ED2_#019,"[Sombron] 
[Zephia] 
A child, how intriguing..."
MID_ED2_#020,"What would that be like? To possess fully 
through such unconditional love?"
MID_ED2_#021,"How did my mother and father regard me? With 
this...love? If only I could travel to the past."
MID_ED2_#022,"A foolish, impossible thought..."
MID_ED2_#023,"Now, perhaps I should find Lord Sombron's 
child. What was that one called?"
MID_ED2_#024,"Oh, why bother? He disposes of them all. One 
must never, ever grow attached."

I met someone who had my face. But who 
also looked like you."
MID_ED3_#011,"Your blue hair and blue eyes are beautiful. 
The one with my face had...that too."
MID_ED3_#012,"[Lumera] 
That sounds like a lovely dream. Say, it's chilly 
out here. I'd hate for you to catch a cold."

Thank you. This is the first time for this, for me. 
You're being...kind."
MID_ED3_#015,"[Lumera]

name, child?"
MID_ED3_#016,"[Alear] 
Oh, my name... ."
MID_ED3_#017,"Mother told me─this was before she died─that 
Father called me that name. Just once."
MID_ED3_#018,What is your name?
MID_ED3_#019,"[Lumera] 
I'm Lumera."
MID_ED3_#020,"[Alear] 
I know that name. It's the name of the last 
Divine Dragon still alive."
MID_ED3_#021,The name of Father's enemy.
MID_ED3_#022,"[Lumera]

MID_ED3_#023,"[Alear] 
If you are the Divine Dragon, then I have to 
kill you."
MID_ED3_#024,"If I don't, Father will call me a defect and 
dispose of me. But..."
MID_ED3_#025,You were kind to me. I don't want to kill you.
MID_ED3_#026,"[Lumera] 
Oh, ..."
MID_ED3_#027,"[Alear] 
I am thinking a thought that doesn't belong. 
I guess I am what I am. A defect..."
MID_ED3_#028,Defect. Defect. Defect. Defect. Defect.
MID_ED3_#029,"[Lumera] 
Don't say that! There's nothing defective 
about you!"
MID_ED3_#030,"[Alear] 
But I must do my duty...or else Father will 
dispose of me. He'll feed me to the Corrupted."
MID_ED3_#031,That scares me more than anything...
MID_ED3_#032,"I want to live. To see tomorrow. And the day 
after that."
MID_ED3_#033,"[Lumera] 
Then let's keep today between us. I don't want 
you to die."
MID_ED3_#034,"How about this? Let's meet again soon for a 
nice, long, kind talk. No one needs to know."
MID_ED3_#035,What do you say? Pinky promise?

MID_ED4_#003,"[Veyle]

MID_ED4_#004,"Now, we just need to break the last shard."
MID_ED4_#005,"[Timerra]

MID_ED4_#009,"[Veyle]

weird place?"

MID_ED4_#013,"[Veyle] 
Sorry. I'm a little tired. Could I please be alone 
for a bit?"

MID_OP1_#003,"Zephia was telling the truth. It is out there─very 
deep at the bottom of this lake."

that whole submerged area into reach."

Is that what you're trying to do? Break 
the shard?"
MID_OP3_#039,"[Alear] 
What if it was? Would you let us pass by?"
MID_OP3_#040,"[Alear] 
No, that is stupid. I cannot return home without 
your rings."
MID_OP3_#041,"We will fight. If I win, I take your rings."
MID_OP3_#042,"If you win, you break the shard. Simple as that."
MID_OP3_#043,"[Alear] 
Then we can't avoid a fight here."
MID_OP3_#044,"[Alear] 
Stranger with my face, I am ready to battle 
when you are."
MID_OP3_#045,You will fight me...and this Emblem.
MID_OP3_#046,"敵マルス 3 
敵マルス 
..."
MID_OP3_#047,"[Alear] 
Marth?!"
MID_OP3_#048,"[Alear] 3 
[Alear] 
This is my Emblem...now show me yours."
MID_OP3_#049,"[Alear] 
They'd never believe I'm an Emblem..."
MID_OP3_#050,"And it's best to keep that to myself, so... Marth!"
MID_OP3_#051,"[Veyle] 
[Marth] 4 
[Marth] 
I'm here!"
MID_OP3_#052,"[Alear] 
You have a Marth too?"
MID_OP3_#053,"There should be only one of each ring. This is 
more and more interesting."
MID_OP3_#054,"[Alear] 
Everyone, ready yourselves! No matter what, 
we must destroy the shard!"
