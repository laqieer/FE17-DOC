[Céline] 
Louis, I must apologize."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Céline] 
I left without finishing the tea you went to such 
lengths to prepare for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Céline] 
All you endured for the sake of those leaves..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Louis] 
There is no need to apologize, Princess Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Louis] 
It was I who soured your pleasant mood."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Céline] 
Louis... There are many joys in my life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Céline] 
I have always held the way you prepare tea for 
me to be among them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Louis] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Céline] 
It's true that the tea brewed with your special 
leaves brought me more joy than usual."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Céline] 
That said...Louis, understand this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Céline] 
It grieves me that you would put yourself in 
harm's way to bring me that joy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Louis] 
Princess Céline?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Céline] 
All I need is the pleasure of your company while 
drinking tea. Any tea will do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Céline] 
I need no extravagant gestures. That small, 
everyday joy is enough for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Louis] 
Truly, I am chastened."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Louis] 
I see that I have misinterpreted your needs. 
A blunder most unbecoming."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Louis] 
It's a mistake I'll not make again. I swear to you, 
here and now..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Louis] 
I will remain at your side that I might safeguard 
the small joys of your life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Céline] 
Very good. I shall expect nothing less."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Céline] 
Now, if that is settled...might I ask you to put 
on a pot of tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Louis] 
Certainly. I trust you will not mind if I do not 
bring out the special leaves, yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Céline] 
Hahaha, I think that would be best."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Céline] 
Even an ordinary tea is elevated by the 
everyday joy of these small moments."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Céline] 1

[Céline] 
Simply exquisite."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Céline] 
The depth! The fullness of this fragrance! 
I've never had a black tea quite like it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Louis] 
You enjoyed it, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Céline] 
Louis, ""enjoyed"" is an understatement."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Céline] 
I've sipped my share of tea in my life, but rarely 
have I tasted any of this caliber."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Céline] 
I'm extraordinarily grateful to you for 
the privilege."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Louis] 
It pleases me that you are pleased."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Céline] 
Might I trouble you for another cupful?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Louis] 
Of course. I have an ample enough supply of 
leaves to brew another pot."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Céline] 
Thank you. Ahh, what a joy this tea is."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Louis] 
Haha, the bliss on my princess's face makes it 
worth the trouble."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Louis] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Céline] 
Hmm? Is something the matter with your arm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Louis] 
Nothing of note. Just a minor incident on my 
outing to fetch the tea leaves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Céline] 
What happened?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Louis] 
These tea leaves were not farm-grown, alas. 
They arise naturally in the wild."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Louis] 
The path to their native fields is treacherous, 
due to the ferocious beasts who nest there."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Céline] 
One of these beasts attacked you..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Louis] 
Please do not let it trouble you. It is a surface 
wound and nothing more."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Louis] 
I would bear a hundred injuries like it for the 
sake of these precious tea leaves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Louis] 
Now then, that fresh pot is ready for you. 
Your cup, please?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Céline] 
I've lost my taste for it. Good day, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Louis] 
Have I offended?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Céline] 1

[Louis] 
Is the tea to your liking, Princess Céline?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Céline] 
Very much so. I particularly enjoy the aroma."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Céline] 
I smell a hint of citrus along with...floral notes, 
yes? More than one variety, if I'm not mistaken."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Céline] 
It brings to mind the blossoms often found 
during the warmer months."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Céline] 
Taken altogether, the scent is most pleasing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Louis] 
I endeavor to satisfy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Louis] 
This black tea is a mix of leaves from southern 
Firene with dried fruit rinds and flowers."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Céline] 
It's heavenly, as the blends you prepare 
always are."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Céline] 
The chance to sip the tea you brew is one of 
the small joys that gets me through each day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Louis] 
Haha, you're too kind, Princess Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Louis] 
Somewhat related...do you remember the 
special leaves I mentioned recently?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Céline] 
Yes, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Céline] 
You said that they would produce a unique and 
distinctive flavor, if I recall."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Louis] 
You recall correctly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Louis] 
I have a lead on how one might acquire such 
leaves. I take it that would interest you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Céline] 
Truly? You're right. I'd love to sample it 
for myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Louis] 
Excellent. The wait will be worth it."
