[Seadall] 
And a one, two, three, four..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Chloé] 1 
[Chloé] 
I never get tired of watching you dance."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
Checking up on me, Chloé? I'd have set up a 
front-row seat if I'd known you were watching."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Chloé] 
Well, I didn't want to interrupt your practice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Chloé] 
But I brought some new folk food for you to try: 
honey-glazed gecko! It's good for you, I swear."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Seadall] 
It looks...appetizing, as always. But thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Seadall] 
The flavors are good. Unusual, no doubt, but 
I love the sweetness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Chloé] 
Aha! Just as I thought."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Chloé] 
I've brought you enough folk food to figure out 
the secret─you'll eat anything if it's sweet!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Seadall] 
I'm not sure about that..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Chloé] 
You know, you really are a wonderful dancer. 
Very graceful, but with such power."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Chloé] 
Did someone teach you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Seadall] 
Yes. I have a master─the teacher in the caravan. 
He taught me to dance."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Seadall] 
I guess I should say that I ""had"" a master."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Chloé] 
Does that mean..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Seadall] 
He died during a raid on the caravan. He was 
protecting me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Chloé] 
Oh no..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Seadall] 
I never got a chance to repay my debt to him. 
It's the only fate I couldn't foresee."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Chloé] 
But your master's dancing lives on in you, 
doesn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Seadall] 
I hope so. But I have a long way to go before 
I achieve his level of skill."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Seadall] 
Still, I do my best to mesmerize my audience 
through the sublime art of dance."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Chloé] 
I have no doubt you've done that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Seadall] 
Hm-hm. Thank you, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Seadall] 
And now that I've eaten, it's time to dance."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Seadall] 
I was going to give you a special performance as 
a thank-you, but how about we dance together?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Chloé] 
I would love nothing more."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Seadall] 2 
[Chloé] 
Well, Seadall? What do you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
Is this supposed to be...food?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Chloé] 
Of course it is."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Seadall] 
What exactly am I looking at? What are the 
ingredients? How was it prepared?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Chloé] 
It's eggs cooked in sugar."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Seadall] 
Eggs...from what?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Chloé] 
From a rare fish caught in Firene's waters, for 
the most part."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Seadall] 
""For the most part""?! What kind of eggs are 
in here?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Chloé] 
The delicious kind, of course. You've got 
nothing to worry about."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Seadall] 
Oh, I'm worried all right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Seadall] 
But...you went to all this effort to bring food 
to me. It would be rude not to give it a try."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Seadall] 
Ugh, the look...the smell...it's ruining 
my appetite..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Chloé] 
Folk food isn't for everyone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Seadall] 
I'm sorry, Chloé. I don't think it's for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Chloé] 
What a shame. This kind of thing might have 
bold flavors that won't trip up your footwork."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Seadall] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Seadall] 
You found a dish...that's flavorful yet won't 
distract my dancing?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Seadall] 
I spoke too soon. I will eat your folk food."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Chloé] 
That's great! Go ahead and dig in."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Seadall] 
Here we go..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Seadall] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Chloé] 
Still can't stomach it, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Seadall] 
No, it's...actually quite tasty. Bitter and sweet, 
but I like that about it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Chloé] 
Really? What a relief. The flavor's so strong that 
I was worried you couldn't keep it down."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Seadall] 
You wouldn't believe what I ate when I traveled 
with the caravan. I have a strong stomach."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Seadall] 
Maybe sometime you could teach me more 
about these kinds of dishes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Chloé] 
I'd be happy to. And Seadall? Thanks for giving 
it an honest try."

[Seadall] 
Spirit of the cards, cast your divine light so 
that I may see the correct path forward!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Seadall] 
HAAA!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Chloé] 
Seadall! I heard you shouting. What's going on?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Seadall] 
Oh, Chloé. I'm in the middle of a very 
important reading."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Chloé] 
You yell when you're reading?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Seadall] 
Look at this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Seadall] 
Right here, before me...meat sizzling on the fire, 
dripping and juicy. Oh, how tempting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Seadall] 
But my dancing will be less than disciplined if I 
let my passion for savory flavors rule me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Seadall] 
My body is my instrument. I must be vigilant. 
So, here I sit, consulting the cards."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Chloé] 
Hah, sounds like fun."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Chloé] 
Well? What did the cards tell you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Seadall] 
As much as it pains me to say, it appears I'm 
not destined to eat this meat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Chloé] 
More for me, then!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Seadall] 
Moon and stars! I thought you'd protest at 
least a little bit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Seadall] 
Oh well, go ahead. Though must you enjoy it 
so much?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Chloé] 
Thanks for the meal, Seadall. Next time, it'll be 
my treat!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Seadall] 
If you say so. Sounds...delicious."
