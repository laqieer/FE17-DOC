[Alcryst] 
Pardon me, Princess Ivy?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
In our last conversation, you made it clear that 
you still harbor resentment toward Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
Yes. I did."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Well, at the risk of overstepping my boundaries, 
I hope you'll allow me to say one thing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alcryst] 
The relationship between Brodia and Elusia has 
never been civil─certainly not in my lifetime."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alcryst] 
But as you've mentioned, we are now allies... 
We work together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Ivy] 
That's true."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alcryst] 
This alliance was as unpredictable as it 
is wonderful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alcryst] 
I will work hard to ensure that our countries 
become allies when this conflict is over."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alcryst] 
I may not be able to do as much as my brother, 
the crown prince, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Well, I thought I owed you a clear statement of 
my own intentions at the very least."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Ivy] 
My first impression of you was that you were 
weak-willed and uncharismatic."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Ivy] 
I feel differently now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alcryst] 
You do?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Ivy] 
When it matters, you speak your mind. And 
what you say is kind and thoughtful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Ivy] 
These are qualities I consider princely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alcryst] 
Oh, no, please don't think too highly of me. 
You're much more regal and capable than─"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Ivy] 
Are you suggesting that I, crown princess of my 
kingdom, am not a good judge of character?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alcryst] 
N-not at all! I would never, ever..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alcryst] 
Ah. Another joke?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Ivy] 
Very good. You're catching on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alcryst] 
Haha, I take it as a sign that our relationship 
is improving."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Ivy] 
Agreed. I hope our friendship continues to grow."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Ivy] 
In honor of our fathers...and for the future of 
our kingdoms."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alcryst] 
Yes. Here's to a better future!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1

[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Princess Ivy? Are you...glaring at me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Ivy] 
No, Prince Alcryst. At least not intentionally."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Ivy] 
But I can't take my eyes off of your armor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Ivy] 
In Elusia we are taught from an early age to 
keep watch for Brodian armor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alcryst] 
Ooh. I think I understand..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alcryst] 
Brodia has invaded Elusia more times than I can 
count. My country has a lot to answer for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alcryst] 
For what it's worth...I am sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Ivy] 
Oh? And what do you mean by that, exactly?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Huh? I, uh, wha─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Ivy] 
Did you just issue a formal apology from the 
kingdom of Brodia for its invasions of our land?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Ivy] 
Are you admitting fault on behalf of your people 
and swearing to adopt peaceful foreign policy?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Ivy] 
Reconciliation between nations is a serious 
matter, not to be taken lightly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alcryst] 
Th-that's not what I─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alcryst] 
What I meant to say was, uh, if Brodia is at 
fault then we absolutely should apologize."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alcryst] 
But that apology is not mine to give! The king 
and nobility would have to convene and agree..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alcryst] 
So when I said I was sorry, it came from me as 
an individual, not as a representative of...uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Ivy] 
Heh heh, I know that. I'm sorry─you are a little 
too easy to toy with."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Oh, Princess Ivy... I was so nervous."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Ivy] 
My ill feelings toward Brodia are in the past, 
but I could not resist teasing you a little."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Ivy] 
Look on the bright side─we are comfortable 
enough now to joke with one another. Right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alcryst] 
Y-yes, of course! I did think my heart was going 
to stop, but I suppose it was...funny..."

[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Ivy] 
Did you need something from me, 
Prince Alcryst?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Ivy] 
I see. You are pretending to ignore me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alcryst] 
I still refuse to forgive you. You know why."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alcryst] 
How else should I behave in the presence of 
someone who helped to murder my father?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Ivy] 
I apologize for my part in your father's death."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alcryst] 
Y-you do?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Ivy] 
I know an apology can't heal your wounds, or... 
really achieve much at all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Ivy] 
But we are now allies."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Ivy] 
I think it's important we find what common 
ground we can and meet each other halfway."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alcryst] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Ivy] 
That is why I'm taking this crucial first step."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Ivy] 
I am truly sorry about your father."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alcryst] 
Princess Ivy, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alcryst] 
I used to fear your family and your country. 
I never dreamed we'd end up on the same side."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alcryst] 
Life is so unpredictable..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alcryst] 
It pushes us forward, ready or not. Holding on 
to past prejudices will only trip us up."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Alcryst] 
From now on, I promise to do my best to find 
that common ground you mentioned."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Ivy] 
Thank you. But you should know that staring 
is rude."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Alcryst] 
Ah! You're right! I apologize for being so 
careless. I won't let it happen again."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Alcryst] 

[Ivy] 
At least we're looking in the same direction. 
Perhaps better times lie ahead..."
