[Lapis] 
Hello, Goldmary! I made lunch. Hope you 
brought an appetite."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Goldmary] 
Mmm, these look delicious. What are they?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
They're yam dumplings, made with yams from 
my village. Go on─eat up!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Goldmary] 
I've never heard of them before. I hope they 
taste as good as they look."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Goldmary] 
Mmm... My goodness!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Goldmary] 
They're wonderful! I didn't expect them to be 
so intensely sweet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lapis] 
That's all from the yams. I didn't use sugar."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Goldmary] 
I hope you don't mind if I help myself to 
the rest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lapis] 
By all means! I'm sure my parents would be 
glad you're enjoying their yams so much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Goldmary] 
Are they farmers?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lapis] 
Mm-hmm. The land is infertile, though, so 
they're pretty poor."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Lapis] 
And bears are always roaming around, so we'd 
have to hunt them down and eat them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Goldmary] 
That explains how you came to know so much 
about handling that bear situation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lapis] 
I learned a lot from dealing with those bears. 
Above all, I learned how to fight."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Lapis] 
Then I entered Brodia's fighting tourney─my 
ticket out of poverty."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lapis] 
By winning the tourney, I earned a spot as 
Prince Alcryst's retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Lapis] 
So you might say I have bears to thank for 
my success."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lapis] 
No one in the tourney held a candle to them, 
after all!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Goldmary] 
Hehe, they do set a high bar."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Lapis] 
And now, you might say I have those bears to 
thank for my friendship with you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Goldmary] 
You're right. And I'm very glad for that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Goldmary] 
I don't often let my guard down around people, 
but...I feel like I can be myself around you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Goldmary] 
If it's all right, I'd like it if we could spend time 
together more often."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lapis] 
I'd love that!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Goldmary] 
Great! You and I can chat about all the aspects 
of village life the big city folks can't understand."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Lapis] 
Hehe, sounds like a plan!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Lapis] 
It's nice to have a friend from the country─ 
even if it's a different country's country."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Thank you so much for all your help, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
My parents wrote to let me know that the bears 
have stopped giving them trouble."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lapis] 
That's great! What a relief."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Goldmary] 
They sent this along to thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lapis] 
Huh? Wait a second. Is this..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Goldmary] 
An invitation to relax and enjoy your stay at my 
family's inn─as soon as the war is over."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Goldmary] 
I may be biased, but I really do think you'll find 
our hot springs to be the finest in the world."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lapis] 
Wow, that sounds like such a treat! Thanks!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lapis] 
I have to say, Goldmary, I'm surprised you're 
from a little village. You're so sophisticated."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Goldmary] 
Oh, don't be silly. You're right, though. Go on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Lapis] 
Let me guess. You were born in a rural area 
and then raised in the big city?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Goldmary] 
No, I lived in my home village until just a few 
years ago."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Goldmary] 
I was there right until I had to leave for the 
academy, actually."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Lapis] 
Huh. Your village must be way different 
than mine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Goldmary] 
I'd be curious to hear about the differences."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lapis] 
Sure thing. Next time we talk, I'll tell you all 
about where I grew up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Lapis] 
I'll even make us lunch! I know just the thing to 
whip up for the occasion."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Goldmary] 
Wonderful! Usually I'm the one making the food, 
so this will be a nice change of pace."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Goldmary] 
I'm looking forward to spending more time 
with you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Oh no... What am I going to do?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
What's wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Well... My parents run an inn beside the finest 
hot springs in Elusia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if that makes you jealous. I can't help 
that I grew up an only child in the lap of luxury."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lapis] 
Uh, wow! Sounds lovely!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Goldmary] 
Yes, but...my parents have just informed me 
that the inn is having trouble with bears."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lapis] 
Bears, huh? Ugh, they can be tricky to 
deal with."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Lapis] 
There's no time to lose. We'd better write up a 
letter telling your parents what to do."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Goldmary] 
But I don't know anything about bears."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Goldmary] 
I have so many talents, but dealing with 
terrifying predators isn't one of them..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Lapis] 
Leave it to me. I'm from a village where we deal 
with them all the time, so I know my stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Goldmary] 
Really?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Lapis] 
Here's an example. Let's say you find a bear 
eating your crops."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lapis] 
So you say, ""HEY! Get outta here, fur face, or 
you're in for a world of hurt!"""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Lapis] 
The bear will be like, ""Oh, sure thing,"" and have 
lunch elsewhere."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Goldmary] 
Wow..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Lapis] 
Seriously! I'm speaking from experience here. 
I've done it dozens of times."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Goldmary] 
All right, you're the expert. I trust you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Lapis] 
I know lots of bear-management methods, from 
intimidation to good old-fashioned combat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Goldmary] 
Please teach me everything you know."
