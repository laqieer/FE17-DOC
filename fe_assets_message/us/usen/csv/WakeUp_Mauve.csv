MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,"Heh, you really are siblings with Lady Veyle, 
aren't you?"
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,"Your face when asleep, how you awaken..."
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004,You look just like her.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,"This is the complete opposite of the altar 
Lady Veyle slept upon."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,I shall tell you of it.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,"That altar was always dark, as if shrouded in an 
endless night."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,"I was used to it, that darkness, but..."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004,this place is not bad either.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,I admit to missing it sometimes...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,"Her altar, hidden in a dark forest..."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,"Lady Veyle lay there, serenely..."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004,just like you.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,Oh. You heard me speak just now.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,"Do you think Queen Lumera would approve 
of my presence?"
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,I see.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004,Yes...I believe you.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,"Let us help people again today, Divine One."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,I just realized something.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,"That you allowed me into this room right 
from the very beginning."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,It shows you have trusted me...
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004,all this time.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,I wonder what Queen Lumera would think...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,about my setting foot in here.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,Or that I would be the one to wake her child...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,I am sorry to have disturbed your sleep.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,It was selfish of me. Yet I am glad...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,Glad you heard regrets that remain with me still.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004,I feel as if a part of me was saved.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,This seems a wonderful place for prayer.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,Pardon me.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,"May I please enter your room a bit later 
this evening?"
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,I would like to pray at this altar...
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004,for my fallen companion.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,I wonder if she can hear me from this place.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,"Please, hear my prayers...Marni."
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,I am sorry I let you die.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004,"I am sorry I never told you how special 
you were."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,Oh! Good morning!
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,"No, no─there is no particular problem."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,I will head into town now...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004,to atone for my wrongdoings. Goodbye.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,"I have my duty to wake the Divine Dragon, 
the same as everyone does."
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,"I do not know if this is the right time to say 
it, but..."
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,"I am still very happy about the time you called 
me a good person."
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,"Goodbye, now."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Hm, this thin cloth around the altar blocks 
my way..."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,Ugh... I'm caught in it!
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,I must be sure not to tear it. Careful... Careful...
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,"Ah, you are awake."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,"Lady Veyle had previously fallen into deep 
slumbers herself..."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,so I was rather concerned.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004,I'm grateful all is well.
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,The duties of this army are quite something.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,I have fulfilled the task of waking you...
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003,so I shall take my leave now.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Divine One. It is morning. Wake up, 
if you please."
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,Why don't you wake?
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,Curious. Is something wrong?
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,You were awake!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,I hope I didn't disturb...
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,I was wrong to make such noise while you slept.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004,"In any case, I will go now. Farewell."
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,"This is a very bright altar. Too bright, really, 
but quite beautiful."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,"You are awake, Divine One."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,"Lady Veyle was just saying that she wished 
to meet with you."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,I will take my leave.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,If I had remained one of the Four Hounds...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,I would never have come here.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,I would never have seen this sight...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004,I may not even have survived...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,"Oh, you are awake."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,"You say I should not be so humble, but..."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,Allow me to be forward with you just this once.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004,"I speak plainly, not to the Divine Dragon, 
but to someone precious to me."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,"I have come to wake you, my partner."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,I will protect you today as always.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,My loyalty has been given to my lady...
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004,but my heart is yours alone.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,When I'm here...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,"I know what it is to think dearly of someone. 
Something I thought I would never experience."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,"Of course, Lady Veyle remains my liege..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,"but my partner, the one who truly lives in my 
heart, is you and only you."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,When I look upon you as you lie on this altar...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,"I swear upon this ring that I will protect you 
until my last breath."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,I feel so close to you...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,Especially this morning.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,"I adore you, Divine One."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005,"Once, that would have been embarrassing for 
me to say aloud."
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,I no longer feel awkward...
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002,when I enter this room.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,It is so gratifying...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,"to be here when you wake, as your first sight 
each day."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,"I am so happy, Divine One. Thank you..."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,for helping me learn I could feel this way.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Now it is time to wake up. Heh, when we are 
here, together like this..."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,"I can almost forget that we are in the middle 
of a war."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,When peace returns again...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,"I wonder if I will have the chance to live with 
you, Divine One."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,"It is an innocent dream for someone such as 
myself, but..."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,You taught me to believe in impossible ideas.
