[Sigurd] 2 
[Alfred] 
My father died in an epidemic when I was little. 
Both he and I were frail─I was lucky to survive."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I grieve for your father, leaving behind a young 
child. I know the feeling all too well."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
It made me want to get tough, though! I have a 
weak body, but a strong will to improve it."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Then I see no upper bound to what strength 
you may achieve. You shall surpass your father!"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
My sister thought me reckless for bolting into 
battle for the sake of my friends. What say you?"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
My sister's always calling me a barbarian for 
the same reason. A good jog puts it behind me."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Alfred] 
I visited the Divine Dragon lots of times over the 
years. We're practically family."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
A persistent presence can form bonds deeper 
even than blood. They are to be cherished."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Anna] 
Hey, Sigurd! Do you know what holiday it is?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Is it a holiday? I suppose my ignorance is 
obvious. None spring to mind, at any rate."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Anna] 
Don't feel bad. I just made it up! Today is 
officially ""Anna-Sigurd Friendship Day."""
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Oh? That has a nice ring to it. I shall remember 
to celebrate each time the day arrives."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
Having seen more of your performance in battle, 
I admit my prior mistake. You are a staunch ally."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Anna] 
I'm pretty good, huh? Glad you noticed. With 
that out of the way, wanna see what's for sale?"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I must say, Anna, I balk at the notion of 
allowing one so young on the battlefield."
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Anna] 
Relax! I can handle it. And we're way too close 
for you to call me anything but Lady Anna."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
Am I to understand your family restaurant was 
destroyed by bandits, and your parents killed?"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
That's correct. I swear I will rebuild it for them 
and for Fogado, who made me his retainer."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
I'm here because he and others supported me. 
I perfect my cuisine and combat skills for them."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
That is most noble. I am certain your parents 
would be proud to see you carry on their dream."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Bunet] 
Have you ever felt regret after a battle? The 
wind tastes and smells bitter to me after a fight."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I am well familiar with regret. Solace is found in 
remembering why I fought, and for whom."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Bunet] 
I can imagine you as a splendid ingredient, 
Sigurd. Something akin to seafood, perhaps."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I am...honored? Yet I wonder why you think so. 
Perhaps it is because of my colors?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Is it true you have a son, Sigurd? I bet he's 
an outstanding knight."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Indeed, he was a glorious knight. After my 
death, alas."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Oh! I...I didn't know that. I'm very sorry to 
hear it."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Worry not. The bond between he and I endures 
beyond time and space. He is his father's son."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Huh? Is this back where I started? How do I get 
out of here?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I did wonder if you lost your way. Come, I shall 
guide you. I had wanted a conversation partner."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
Let us take up arms to defend the people. It is 
by our bonds that we shall change the world."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
""Bond"" is a good, strong word. I could get used 
to having an Emblem on my side."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Céline] 
I would go to any lengths necessary for my 
nation. A royal's duty is nothing less."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
A royal has many duties. You must consider 
carefully which is most important."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
Align yourself with your people and their needs, 
or you may begin an endless cycle of hatred."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Céline] 
Thank you for that perspective, Sigurd. Your 
hard-won experience is invaluable."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I have little doubt your father would rejoice to 
see what a fine royal you have grown into."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Céline] 
I work hard in honor of his memory. Even after 
the war, my nation will need careful tending."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Céline] 
It is an honor to speak to you, Emblem Sigurd. 
Might I invite you to tea?"
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
That would be a delight. I am no longer able to 
drink the tea. Still, your stories would enchant."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Chloé] 
You're taking breaks now and then, right, 
Sigurd? Even Emblems need rest...I think."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Hm. My yearlong stay in Silesse was the last 
time I felt truly at peace."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
That long, huh? Why don't you rest a minute? 
I'm told my shoulder is an excellent pillow."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
I must decline, due to my incorporeal nature. 
Perhaps I may tell you a story instead."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Chloé] 
Sigurd, look! I found some extra-special folk 
food made from dried and fermented fish."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
The smell is...overwhelming. This is food, you 
say? It must be an acquired taste indeed."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Chloé] 
I'm so excited to fight alongside you, Sir Sigurd. 
You're like a knight right out of a fairy tale!"
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I am no storybook hero. Only a man who fights 
for the people. Something we both believe in."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I have to thank you, Sigurd. Your power helps 
me protect those I love...and I love so, so many."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Your time among our allies has formed lasting 
connections─some even stronger than blood."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
You're right. I do feel connected to everyone. 
And that goes for you too."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Indeed! Bonds forged through battle are even 
stronger...and ours will last far into the future."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I love Brodia, and Brodia has loved me in return. 
Its people, its land... Its everything."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Hold on to that love, Citrinne. Let it guide you 
in protecting your kingdom...and your people."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Citrinne] 
It's wonderful to meet you, Sigurd. May I offer 
you some cake? I just bought a whole bakery!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I cannot possibly eat that much cake─or any 
cake at all, actually. Still, I appreciate the offer."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Clanne] 
I want to help the Divine Dragon, so I should be 
strong. How do I get strong, Lord Sigurd?"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
A knight's duty is to aid their people. That alone 
was the inspiration I needed to train daily."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
Yet it is not enough, strength. Compassion must 
be a regular practice as well. Study the heart."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
The heart... Huh. OK. Thank you, Lord Sigurd. 
I'm going to think about this."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Clanne] 
I talked to the Divine Dragon so much today! 
Lord Sigurd, I'm so happy I could faint."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Fainting during conversation? Some would think 
that rude. Strive to remain upright, Clanne."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
You rather admire the Divine Dragon, do you 
not, Clanne?"
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Yeah! I waited so long for the Divine Dragon to 
wake up. It's like I'm living in a dream!"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Diamant] 
When this war is over, Sigurd, I hope you'll join 
us in Brodia. I could learn so much from you."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
A high compliment from a man with your skills... 
Still, the Dragon Divine must approve."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
No matter what, you and I now share a deep 
bond. Near or far, that bond will never break."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Diamant] 
Well said, Sigurd. With your help, I will see this 
battle through to the end."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Diamant] 
Sigurd... I struggle with magic. I'm held back by 
a painful childhood memory that involved Fire."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Curious. I carry a painful memory that involves 
fire as well... I will never forget that terrible day."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Diamant] 
It's an honor to fight alongside you, Sigurd. I've 
heard you're a hero who faced great hardships."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
This is true─yet my friends helped me achieve 
much in my time. They were heroes as well."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Etie] 
Out of all my siblings, my parents were strictest 
with me. I used to worry they hated me."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
They expected much because they saw much 
potential. You learned discipline from this, yes?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Etie] 
Well, they gave me a body to run with, and 
running is how I ease my mind. So there's that."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Naturally, parents wish to protect their children. 
The reasons may elude the child, however."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Etie] 
Do you like tea, Sigurd? And if you do, want to 
go have a cup with me?"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
When you offer, how can I decline? I cannot 
partake of the tea, yet I will savor the company."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Etie] 
Hey, Sigurd. Having a nice day? I sure am, 
after my jog just now."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Ah, that would explain why you are the way 
you are. Uh...I mean only that you are well-built."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I prefer to leave politics to politicians. And on 
the battlefield, I rely on well-versed strategists."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Fogado] 
Yeah, I hear you. We all have different strengths, 
right? I myself make an excellent Sentinel."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
You gotta find folks who make up for the skills 
you lack. That's how you build a good team."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Agreed. And I shall sharpen my skills and wield 
them mightily wherever we go, Fogado."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Fogado] 
You'd never leave someone who was in trouble, 
would you? The same goes for me, you know?"
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
The duty of a knight is to protect their people 
above all else. I am pleased you feel equally so."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Fogado] 
I'm about to throw an epic feast. Nothin' stuffy, 
just good times 'n' good friends. You in, Sigurd?"
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Thank you, Fogado, I would be happy to attend. 
I am eager to socialize with my compatriots."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Framme] 
I'm writing a letter to my family back home. 
I miss them so much."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I never received a letter from my child, although 
it would have pleased me greatly if I had."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Framme] 
Aww, that's sad. Lord Sigurd, would it be OK 
if I wrote you a letter sometime?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
That is very kind of you, Framme. Receiving a 
letter from you would please me immensely."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Framme] 
I decorated the Divine One's bedchamber once. 
It looked so good! But Vander got mad at me."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Surely your intentions were respectful. Doing an 
extra kindness like that is commendable."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
Lumera spoke highly of you. She said you 
moved to the Somniel at her personal request."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Framme] 
Queen Lumera mentioned me?! I'm so honored! 
I promise I won't fail her or you, Lord Sigurd."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
After all that has transpired, Goldmary, I have 
come to deeply cherish your friendship."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I see. So not even Emblems are immune to my 
stunning charm."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
You are indeed graceful and highly skilled in 
battle. It is a pleasure to have you as an ally."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Goldmary] 
Of course. I'm sorry if the standard set by my 
talent is unfair to all your other friends."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Befriending Hortensia at the academy in Elusia 
was perhaps my life's greatest turning point."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I, too, met my dearest friends at an academy. 
Our bonds carried us through a great deal."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
Please continue to help us fight the Fell Dragon, 
Goldmary. The people of this world need you."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Goldmary] 
With a sweet entreaty like that, how could 
I possibly refuse?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Hortensia] 
I will do whatever it takes to bring Elusia back 
to its former glory. Consider it an oath."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Your father would be proud to see you swear it. 
And he would be confident of your success."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Thanks. I'd like to ask for your help too, Sigurd. 
But I guess that's up to the Divine Dragon."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Indeed. But wherever our paths may take us, 
I will always think of you as a friend."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Hortensia] 
You're so dignified and gallant. I'll bet you were 
a charmer back in your world."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I thought little of such things. There was only 
ever one woman I was interested in charming."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
My deepest condolences for your father. To see 
any child bereft of a parent fills me with grief."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Hortensia] 
Thank you, Sigurd, but it's OK. I'm grown-up 
enough to keep focused on rebuilding Elusia."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
We know each other rather well by now, and 
yet I do not think I have ever seen you happy."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Ivy] 
Happiness and duty are often mutually 
exclusive for a princess."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
When I was a mere student at the academy, 
I had many joyful experiences among friends."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Then I shall endeavor to be a friend to you, 
that you might someday recapture that joy."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Ivy] 
Though I may not say so as a princess of Elusia, 
I worship the Divine Dragon in my personal life."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
This may be my first glimpse of your true self. 
I must say, I like what I see."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I regret that we could not save your father. 
The pain of a grieving child is... I know it well."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Ivy] 
You need not concern yourself. I am the crown 
princess of Elusia. I know my duty."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Jade] 
Sigurd? Would you mind if I wrote a story about 
your life? I'd like to capture your experiences."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
You wish to put me in a novel? There are many 
figures with tales much happier than mine..."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Jade] 
That may be true...but I'd still like to write 
yours in particular. If you'll allow it, that is."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Very well. We must spend much time together 
so I can best tell you my story."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
Who placed this armor here, upright and alone... 
Ah! Jade! I failed to see you in there somehow."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Jade] 
Sorry, Sigurd. I was just meditating. Heh, I will 
admit, your reaction was very satisfying."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Jade] 
I swear to uphold my honor at your call, Sigurd. 
When you need an iron wall, I will be there."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Thank you, Jade. Let us join together to protect 
our allies in the fashion of true knights."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Jean] 
What made you become a knight, Sigurd? 
Was your father one too?"
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
My lineage was a factor, yes. More than that, I 
wished to use my might to protect the people."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Jean] 
Yeah, that makes sense. I want to help people 
too. Medicine is my way of doing that."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
You have a heart noble as any knight. Let us 
swear together to watch over our countrymen."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Jean] 
My father is the only doctor on our island. 
I want to follow in his footsteps."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
He must be proud to know his legacy will 
endure. But do not be so quick to grow up..."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
War is a cruel thing. Should one so young as 
you be exposed to its horrors?"
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Jean] 
Young or old, it'll touch all our lives anyway. 
I can make a stand, so I will."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
You have such admirable strength. Will you 
come show it to my homeland after this war?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Where I journey next is up to the Divine One, 
but I would be happy to teach you my skills."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
I understand and happily accept your offer. 
I have dreamed of studying your technique!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Then it will be my pleasure to teach you 
everything I know."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
I did not wish to live all my life seeing only my 
own country. That is why I fled my homeland."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Do you write to your parents, at least? Surely 
they would appreciate it. They must worry."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Sigurd! I trust you are well? It is important to 
me that all my friends are healthy and happy."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I am quite well, but thank you for the concern. 
I intend to hold fast until this war is won."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I lost my most important battle, and left my son 
Seliph behind. I had so much to teach him..."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Lapis] 
That sounds so hard─for you and for your son. 
War causes so much pain and suffering..."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
Any battle might be your last. If you have words 
to share with someone, never hesitate to do so."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
Yeah... You might not get another chance, huh? 
Thank you, Sigurd. That's an important lesson."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Lapis] 
Mmm, nothing beats a potato from home... Ah! 
Sigurd! Did you...catch all of that?"
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Why such a panic, Lapis? By all means, feast! 
One cannot win a battle on an empty stomach."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Lapis] 
You're a prince and a knight, right, Sigurd? And 
I'm just a lowly commoner. Oh, I'm so nervous..."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
It matters not from whence you hail, Lapis. 
We are united by our cause."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Lindon] 
I haven't seen my children much since retiring. 
It's a lonely life, but what can you do?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
The prospect of seeing them when peace has 
been restored is one more reason to fight."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
And a reason to stay alive, as well. Our time is 
short, and we must seize all of it that we can."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Lindon] 
You have suffered greatly, Sigurd. I can see it in 
your eyes. May we fight to our very last."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Lindon] 
My wife was a beauty beyond compare. I can 
prove it too! Have a look at this portrait."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
She is truly marvelous to behold. Ah, my 
own wife was lovely and kind as well."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Lindon] 
Got a moment, Sigurd? I'm about to start an 
exciting experiment, if you'd care to participate."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I admit to some curiosity about scholarly 
pursuits such as yours. By all means, show me."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Louis] 
Did you know that I once made a living selling 
my home's famous grape drinks and candies?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Ah, the fruit of the vine. I once enjoyed it 
myself, sharing dreams with my close friends..."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Louis] 
I would love to join you in revelry sometime. 
There is so much I wish to ask, Sir Sigurd."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
It might be pleasant to dredge up a memory or 
two with you. I accept your invitation, Louis."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Louis] 
I've learned a great deal by observing you, 
Sigurd. I hope to become just as great a knight."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Knights must fight on behalf of their people. 
Let us support each other to keep them safe."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
You are a natural people pleaser, are you not? 
I could stand to learn that kindness from you."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Louis] 
I simply enjoy being of service. It makes me 
happy to be present while others interact."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
You have fostered close friendships among 
your allies. That, in turn, led to my presence."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Alear] 
I couldn't have made it this far without all the 
others who walked beside me."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Alear] 
That includes you, Sigurd. I'm so grateful that 
you've been such an ally to us all."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Our bonds will persist even unto the far future. 
We shall end this fight united."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
You are as family to me. We shall walk the same 
path and fight the same battles."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Alear] 
I feel safer with you on my side. In every battle, 
I can feel our hearts beating in sync."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I am thrilled to be your compatriot. I swore to 
Lumera that I would defend you with my life."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Emblem Sigurd. I'm...I'm glad to 
have you on my team too."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Marni's death must be avenged. As it stands, 
her soul may never find rest..."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
This vicious cycle you propose... I am afraid 
sadness is its only reward."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
Grief is worthy of introspection. Accept the pain 
of it, and your truest enemy will be felled."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
Your words strike my heart, Sir Sigurd. I shall 
hold them there as I try to find my way."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Mauvier] 
I was an orphan in the church in Elyos. So, I saw 
something of myself in Veyle."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
And so a bond was formed between Veyle and 
yourself, and a friendship grew. What a blessing."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Mauvier] 
You accept me although I once served the Fell 
Dragon. Thank you for such unearned respect."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Your shame has no value in this world. I choose 
to fight alongside you because you are worthy."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Merrin] 
All I ever wanted to be was a knight, but it was 
my princess who made that dream a reality."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Merrin] 
She asked me once if that's what I truly wanted. 
I nodded and have been in her service since."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
Timerra must have seen something in you and 
known you were meant for the job."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
You must match these expectations. So we shall 
fight side by side, as knights, for all to see."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Merrin] 
Sir Sigurd, please tell me... What should I do to 
become a knight as impressive as you?"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
It is the duty of a knight to protect their people. 
Keep this fire lit in your heart always."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
You have stared at me for some time now. 
If there is something to say, be out with it."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Merrin] 
I'm sorry, I was just observing how you move. 
Sir Sigurd, you are the epitome of cool."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I envy the royal family of Solm. You seem so 
close-knit. Alas, my family was taken from me."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
Oh, that's so sad, Sigurd. I can't imagine not 
being able to see my family."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
I know it's not the same, but I hope you'll think 
of us as your family now."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Thank you, Timerra. That warms my heart. 
I shall never forget the bonds between us."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
My younger sister thinks me quite slovenly. 
I have tried to improve myself, alas..."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Timerra] 
If anything, you're too uptight. My dad traipses 
around the queendom without a worry. Try it!"
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Timerra] 
Having you here is the best, Sigurd. I'd say 
this calls for one of my ♪signature soooongs!♪"
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Ahem, that is a most...how to put this...unique 
way of welcoming me. Truly one of a kind."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lord Sigurd, what kind of battles have you been 
in? I'd love to hear some of your war stories."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I fought for my people and died for my effort. 
But my son and his friends saved our world."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
The bonds we forged then gave us strength. 
And so it is now. We are powerful together."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
We have forged powerful bonds of our own, 
haven't we? Yeah, we'll win this fight together!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Pandreo] 
I thought you'd be more...rigid, since you're a 
holy knight and all, you know? But you're not."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
More rigid? Yes, well, my little sister used 
to chastise me for being quite slovenly."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Pandreo] 
You've known the Divine One for a long time, 
right? I'm so glad you're here to fight for us."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I am simply protecting those who need it the 
most. And right now, this world is in great need."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I misunderstood you at first, Panette. I see now 
that your intentions are quite genuine."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Panette] 
What do you mean by this? Be warned, flattery 
will get you nowhere."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
I meant that you do not have to try to impress 
me. You need only be yourself."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Panette] 
I-I am not trying to impress you. I simply treat 
you like a kindly elder brother who I admire."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Panette] 
When I am unhappy, I find that a ride on my 
wolf clears my head. Care to join me sometime?"
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Ride a wolf? How intriguing. Were I to possess 
a physical body, I would most like to join you."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Panette] 
It is a great privilege to meet the esteemed 
knight Sir Sigurd. I do hope I may be of service."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Esteemed? No need for such formality. I am 
among equals. We fight together!"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I grieve the lost chance of sitting for a portrait 
with my family. A picture can mean so much."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Rosado] 
It's nice to have a keepsake, sure. But either 
way, you'll always have your memories."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
True. With no portrait to leave my son, I can 
only trust that the memory of me will endure."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Rosado] 
I'll bet that's much more precious to your family 
than a picture could ever be."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I hear you risked your life to return a ring to the 
Divine Dragon. What a brave and selfless act."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Rosado] 
I'm glad I was able to help...and that we all 
got out of there."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Rosado] 
Hold still a second, Sigurd. I'm gonna draw you. 
Give me a nice big smile, OK? Perfect."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Astonishing! How do you draw with such 
accuracy and speed?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Saphir] 
My parents would have loved to see me become 
a knight. Elusian soldiers took that from them."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
To leave a child behind is the greatest pain 
a parent can know. I speak from experience."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
It's been a long road, and I only made it this far 
thanks to them. I wish I could tell them that."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
By realizing your dream, you are carrying on 
their legacy. That is all the thanks they need."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Saphir] 
After seeing what you can do, I get why they 
call you the holy knight. Consider me convinced."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
It was not my effort alone that earned the title. 
Without allies by my side, I would have nothing."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Saphir] 
As a royal soldier, there's no higher honor than 
to fight side by side with a knight like you."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
The honor is mine, Saphir. Let us work 
together to bring peace to this world."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Seadall] 
I have two fathers─my blood father and the one 
who raised me. But both are dead now."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Losing parents...is difficult. It pains me deeply 
to imagine how a child feels after such a thing."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
The father who raised me─my master─died 
saving me from bandits. You remind me of him."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Sacrificing himself for you... I have no doubt 
your master cared for you as he would a son."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Seadall] 
Tell me about the world you lived in. I love 
to hear about far off places I've never been."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
My world was filled with conflict and war. Still, 
it was a world worth protecting with my life."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I understand you guarded an Emblem Ring for 
us. I thank you for looking after my friends."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Seadall] 
This praise will go to my head if you're not 
careful. But truly, I am glad I could do my part."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
You have a natural talent for spotting the best 
qualities in others. I hope you recognize that."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
I wouldn't say I'm talented at it... It's just a 
simple fact that everyone is better than I am."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
Haha, so certain! I hope you manage to turn 
that keen eye toward yourself someday, Alcryst."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Thank you, Lord Sigurd. I can't promise that 
will happen, but...I'll try."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
You may not have realized this, Alcryst, but you 
are loved. Your kindness invites such fondness."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Oh... I'm not worthy of your words. Th-thank 
you so much, Lord Sigurd... It's an honor."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Aah! Forgive me, Lord Sigurd! I wanted to say 
hello, but I'm not worthy of your time, and yet..."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
No need for concern, Alcryst. I am just another 
ally of the Dragon Divine like you."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I was slain in battle with my dreams unfulfilled... 
Fortunately, my son finished what I began."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Amber] 
Whoa... I hope I can fight as well as your son. 
I want to become a true alpaca-hamlet miracle!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
Haha... It must be wonderful to see one's child 
grow into a hero. Pursue your passions, Amber!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Amber] 
I will! I have a lot to learn from you, Sigurd. 
I hope you'll stick around."
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
I hear you are the son of a farmer. You must 
have worked hard to ascend to knighthood."
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Kinda! I did a lot of horseback training. I wish it 
had been alpacaback...but they're too small!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Amber] 
You're a holy knight, right, Sigurd? Man, that 
is so cool! I can't believe I get to talk to you!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I am touched by your enthusiasm, Amber. 
Still, we are friends now. You may relax. Please."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
""An outstanding Steward of the Dragon,"" that 
is what Lumera said of you. Did you know?"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
It was my privilege to serve the queen. Though 
I assumed it would be she who would bury me."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Vander] 
I admired Queen Lumera. It was a true joy to 
have served as her attendant for so long."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
And she, I am sure, was happy to have you. 
Now, together, let us continue her work."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
What handicraft you display. The ability to knit 
such an elaborate lace must be uncommon, no?"
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Vander] 
I suppose I have developed some skill at the art. 
In truth, it is only a hobby I enjoy in idle hours."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Vander] 
It pains me so that I was unable to protect 
Queen Lumera. I am ill with the guilt of it."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Gone she may be, but the will of Lumera lives 
on. Bringing her wishes to fruition is our duty."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Veyle] 
We've been in many battles together, Sigurd. 
So, I wonder...can I request something of you?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
You are someone who knows and understands 
the grief of others. How could I refuse?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
Thank you. But what I want to ask is...would 
you consider being my friend?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
Gladly, Veyle. More than gladly. And I promise, 
our bond of friendship shall remain for eternity."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
You are smiling more often, I see. Bonding with 
friends is a good way to banish fears."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Veyle] 
Yes, it is. And having you here to fight beside us 
makes me less afraid too. Thank you, Sigurd."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Veyle] 
Sigurd, I'm so sorry I made you fight the Divine 
One. It was a terrible thing to do."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
No one here blames you, most certainly not me. 
You are a precious friend. Never forget that."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Yunaka] 
I learned to survive from a guy I used to work 
for. I had no say in it, but I guess I'm grateful."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Important lessons to learn, from the sound of it. 
Did you rise to the standard of your teacher?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
Rose to and exceeded, just like he planned. 
He was the closest I ever had to a father."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Sigurd] 
I am sure he was proud of you in that moment, 
as any parent would be."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Say, Sigurd. Would you mind giving me a teensy 
peek at your priceless treasure of a weapon?!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
Sharp eye─this sword is indeed a treasured 
heirloom, passed down to me by my father."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Zappy! How goes it, Sigurd? Ready to face 
the day? Show the world who's boss?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I have not the faintest idea what you mean, but 
I am in fine spirits, if that is your question."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
My son, Seliph, fought to avenge my death, but 
our foe considered his own actions to be just."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 
I often wonder if it is the *same* with the man 
who killed my father."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Sigurd] 
Moral truth is not simple or objective. We each 
have our own view of what is right and wrong."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Zelkov] 
Your empathy is *humbling.* I see now why 
they call you the holy knight."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Zelkov] 
As an Emblem, you do not age. Does the 
prospect of such long life not *frighten* you?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Sigurd] 
I do not fear a long life. But knowing I must bid 
farewell to so many I care for does unsettle me."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
No need to keep busy at all times, Zelkov. 
Why not take rest where you can find it?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
I find no peace in the idleness you call rest. 
I prefer to *remain* occupied."
