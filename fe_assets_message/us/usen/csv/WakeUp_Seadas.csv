MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,Good evening.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,"Now, make a wish."
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,It may come true.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004,"Did you know, saying a wish out loud pulls it 
toward you?"
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#005,You see? A shooting star just sailed by.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,"Divine One, you should see the sky tonight. 
It's breathtaking."
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002,"Come, let's read the stars together."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,"Ah, you're taking me up on my offer."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,"The view of the stars from the altar... 
It defies words..."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,and pulls one's thoughts...
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004,"far, far away."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,Or are you lost in dreams?
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,I wonder...what do you dream about.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,I often dream about the desert's moonlit sky.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004,"Hah, even in my dreams, all I do is gaze at 
the stars."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,"You're awake, are you?"
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,"Can you sense how happy I am? Can you see 
the beauty inside?"
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,What I hope you see...
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004,is a better me.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,"Today I dance with a full stomach and, 
more importantly, a full soul."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,"Ah, good morning."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,What do you say...
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,we start the day with a dance?
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004,"Please, Divine One..."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#005,share this joy with me.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,My breakfast was quite savory.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,A joyful fuel indeed.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,"Thank you, Divine One."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004,You've helped me change.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,"Divine One, I could dance for you."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,"Here, tonight. If you'd like."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,I could perform my master's dance.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004,And share its profound beauty.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,"Yes, this place...it's perfect for dancing."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,"Ah, did I wake you?"
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,"I'm sorry. I was just looking for somewhere 
to practice."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,This altar...
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004,Surely it was made with dance rituals in mind.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,I'm sure many dancers performed for you here.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,If only you could have seen my master dance.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,He was beauty in motion.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,I'm sorry.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,It's so late and yet here I am.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,I thought perhaps...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004,you'd have words of wisdom for me...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#005,as you often do.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,"Spirit of the cards, moon and stars above..."
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002,"please, tell me, would a midnight snack provide 
proper fuel for my dance?!"
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,"Ah, forgive me, Divine One."
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,"My fortune telling was loud, wasn't it?"
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,It's so quiet here. I should've been more careful.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004,I'll...leave.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,"You see, I must be vigilant about the food 
that fuels me."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,"It seems silly, but..."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,I eat perfect food so I can dance perfectly.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004,"Though, a snack of honey and butter does 
sound perfect right now."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,"Ah, good morning."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,Did my footwork wake you?
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,"Well, perhaps..."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004,when the moon returns...
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#005,I'll dance for you.
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,"Waking the Divine Dragon...a strange 
task indeed."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,"Ah, you're already up, it seems."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,I'll save my wake-up services for another time.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,Sleeping soundly. This may prove challenging.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,I'll do a bit of dancing while I wait.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,Step...jump...turn...
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004,"Ah, yes. Nearly perfect."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,As I was saying...
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,you may encounter someone special to you.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004,"Oh, no."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#005,"I would never suggest it would be me. I will 
take my leave."
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,I read your fortune.
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002,"It says two paths await you today. But which 
one shall it be?"
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,"Ah, you woke quickly. Your card is Le Cheval."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,The War Horse.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,It means a busy day awaits...
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004,and you should wear yellow.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Ah, you sleep deeply. Your card is Le Pégase."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,The Pegasus.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,Good fortune awaits...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004,if you wear something blue.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#005,So the card says.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,"At last. I was starting to worry you wouldn't 
wake up."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,"Please, be careful out there today, and 
every day."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,"I can't have you join the stars in the sky 
without me."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,"Divine One, it's me. I'm here to wake you."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002,"But I can study my cards until you decide to 
join me."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,"Ah, good morning. I'm not surprised you 
woke so quickly."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,No. I did not see it in my cards.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,Some things are obvious...
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004,when you know someone as well as I know you.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Ah, I've drawn Le Destin, the card of fate."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,There can be no doubt...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,Destiny brought the two of us together.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,The stars aligned...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,the very moment I first saw you in the fortress.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,"And you, Divine One..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007,You have woven our fates together ever since.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#008,"I beg you, never let them come undone."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Ah...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,"Now that you're up, it's time for breakfast."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,I know.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,"Let's fuel our day with savory dishes while we 
savor our time..."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005,together.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,"The Pact Ring... I had this feeling it was guiding 
me here."
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002,Perhaps I imagined it?
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,Or perhaps it was you.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,Did you want to see me?
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,I hope so.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,"I hope you want to see me as much as I want 
to see you."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,This world is shrouded in many mysteries.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,"Was it you who guided me here somehow? 
And if so, for what reason?"
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,Perhaps it was so I'd dance for you once again.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,"I'll dance for you just like I did the day you gave 
me the ring."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,"And it'll remind you that I am yours, 
now and always."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,"My heart, my dancing, my everything... Every bit 
of it is yours, Divine One."
