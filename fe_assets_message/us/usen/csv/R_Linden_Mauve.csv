[Lindon] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Sir Lindon? Is all well? Is that your 
wife's picture?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
Hehe, you've caught me in a vulnerable 
moment. How embarrassing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lindon] 
A man my age should know when to let go of 
the past. Quite unbecoming of me..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Mauvier] 
There is nothing at all embarrassing about 
having a deep love for your spouse."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Lindon] 
Ah, you're right, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lindon] 
We raised three children, you know. 
They're all grown now, living their lives."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Lindon] 
They have their own homes, their own families... 
It's become difficult to gather all of us together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lindon] 
The further we grow apart, the brighter my 
memories seem to shine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Lindon] 
More and more, I find myself looking backward 
rather than forward."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lindon] 
I'm not sure how to change that...or if I should."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Mauvier] 
Having memories you enjoy looking back on is 
proof of a life well lived."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Mauvier] 
My own life knows more regrets than happiness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lindon] 
Ah, but you are now free to carve out a new 
life─one more fulfilling than my own, perhaps."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Mauvier] 
Hmm. Thank you for the kind words, Sir Lindon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lindon] 
Think nothing of it. Now...do you find yourself 
in the mood for experimental snacking science?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Mauvier] 
I should have known!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lindon] 
You speak of regrets? Never tasting Elthunder- 
popped corn would be most regrettable indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Mauvier] 
It is my understanding that I have a fulfilling life 
ahead, so be true with your aim."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Lindon] 
Huzzah! Let the experiment begin!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Sir Lindon, you dropped something."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Lindon] 
Oh! How clumsy of me. Thank you, Mauvier."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Mauvier] 
This is...the likeness of a young woman. 
She is quite beautiful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lindon] 
Ah! I heartily agree."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lindon] 
This is a drawing of my late wife."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Mauvier] 
Oh. Your wife, Sir Lindon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Lindon] 
She wasn't just beautiful. She was kind, loving... 
and the best friend I could have asked for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lindon] 
It's been some time since she passed, yet my 
love for her continues to grow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lindon] 
Ah, how I wish I could see her smile once more, 
taste her cooking again..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Mauvier] 
It hurts to see you sad. If there is anything 
I can do..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Lindon] 
Do you mean it? Oh, what a wonderful offer. 
Thank you, Mauvier!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lindon] 
Now, take this corn and hurl it skyward."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Mauvier] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Mauvier] 
Not this again!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lindon] 
Oh, but...my dear, late wife loved corn, you see. 
She would want us to celebrate her this way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lindon] 
Now then, whenever you're ready! I'm standing 
by to blast!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Lindon] 
I know what you're thinking, but don't worry. 
I probably─no, almost definitely─won't miss!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Mauvier] 
No. Goodbye, Sir Lindon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Mauvier] 

[Lindon] 
Mauvier? Mauvier, wait! You still have my corn!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 

[Lindon] 
Ah, Mauvier! Do you have a moment? I'd like 
your help with an experiment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Sir Lindon. Of course, I will help however I can."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Lindon] 
I need you to take this ear of corn...and throw 
it up into the air."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Mauvier] 
What sort of experiment is this?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lindon] 
I'm going to blast the corn with Elthunder and 
make it explode."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lindon] 
By my calculations, this will cause its kernels to 
""pop"" evenly, making for an immaculate snack!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Mauvier] 
This seems...ill thought out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Lindon] 
Well, you know what they say... ""No risk, no 
reward, no snacktime."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lindon] 
I suppose the most likely risk is that you might 
""pop"" instead...and not evenly, at that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Mauvier] 
Then I must decline."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Lindon] 
What? Oh, come now! Haven't you learned that 
you should always help your elders?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Mauvier] 
Have you not learned to never cast Elthunder 
near other people outside of battle?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Lindon] 
Hm! You argue like an elder yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Mauvier] 
I am more than happy to help with any and 
all experiments."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Mauvier] 
However, I will not risk my life for corn. 
My apologies, Sir Lindon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lindon] 
Oh, very well. I suppose snack time is 
postponed...for now."
