[Citrinne] 
Seadall, I apologize for losing my composure 
the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Seadall] 
No, don't apologize. I can see how much Brodia 
means to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
But I wanted to share this with you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Share what?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Seadall] 
I had a feeling you'd come, so I read Brodia's 
fortune again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Citrinne] 
And...what did you find?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Seadall] 
It's not that Brodia has no future. It's that a fog 
had settled around Brodia's future."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Seadall] 
I can finally see it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Seadall] 
I suspect the powerful feelings you hold for 
your home have driven the fog away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Citrinne] 
What did you see? What was on the other side 
of the fog?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Seadall] 
Brodia, after the rain has passed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Citrinne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Seadall] 
A period of darkness and strife will pass over 
Brodia and other countries..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Seadall] 
But when it's over, the sun will shine from 
between the clouds on your home."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Citrinne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Haha, thank you. I hope you're not just 
humoring me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Seadall] 
Huh? What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Citrinne] 
That fortune... You're not just saying that to 
make me feel better?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Seadall] 
No. I'm not running a scam or trying to make 
you feel good. I don't need to do that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Citrinne] 
I pray that is the case."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Citrinne] 
I have to say, with your help, I have been able 
to face reality in a way I couldn't before."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Citrinne] 
I can't passively wait for the future to come. 
I have to take it into my own hands."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Citrinne] 
For Brodia's sake. For the world's."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Seadall] 
I believe you will, Citrinne. And you have 
my support."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Citrinne] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Citrinne] 
Ah! I nearly forgot. You must allow me to 
compensate you for your services."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Seadall] 
Once peace has been achieved, you could give 
me a tour of Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Seadall] 
I love exploring places I've never been before."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Citrinne] 
That's a wonderful idea! Let's travel to one of 
the towns sometime soon. After a storm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Citrinne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
Citrinne, are you still worried about my reading 
the other day?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Citrinne] 
I am."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Citrinne] 
I have thought of little else since."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Seadall] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Citrinne] 
Brodia's towns... Have you ever been? 
They're wonderful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Especially after a nice, long bout of rain."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Citrinne] 
The sun peeks out from the clouds and all the 
buildings glitter─like a scene from a fairy tale."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Citrinne] 
As a young girl, I used to sit by the window 
during storms and wait for that moment."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Citrinne] 
I would even skip my ballroom dance practice 
and just sit there, waiting..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Seadall] 
It's a beautiful story...like one from a book."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Seadall] 
But reality isn't storybook beautiful very often. 
You can't just sit and wait for the rain to stop."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Citrinne] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Seadall] 
Sitting and worrying about what Brodia's fate 
might be won't help your homeland."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Citrinne] 
I know that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Citrinne] 
I'm not waiting by the window anymore. I'm out 
there in the mud, fighting for Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Citrinne] 
But I'm just one person. I can't protect the 
kingdom on my own."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Citrinne] 
And that... Well, it breaks my heart."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Seadall] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Citrinne] 
I have to go. Excuse me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Citrinne] 

[Seadall] 
Citrinne..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Seadall, is it true that you can tell fortunes?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Seadall] 
It is."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Seadall] 
I can divine anything, from the day's fortune 
to a person's greater fate."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Citrinne] 
What a marvelous talent! In that case... Would 
you read Brodia's future for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Seadall] 
Brodia's future?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Citrinne] 
Brodia is my home. I love my home."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
And since the start of the war, I have been 
worried about its future."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Seadall] 
Ah, you'd like to know the fate of the 
kingdom, then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Seadall] 
It...may not be good news. Are you sure you 
want me to do this?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Citrinne] 
Yes. I am prepared for the truth, whatever it 
may be."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Seadall] 
Understood. Then let's begin."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Seadall] 
Spirit of the Cards, cast your divine light so that 
I may see the fate that awaits great Brodia..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Seadall] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Seadall] 
It is revealed. Brodia's future..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Citrinne] 
Yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Seadall] 
I see...nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Citrinne] 
Nothing? What do you mean, nothing?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Seadall] 
It's just as I said. I see nothing. That's what the 
cards have shown me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Citrinne] 
That can't be..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Citrinne] 
Does that... Will the war bring my country 
to ruin?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Seadall] 
I admit...I'm not really sure myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Citrinne] 
I... I see. Well, thank you for the reading."
