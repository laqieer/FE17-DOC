MID_GR_Alfred_A_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Alfred] 
I hide it well, but I was a pretty sickly kid. My 
mother was always worried about my health."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Leif] 
It is your intense training that has brought you 
your current, robust health, I take it?"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
No doubt. I took it seriously and never missed 
a single workout session."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Leif] 
I could learn a lot from your dedication and how 
you overcome your problems without giving up."
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Why are you staring so intently at your arm?"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
Just checking in with my body. My arms say 
everything's A-OK! How about you, Leif?"
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Alfred] 
Nng, ngh, hyah... Another solid morning's 
training done with!"
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Leif] 
How driven he must be to begin his training so 
early in the morning! I must follow his example."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Why did you decide to join our cause?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Anna] 
Finding my family was a big part of it. Plus, if 
the world ends, my business goes kaput too."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Anna] 
I figure people will be so happy when the war 
ends that they'll be willing to spend big!"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Leif] 
Ha! You think big yourself, for one so small. 
I suspect you are correct."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
I see you are in high spirits again today, 
Lady Anna. Are you off to market?"
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Anna] 
Yep! Today I'm rolling out a special membership 
program for repeat customers."
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Have I...met you before?"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Anna] 
I'm Lady Anna, a traveling merchant! I sell only 
the best, so snap it up now or regret it later!"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You want to make a dish...out of the glowy light 
emitted by Emblems? Is this even possible?"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
So far, I haven't been able to capture the glow, 
but I am certain it will taste delicious when I do."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
Which is why I need you, Leif. I need you to use 
all your might to glow as brightly as you can."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Leif] 
I am not convinced this glow of mine will taste 
good. But for you Bunet, I will glow my best!"
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Bunet] 
I use my sense of taste to learn about the world. 
So, might I taste the glowing light around you?"
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Leif] 
You want to taste...the light? I wonder... Does 
each Emblem's glow have a unique flavor?"
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
I am called Sage Lord, but have much to learn. 
I hope you may teach me a thing or two."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Bunet] 
The Sage Lord...what a delicious title. I'm sure 
we can learn a great deal from each other, Leif."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Boucheron] 
You're not busy today, are you, Leif? Want to 
come fishing with me?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Leif] 
A fine idea. The weather is perfect for it."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Leif] 
And you shall need me along to prevent you 
from becoming lost on the way."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Hahaha, guilty as charged. Whether in or out of 
battle, I'd always be lost without you."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Have you lost your way again? Alfred was 
looking for you."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
So I keep hearing. If he doesn't stay put, we 
might be going in circles like this forever."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Boucheron? What are you doing here?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
The horse I was using as a landmark ran off. 
Could you tell me the way back to the prince?"
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Whatever has put you in such a good mood?"
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Céline] 
A new shoot sprouted in the courtyard flower 
bed. And I had a lovely cup of tea earlier today."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Céline] 
These small joys are to be cherished. I hope you 
don't think me childish for that."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Leif] 
Never! You have taught me that a happy life is 
built from the slow accumulation of small joys."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Céline] 
Won't you join me for tea? I've acquired a 
batch of the finest leaves in Firene."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Leif] 
They smell incredible. Like flowers, and the 
sun, and the rich, fertile ground..."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Céline] 
I shall need your aid, Leif, if I hope to protect 
my beloved Firene─let alone the world."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Leif] 
You will have it, Céline. Let us fight so that the 
people can be secure in a peaceful world."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Chloé] 
Hey, Leif, don't go too overboard, OK?"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Leif] 
What brought on the sudden bout of concern?"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
Well, you always seem a little tense. Relax! 
I'm here for you."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Leif] 
I am still not quite used to this world, I suppose. 
Your help will get me there. Thank you, Chloé."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Whatever are you eating, Chloé?"
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
A large snake boiled in medicinal herbs. 
I'm really sorry I can't share with you."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Chloé] 
I think the thing that makes you most like a 
fairy-tale hero is your bright, shining armor."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Leif] 
I am no hero, though. That role was foisted 
upon me by others."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I became Alcryst's retainer through my family's 
connections. My actual skills are...rather lacking."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Citrinne] 
I'm working hard to improve, but everyone else 
is so strong. I don't think I'll ever catch up."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Leif] 
Try not to rush yourself. Strength in battle is 
not something you can achieve overnight."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Leif] 
Besides, your allies count on you for more than 
sheer strength. That is certainly true of me."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Tell me, Citrinne, why did you want to become 
one of Alcryst's retainers?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Citrinne] 
He's my cousin. I wanted to protect him, so 
I spoke with my family and... Well, here I am!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Oh! I'm sorry, Leif. You must have thought I 
was glaring at you. That's just my resting face."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Leif] 
That was not my thinking at all, Citrinne. 
You have a very kind aura about you."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
I heard Framme using a word─""venerable."" 
It means more than simply being ""likable,"" yes?"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Clanne] 
True. It's a bit more than just being likable."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
It's more like saying you respect somebody 
because they're full of wisdom."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Leif] 
I see. There are truly strong feelings attached to 
the word. I shall try to use it sometime soon."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Clanne, you are busy as ever today. Is all of 
your effort in the name of the Divine Dragon?"
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
Yes! It takes a lot of work to make sure the 
Divine Dragon gets enough rest."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Clanne] 
Lord Leif, do you have any suggestions for how 
to be someone the Divine Dragon can rely on?"
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Leif] 
I think you have more to teach me in that 
respect than I have to offer you."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Diamant] 
The truth is, I'm not as confident as I may seem. 
I've never told anyone that─not even Alcryst."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Leif] 
I once lacked confidence...but my friends guided 
me and helped my heart grow much stronger."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Leif] 
You have great friends too, Diamant. This quest 
is how you will grow, and I will be by your side."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Diamant] 
Thank you, Leif. I'll strive to become a king as 
wise as you...the Sage Lord himself."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Diamant] 
The people of Elusia deeply resent my country. 
I need to foster peace between our nations."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Leif] 
Do not rush. I believe you are the best person to 
find a way forward, but these things take time."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Diamant] 
It's such an honor to be speaking with you, Leif. 
I have much to discuss regarding my kingdom..."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Leif] 
I look forward to working with you as well, 
Diamant. I am happy to help however I can."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Seeing the things you put yourself through in 
the name of training is rather daunting."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Etie] 
It's not for the faint of heart, that's for sure. 
But I've got a secret weapon."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Etie] 
It's a Firenese muscle balm. It boosts the effects 
of your training, no matter who you are."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Leif] 
But even with that, you still have to train, right? 
If only you could cut that part out entirely..."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Etie] 
You look a little nervous. You know what helps 
with that? Weight training!"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Leif] 
I may as well. I doubt I can develop any muscle, 
but it should be invigorating anyway."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Etie, are you all right?! I heard an unearthly 
noise."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Etie] 
Sorry about that! I was training a little too hard 
and accidentally took out a wall."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Fogado] 
So, Leif, um...are you good at fishing? And if 
you are, would you mind teaching me?"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Leif] 
Teach you to fish? You do not know how?"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
I know. Seems like I should, but I don't. Please, 
you're the only one I'm comfortable asking."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Leif] 
Haha, in that case, I am pleased you asked. 
I may not teach you well, but I will teach you!"
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Fogado] 
You know, my sister is real tough. Still, I can't 
help but feel like I should protect her."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Leif] 
I know how you feel. I would want to help my 
sister as well. Siblings are like that."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Fogado] 
All right, all right! It's time to do my rounds. 
I tell you, I am no good at sitting still."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Leif] 
If you are going on patrol, I shall join you. It will 
be nice to have a chat off the battlefield."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Framme] 
OK, what we do now is wait at that corner for 
the Divine One to pass by."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Framme] 
Yes. The line of sight seems like it'd be perfect. 
Is it really OK to bring you along for this stuff?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Leif] 
Of course! I asked you to, remember? I enjoy 
learning about your unusual style of worship."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Leif] 
They're coming. Let's go, Framme. It will be the 
best angle to see from, do you agree?"
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You are training again today, Framme? Your 
tireless efforts are most impressive!"
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Framme] 
I gotta be in tip-top shape for praying to the 
Divine One. My prayers are very athletic."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You look as if you are deep in concentration. 
Whatever could have you so preoccupied?"
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Framme] 
I'm making an outfit to celebrate how great the 
Divine Dragon is!"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Is something the matter? You seem dejected."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I am thinking of all the distraction I've inflicted 
on others in battle with my alluring elegance."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Is it selfish that I want you to notice how 
charming I am, even in the middle of a war?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Leif] 
Do not trouble yourself over that, Goldmary. 
You are a fine ally to have on the battlefield."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if my dazzling grace distracts you 
in battle. I'm afraid it's out of my control."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Leif] 
No need to apologize. If by some chance I were 
distracted, it would be my fault, not yours."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Goldmary] 
You know, Leif, I wouldn't blame you if you 
began to develop feelings for me."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Leif] 
I already have feelings about you, Goldmary. 
I think you and I will make good friends."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Do you think it's OK to believe what I want, 
even if my country worships the Fell Dragon?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Leif] 
If you are asking me that, I would say you must 
already have the answer you seek."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Ugh, way to avoid the question. Can you just 
give me some validation, please?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Leif] 
Haha, I think you should do what you feel is 
right, and I am happy to help you decide that."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
It is time to move out, Hortensia. Are you 
ready? Is something wrong with your head?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Hortensia] 
I'm trying to get my hair right! You don't expect 
me to go to battle looking like this, do you?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Hortensia] 
You've seen my sister fight up close, Leif. 
I know she's good. How do I measure up?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Leif] 
Your skills are impressive indeed. I look forward 
to seeing more of your work on the battlefield."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Ivy] 
I wish I could be more like you and the Divine 
One. You are both so honest and pure."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Ivy] 
I want people to believe me─to believe in me. 
It sounds ridiculous saying it out loud."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Leif] 
It is not ridiculous at all. In fact, I would argue 
this wish of yours has already come true."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Leif] 
You are surrounded by friends and allies, 
are you not? They believe in you. As do I."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Ivy] 
There is so much to be done, and yet I only 
seem capable of wallowing in my own regrets."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Leif] 
Honest introspection is never easy. But take 
heart─you will make a fine queen."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Ivy] 
Having your power used against your will... 
You must be furious."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Leif] 
Nothing of the sort, Ivy. I am honored to fight 
at your side."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Jade] 
Leif? Do you have a spare moment?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Leif] 
Yes, I have time right now. What would you like 
to discuss?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Jade] 
I need a twist for my new novel. Are there any 
tales from your world that might inspire me?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Leif] 
I see! I would be happy to assist. Let me begin 
with the story of the 12 crusaders..."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Whatever is the matter, Jade? You look as if 
something has upset you."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Jade] 
Huh? No, I'm fine. In fact, I'm in a particularly 
good mood. Is it that hard to tell?"
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Jade? I can feel you staring at me... Do I have 
something on my face?"
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Jade] 
Huh? No. Sorry, Leif. I was lost in a new story 
idea, but...it's gone now."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Jean] 
How did you get to be so strong, Leif? I wish 
I was more like you."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Leif] 
I wonder the same thing about others. Besides, 
Jean, you are stronger than you know already."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Jean] 
It doesn't feel like that. I've put in the study and 
practiced a lot, but I'm not a great doctor yet."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Leif] 
No need to hurry. Simply fix your eyes upon 
your goal and reach it one step at a time."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You did very well last time. It was due to your 
efforts that we had no serious injuries."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Jean] 
I can patch people up, but what I'm working for 
is a world where they don't get hurt."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
That last battle was rather vicious. Are you all 
right, Jean?"
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Jean] 
Thanks for asking, but it'll take more than that 
to discourage me."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Tell me more stories of your world, Leif. 
I am very curious."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Leif] 
I have already told you almost all there is to tell. 
I will run out of material very soon at this rate."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
My curiosity is not even close to running out! 
Tell me more! I demand satisfaction!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Leif] 
Ha! Very well. Let me tell you of a battle which 
hinged on the efficacy of murder holes..."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
You are well practiced in swordplay, are you 
not? Come, show me your skill!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Leif] 
You would like to spar? All right. I will gladly 
show you the swordsmanship of Leonster."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Please ask if you need something, Leif. I am 
always happy to help my dearest friends."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Leif] 
Thank you, Kagetsu. No one has called me 
a dearest friend quite so quickly as you."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
The country of Thracia was mostly barren land. 
This led to wars between the north and south."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Lapis] 
I bet food was hard to come by out there. That 
reminds me... Have you ever eaten bear?"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Leif] 
We did not encounter many bears...but there 
were plenty of wyverns."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
I've never tried wyvern... How do they taste? 
How does their meat keep? Tell me more!"
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Are you weeding during your break? You are 
such a diligent worker, Lapis."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Lapis] 
I don't know about that. I'm just stocking up on 
backup rations. I mean, uh... Yep! I'm weeding!"
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Lapis] 
Mmm, sugar water is such a great pick-me-up... 
Ah! Leif?! Have you been here the whole time?"
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Leif] 
Incredible! There are so many ways to consume 
sugar... You are so knowledgeable, Lapis."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Oh! That smells so good. Is it one of the 
cookies you baked with magic?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Lindon] 
Haha! That it is. If only you could taste it!"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Leif] 
The scent is enough for me. I am very intrigued 
by your method of baking with magic."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Lindon] 
Magic can be a boon or a bane depending on 
how you use it. I bake to remind people of that."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
That portrait you carry with you everywhere... 
Is that your wife?"
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Lindon] 
Ah, you noticed it, did you? What do you think? 
She was quite the woman, you know."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Lindon] 
I'm Lindon. Pleased to meet you. You let these 
old bones know if they can help you in any way."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Leif] 
You are more than your bones, I am sure. I am 
very glad to have your help."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You have a grim look today, Louis. Is there 
something wrong?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Louis] 
Yes. Try as I might, I'm having difficulty 
completely fading into the background."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Leif] 
Ah, it would be a useful talent for setting up an 
ambush. I have no advice for you, though."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Louis] 
I had thought more along the lines of observing 
scenes play out naturally. But still, thank you."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Louis] 
I've brewed some tea. Shall we enjoy it together 
while admiring the scenery?"
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Leif] 
It smells most wonderful, Louis. I assume by 
""scenery,"" you mean those people over there?"
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Louis] 
Is there anything I can do for you, Leif? Perhaps 
find you a suitable partner for socializing?"
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Leif] 
Uh, that is quite all right, Louis. Thank you for 
offering, though."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Alear] 
Am I doing enough in your opinion, Leif? I feel 
like everyone expects so much of me..."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Leif] 
It is hard to bear such a burden on your own. 
Focus not on your failings, but your strengths."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Alear] 
My strengths?"
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Leif] 
People believe in you. They follow you. Show 
them a path to peace, and they will walk it."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Alear] 
It's hard knowing that my mother loved me so 
much, but I can never repay her kindness."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Leif] 
It is enough that you express those feelings. 
Somewhere, your mother is surely listening."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Alear] 
I fight to save the world that my mother loved. 
But I'll need your help, Leif."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Leif] 
If it can bring about the peace you desire so 
strongly, then my sword arm is yours!"
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Protecting those I hold dear is my goal. Yet, so 
often my decision making is poor."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Leif] 
It is too early to know the impact of all your 
choices. Your story is far from over."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Leif] 
Trust your instincts─act to protect your friends."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
Thank you. You are correct. My doubts cloud 
my judgment, and they shall be abandoned."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Mauvier] 
This place and these people...are too kind. 
Dealing with such behavior is confusing."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Leif] 
Where lies the confusion? You are their ally, and 
they assume they are yours."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Sir Leif, your combat skills are impressive. Is it 
inconvenient to ask we join forces again, soon?"
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Leif] 
No inconvenience at all. I will happily fight at 
your side any day."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Merrin] 
When we finally have peace, I plan to travel. My 
dream is to see animals no one has seen before."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Merrin] 
I've traveled some, of course, but there's still so 
much to see. Sir Leif, what do you dream of?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Leif] 
I suppose I dream of seeing my hometown 
flourishing and at peace."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Leif] 
But that is my dream as a king. Perhaps I should 
find my own personal dream just as you have."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Merrin, I have noticed you carefully observing 
animals on several occasions. Why is that?"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Merrin] 
I like to study things I admire. In fact, I have 
studied you on occasion as well, Sir Leif."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Merrin] 
Sir Leif, I wonder if we could discuss the recent 
battle? I'd like your honest opinion on a matter."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Leif] 
Of course! I am always happy to provide 
whatever knowledge or insight I can."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Is something amiss, Timerra? You have not been 
singing of late. That is quite unusual for you."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
Oh, Leif. I wrote this new song about how much 
I love Emblems, but no one wants to listen to it."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Leif] 
About Emblems, you say? As an Emblem 
myself, I would be happy to have a listen."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
Really?! You're the best. I'm gonna belt it out 
straight from the heart just for you! Here goes..."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Timerra] 
You gotta appreciate a lady with a sense 
of style, am I right?"
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Leif] 
Oh, uh, yes. I once cherished a lady who 
I thought to be quite stylish."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
A pleasure to meet you, Timerra. I vow to do 
my best and earn your friendship along the way."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Timerra] 
Pleasure's all mine. Oh, I just thought of a song! 
♪La-la-Leif, he's better than deep-fried beef!♪"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You seem unusually busy today. Are you 
preparing for some kind of event?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Yes, in fact! I'm preparing for a banquet. 
A banquet...to celebrate our friendship!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
There's a seat just for you. It's the one with 
all the decorations. There's a card for you too."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Leif] 
It says, ""Thank you for everything."" Ah, you are 
too kind. I should be thanking you, Pandreo."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lord Leif, I understand your parents passed 
away. Would it be OK if I prayed for them?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Leif] 
So very thoughtful of you, Pandreo. I believe 
my mother and father would appreciate it."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Ah, Lord Leif! I─ I'm so nervous. I haven't even 
greeted you. Here goes... AROOO!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Leif] 
AROO! That is your greeting? The etiquette 
traditions in this country are strange indeed."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Panette] 
You have arrived at a most opportune time. I am 
about to have a snack. Would you join me?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Leif] 
Yes, thank you. Though I will have to enjoy the 
smell only. Are you eating those red...things?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Panette] 
Indeed, I am! They are my favorite chips. I'm 
told some people find their smell quite unusual."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Leif] 
Gah! Unusual...yes...quite. You do enjoy some 
peculiar things."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Panette] 
Time to pull these lousy weeds. Get outta here! 
Oh, Leif! However might I be of service to you?"
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Leif] 
Oh, well, I thought I might help you with the 
gardening. But you seem to have it well in hand."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Panette! Why is there an insect trapped inside 
that bottle?"
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Panette] 
Because I plan to keep it, that's why. Just look 
at it! Its colors are truly splendid to behold."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Rosado] 
It's time we realized the full potential of your 
cuteness, Leif. Take a look at this!"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Leif] 
That is quite a colorful outfit. And a very nice 
wig, as well. Are these...for me?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
Of course! Cuteness is the highest virtue, 
remember. Do your part for the cause, OK?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Leif] 
Regrettably, I cannot. As fine as these may be, 
I lack the physical form needed to wear them."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
What motivates you to be a soldier, Rosado? 
There is nothing cute about war."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Rosado] 
Of course not. But I fight so everyone can have 
the chance to be cute."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Rosado] 
Cuteness is the highest virtue. I've never seen 
a cute thing I didn't love."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Leif] 
There is something to be said for simple and 
straightforward values. Good for you."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Saphir, what are you doing with that fish?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Saphir] 
I got it from a friend, but even if I cook it, it's 
too much for one person to eat."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Leif] 
I am sure I could track down a few people who 
would be happy to enjoy your cooking."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
Hehe, thanks. If we're having a feast, though, 
I'd better use a fancier recipe."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Saphir] 
War is horrible, but that's exactly why we have 
to fight. I don't want to lose anyone else."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Leif] 
I feel the same way. War may be a tragedy, but 
we must fight to prevent an even greater one."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Saphir] 
Have I got something on my face, Leif? 
You're staring."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Leif] 
Forgive me─you simply remind me of someone. 
A strong woman who was very dear to me."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You seem so full of confidence, Seadall. 
But you still evade savory treats, correct?"
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Seadall] 
Think nothing of it. My dancing is strong, and 
puts a smile on the face of all who see it."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
But, Leif, I have seen Le Chariot in your fortune. 
You have evaded much yourself. Grief, perhaps?"
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Leif] 
I have. But that is where I get my strength from. 
I will make the people I lost proud of who I am."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Seadall] 
Tempting as it is, I avoid food that is not the 
perfect fuel for my dance. This, for instance..."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Leif] 
I see lots of oil, butter, sugar... That does 
look delicious."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Seadall] 
You should watch me dance, Leif. I've read your 
fortune, and it says dancing will bring you luck."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Leif] 
Oh? Your fortune-telling accuracy is renowned. 
I shall be sure to see your performance."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Brodia is known for its precious gems, but I 
fight for our people. They're the real treasure."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Leif] 
That sounds like the mindset of a true leader. 
Brodia's citizens must be proud of you, Alcryst."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Alcryst] 
N-no, that can't be true. How could they? If the 
citizens are like gems, I'm more like...a pebble."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Leif] 
You place value in your country's people. I am 
sure they value you in return...and so do I."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Why are you standing so far away, Alcryst? 
Please, come a little closer."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
So majestic... So regal... Huh? Oh! No thank 
you, Leif. I'm fine back here in your periphery."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Hello, Alcryst. Have you been enjoying this 
gentle weather? I certainly have."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Are you talking to me?! Oh, Leif, your kind 
heart makes me so nervous. I'm not worthy."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Amber] 
I want to create an entire battalion of alpacas, 
but I can't get Prince Diamant to sign off on it..."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Leif] 
Hmm... If I were Diamant, I would surely prefer 
horses. Alpacas may be difficult to mobilize."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Leif] 
What unique strengths do alpacas have? If you 
lead with those, he might be easier to convince."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Amber] 
Oh, there are so many! Like, um...uh... Oh! 
Their cuteness! It'll sap an enemy's will to fight!"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You seem to be in high spirits today, Amber. 
You receive some good news?"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Amber] 
I found a recipe for a legendary secret potion 
that gives you endless energy! Wanna see, Leif?"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Amber] 
I'm Amber, one of Prince Diamant's retainers. 
You can call me the alpaca-wrangling master!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Leif] 
The alpaca-wrangling master, you say... 
That has a curiously pleasant ring to it."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
I see an old friend when I look at you. Sadly, his 
death was a result of my carelessness."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Leif] 
He sacrificed everything to fulfill my wishes. 
And I could give him nothing in return..."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Vander] 
I do not know this person, but I imagine they 
were proud to have served you."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Vander] 
To have someone in their life who was both lord 
and friend? A rare blessing indeed."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Vander] 
The Divine Dragon's sometimes-reckless 
behavior can put quite a fright in me."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Leif] 
Understandable, though danger is a fact of life. 
It's our job to keep that danger in check."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Vander] 
Sir Leif, please, would you offer some guidance 
to the Divine Dragon? It seems needed."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Leif] 
Gladly. If I can help, I will do so."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Veyle? Did you need me for something?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
Leif, I've been so happy fighting by your side. 
I...I hope you'll always be my comrade in arms."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Leif] 
Of course I will, Veyle. I will be your comrade- 
in-arms... No, your friend, now and forever."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
Oh, thank you! I promise I'll do everything I can 
and make you proud to stand by my side."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Those look delicious, though that hint of red 
makes me think them too fiery for my tastes."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Veyle] 
You have a good eye! These sweets are very 
spicy. Hmm, I guess I better not share them."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Veyle] 
I have done terrible things to you, Leif, and to 
the others. You must hate fighting beside me."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Leif] 
I do not hate it, Veyle, I assure you. You are a 
welcome partner on the battlefield and off."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Ugh... Think I did one too many impressions. 
Throat's killing me."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Leif] 
Yes, you may have overdone it. I wish I could 
offer you a restorative drink from my homeland."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Leif] 
That stuff could heal any ailment. It would have 
fixed you right up."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
I can pretend. Power of imagination, right? 
Keep describing it. I'll tell you when it works."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
I heard quite a strange cackle coming from this 
direction. What is going on, Yunaka?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Oh, not much─just got my hands on some of 
the deadliest weaponry you've ever seen."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Y'know, Leif, I get the feeling you've been 
through some tough stuff. I respect that."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Leif] 
The feeling is mutual, Yunaka. I admire your 
fighting spirit."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Leif] 2 

[Zelkov] 
What do you *intend* to do next, after we have 
achieved our aims?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Leif] 
When all is done, and there is no more reason to 
call on me, I suppose I will return to my ring."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
Does the notion of *idleness* therein not 
trouble you? Are you even conscious in there?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Leif] 
It is like sleeping. Perhaps I will content myself 
to dream of the time we spent together."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
Perhaps you could teach me how to make 
medicine. It would be useful for me to know."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Absolutely not. Making medicine is my *role.* 
What would I do if you replaced me?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Leif] 2 
[Leif] 
You are always in a rush to find something to 
do after a battle, Zelkov. Are you all right?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Your concern is unwarranted. I am simply 
returning to the pursuits which *sustain* me."
