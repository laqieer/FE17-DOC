[Alear] 
Framme, I'm sorry for what I said. I didn't mean 
to upset you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Framme] 
Nah, it's OK. I'm sorry for bursting into tears 
like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Framme] 
I've just felt...really attached to you since you 
woke up. No, scratch that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Framme] 
Since BEFORE you woke up. I used to sit and 
chat with you about my life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
Really?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Framme] 
Yeah. If something exciting happened, I'd tell 
you the good news with a big smile on my face."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Framme] 
Or if something was making me sad, I'd sit 
next to you and have a good cry about it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Framme] 
You were always so easy to talk to. Every single 
day I sat there and waited for you to wake up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
I... I didn't realize that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Framme] 
I knew you couldn't actually hear me. I was just 
living out my own little fantasy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Framme] 
But then you woke up! I was so excited to talk 
to you for real, I...I got kinda carried away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
Framme, I have a request."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
Please go back to cheering for me like you 
did before."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Framme] 
What?! But you said..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
I did. But that was before I knew you kept me 
company for so long."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
As far as I'm concerned, you can be as loud and 
distracting as your heart desires."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Framme] 
Oh, Divine One... You're every bit as amazing as 
I always imagined."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Framme] 
OK. I, Framme, a president of the D.D.F.C., 
swear to continue my wholehearted support."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Framme] 
As your number-one fan, I'll keep cheering for 
you with all my heart and soul!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
Perfect. I wouldn't have it any other way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Framme] 
AHH! THE DIVINE ONE LOOKED RIGHT 
AT ME!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Framme] 2 

[Alear] 
Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
Whew. Time to take a short break and get a 
drink of water."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Framme] 
AHH! The Divine Dragon looks so cool 
drinking water!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Framme] 
Note for the fan club─the Divine Dragon 
loooves to drink water."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
Hey, Framme? Can I talk to you for a minute? 
It's kind of important."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Framme] 
You want to have an important conversation 
with ME? Am I dreaming? Is this happening?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
No, you're not, and yes, it is. Look, I'm sorry to 
say this, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
Could you take it easy with the cheers 
and whatnot?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Framme] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
I appreciate the enthusiasm, but really. You're 
making it hard to focus."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alear] 
When each battle is more difficult than the last, 
I can't afford to be distracted during training."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Framme] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Framme] 
You're... You're right. I wanted to support you, 
but I'm just being annoying."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Framme] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
Oh! I'm sorry. I didn't intend to─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Framme] 
No, it's not your fault. I'm only crying 'cause 
I'm so worthless..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Framme] 
I promise to stay out of your hair from now on! 
Your beautiful, flowing, perfect hair! WAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
Aw, Framme..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Framme] 2 

[Alear] 
Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Framme] 
AHH! Divine One, you look so shiny when 
you sweat!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Framme] 
Hey! Hey! Look over here! Hey!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Framme] 
AH! The Divine One looked right at me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Framme] 
Thank you, universe, for creating someone so 
awesome and so very...shiny."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
Um...Framme?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Framme] 
Oh, sorry! Am I distracting you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
Well, you're not...not distracting me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Framme] 
Oops! Sorry, sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Framme] 
See, I'm here in my capacity as a president of 
the Divine Dragon Fan Club."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
I have a...fan club?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Framme] 
Yep! Our mission is to support you. That's why 
I'm here giving you extra motivation."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
Huh. Thanks for cheering me on."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alear] 
But could you maybe not do it so...close?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Framme] 
You bet. I can stand back a little."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Framme] 
Four, three, two, one, who's our favorite 
dragon?! You! You! Y-O-U!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alear] 
Ah, that didn't help..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Framme] 2 
[Alear] 1"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Hey, Framme! There you are."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Framme] 
Divine One, it's you! What can I do for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
I have something important to talk to you about. 
It's time, I think, to re-evaluate the D.D.F.C."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Framme] 
Wha..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Framme] 
I... I tried to make sure my cheering wasn't so 
annoying. I guess it didn't work, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
No, no! That's not it at all."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Framme] 
Oh, are you promoting the Divine Dragon Fan 
Club to Divine Dragon OFFICIAL Fan Club?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
No, that's not it either."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Framme] 
Demoting us to unofficial fan club then..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
Um, definitely not that."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Framme] 
Well, what is it then, Divine One? Come on!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
OK, OK, here goes. I don't want you to be my 
number one fan."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Framme] 
WHAA?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Framme] 
N-no...too painful... Can't breathe..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Framme] 
If I'm not a fan of the Divine Dragon, then... 
then...who am I even?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
Whoa, Framme. Please calm down. I don't want 
you to be my number one fan because..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
I want you to be my number one ally."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Framme] 
Number one ally..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Framme] 
NUMBER ONE ALLY?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
You had my back long before I woke up."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
You watched over me on sunny days and on 
rainy days. On happy days and sad days..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Framme] 
Y-yes! Of course! I'd love to be your number 
one ally! You and me, battle friends forever!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Well then, Framme, this is for you..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Framme] 
The P-pact Ring?! But, Divine One, that's 
super valuable. Are you sure?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Alear] 
I am."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Framme] 
WAAAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
Oh no, Framme, are you OK?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Framme] 
I'm─ I'm just so happy! You didn't just look at 
me, you offered me the Pact Ring!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Framme] 
I─ I accept! I really, really do!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Alear] 
That makes me happy, Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Framme] 
Oh, uh, but just one teensy thing... I don't want 
to stop being your fan."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033,"[Framme] 
I want to be your number one ally and your 
number one fan. Is that OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034,"[Framme] 
You mean everything to me. Plus, I think I can 
handle both roles, ya know?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035,"[Alear] 
Hahaha, if anyone can, you can. I am very lucky 
to have an ally and a fan like you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#036,"[Framme] 
Thank you, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#037,"[Framme] 
From now on, I'll be cheering you on and 
standing by your side. Allies for always!"
