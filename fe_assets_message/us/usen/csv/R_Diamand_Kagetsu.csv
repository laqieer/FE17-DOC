[Kagetsu] 2 
[Diamant] 
Another draw. I can't believe it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Nor I. You are much stronger than before. 
I was certain I would win this time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
Same here. You put in some real work after our 
last duel, didn't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
A strong opponent provides much motivation 
to grow. Thank you, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Diamant] 
Is that why you challenged me to begin with? 
To grow stronger?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
That is part of my reason...but only part."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
My true interest is in learning about the world."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Diamant] 
How do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
Custom, ideology, philosophy... There are many 
differences in other cultures I do not yet grasp."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
But there are many similarities as well─such as 
our views with regard to swords."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
I believe, as you do, that crossing swords can 
teach us more of one another than mere words."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
That is why I wander in search of strong and 
interesting opponents."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Diamant] 
Ahh, so that was your goal..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Diamant] 
I'm a bit jealous, to be honest. My position often 
prevents me from traveling on my own terms."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps you could experience travel through 
me. I would be glad to share stories."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Diamant] 
I'd like that. I do enjoy a good adventure story."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Diamant] 
Uh... Pardon me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
Haha, no need to apologize. Our duel has 
worked you up to hunger!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Kagetsu] 
Here, have some onigiri. It is made with rice. 
Delicious and refreshing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Diamant] 
Huh. Odd shape, but food is food."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Diamant] 
It's...so sour!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
There are plums inside, dried and salted. 
Does it not soothe your tired body?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Diamant] 
It definitely has a kick out of the gate. Hm... 
I could get used to these."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps this could be another frontier for us 
to explore together, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Diamant] 
Like a meal exchange? Sounds fun. Let's put 
down our swords and load up some plates."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
We are well matched, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Your strength is beyond my expectations!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Diamant] 
You're not so bad yourself, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Diamant] 
You'll have to keep giving this duel everything 
you've got. I certainly will."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Diamant] 
So? Do you want to keep going?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
I have fought with all my strength. I am content 
to leave it here and not push us to exhaustion."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Diamant] 
Same here. You're quite an opponent!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
I realize you put much of your valuable time 
toward this. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Diamant] 
It was fun. We'll have a rematch soon, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
Would you like to?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Diamant] 
We can't just let this end in a draw, can we?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Diamant] 
I'll warn you...our next battle is going to end 
very differently."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Diamant] 
I'll lay my honor as a crown prince on the line 
and fight until you're begging for mercy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
You speak boldly. But I swear by my blade 
that I shall have victory!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Diamant] 
Your blade is rather impressive. I can tell you 
sharpen it often."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
Our swords reflect our souls. I tend to mine 
each and every day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
Yours is majestic and powerful as well."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Diamant] 
Ah, well... Brodian culture prioritizes strength, 
so I make sure my sword is a symbol of that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Diamant] 
And just like you, I consider it to be more than a 
simple weapon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
It is interesting. Our cultures are far apart, and 
yet this perception of weapons unites us."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Diamant] 
It's amazing how well you get to know a person 
once you start crossing swords with them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
Knowledge beyond words. I look forward 
to our next contest."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Prince Diamant! I must see your skill. 
Let us duel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Diamant] 
A duel? Sounds like fun."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Diamant] 
I don't believe we've had a proper sparring 
match yet, have we?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
Ah, you are easy to convince. Good!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Diamant] 
You like to train, right? I have a pretty rigorous 
routine myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Diamant] 
I just got done sprinting up and over three local 
mountains. A duel sounds like a nice cooldown."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
Mountains? Three mountains?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Diamant] 
All right, Kagetsu. Give me everything 
you've got!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
I cannot."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Diamant] 
What? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
Much as I long to challenge you, it would not do 
to face you in this state."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
It would not be satisfying to win merely 
because you are tired."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Diamant] 
So you won't challenge me unless I'm fresh out 
of bed? A win is a win, so let's duel!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
No. I cannot allow it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
I have been raised to prize honor above victory. 
That is my homeland's way."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
Win or lose, it is essential to uphold standards 
of dignity and fairness."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
We must be like cherry blossoms, blooming 
only at appropriate times."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Diamant] 
Ah, I see. That is an admirable philosophy. 
Let's consider our duel...postponed."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
Thank you. I know it was I who extended this 
invitation. I appreciate your understanding."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Diamant] 
I'll make sure I'm rested and at full strength 
next time. I won't hold anything back."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
Excellent! I look forward to this fine contest."
