[Etie] 2 

[Etie] 
Hey, I owe you an apology."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Oh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Etie] 
I kept watching you and watching you, but I 
never learned anything."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Etie] 
So it must be true that you're just... 
naturally muscular."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Etie] 
Sorry I never believed you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Boucheron] 
I don't mind, as long as you've accepted it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Etie] 
I guess I'd better explain myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Boucheron] 
Go on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Etie] 
It's not that I'm jealous of your build."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Etie] 
But for the sake of the prince we both serve, 
I wanted to learn whatever I could from you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Etie] 
That's why I kept pushing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Boucheron] 
So that was it, hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Etie] 
Yes. I'm tough, but I could still contribute more 
to our country's defense."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Etie] 
That's why I wanted to get as buff as you are. 
For Prince Alfred and our beloved Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Etie, you haven't thought this through."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Boucheron] 
If you were more like me, Firene wouldn't have 
any defenses left."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Etie] 
How do you figure?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Boucheron] 
It's true that I'm naturally muscular. I can see 
why you'd want what I've got."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Boucheron] 
But I'm naturally flawed in other areas, like my 
woeful sense of direction."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Boucheron] 
Think back to how many times you saved me 
from getting lost during combat."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Boucheron] 
I have my strong points and you have yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Boucheron] 
Real strength comes in when the two of us are 
together and we complement each other."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Etie] 
You know..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Etie] 
I never thought of it like that, but you're right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Etie] 
I was so focused on building muscle that I never 
saw it that way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Boucheron] 
Muscles aren't a competition. They're the 
bridge formed when we clasp hands."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Boucheron] 
That's Boucheron's First Law of Muscle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Etie] 
I don't know what you mean by that exactly... 
but it sounds pretty."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Boucheron] 
I was trying to clear the air. It doesn't seem to 
have worked."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Boucheron] 
Listen, Etie..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Boucheron] 
For our prince, and for the kingdom of Firene, 
I'm honored to be at your side."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Etie] 
Thank you, though the honor is mine. Let us 
follow the First Law of Muscle and clasp hands."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Boucheron] 
Ah, just look at that light filtering through the 
trees. What a perfect afternoon spot."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Etie] 2 

[Etie] 
Boucheron!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Etie! You startled me. Do you need something?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Etie] 
Just here to observe."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Boucheron] 
Observe what, may I ask?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Etie] 
You, obviously. I will uncover your secret."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Boucheron] 
Go ahead, Etie. I clearly can't stop you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Etie] 
You're darn right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Etie] 
Hmm. Nothing unusual on the surface. Your 
clothes don't hang like they're weighted."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Etie] 
Wait a minute. There's something hard under 
those clothes! So you did have a secret!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Boucheron] 
Those are my abs."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Etie] 
Oh... Uh... Pardon me. I thought it might have 
been an arcane...ab buster."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Etie] 
Some kind of...enchanted plate that...works 
your core just by wearing it. I don't know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Boucheron] 
I've never heard of anything like that, but if I 
find one, I'll give it to you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Etie] 
How thoughtful of you..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Boucheron] 
Anyway, you caught me just as I was about to 
have my lunch."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Boucheron] 
This should hit the spot."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Etie] 
Hold it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Boucheron] 
What is it now?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Etie] 
I bet that sandwich is where you're keeping 
your secret."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Etie] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Etie] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Boucheron] 
No! My sandwich!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Etie] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Etie] 
Strange. It tasted like an ordinary sandwich."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Etie] 
I thought for sure you'd added some kind of 
special sauce to it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Boucheron] 
For the last time, I'm using no such thing. 
It's just my lunch, and I'd like it back."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Etie] 2 

[Etie] 
Are you ready yet, Boucheron?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Hmm? Ready for what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Etie] 
Ready to tell me what you're mixing into your 
food to get those muscles."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Hahaha, not this again. I've told you before 
that it's got nothing to do with my diet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Etie] 
That's what you say, yes. But today, I'm going 
to get the truth."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Boucheron] 
But that is the truth."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Boucheron] 
Muscles come naturally to me. That's the long 
and the short of it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Etie] 
Still sticking to that story, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Etie] 
Because I should tell you up front that I've been 
watching you, Boucheron."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Boucheron] 
You have? And?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Etie] 
And I know you don't do anything but fish or 
read all day after training each morning."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Etie] 
There I am, working up a sweat, while you sit 
under a tree with a book or a pole."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Etie] 
There's no way you can do that and still stay 
in such incredible shape."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Etie] 
So I assume that whatever you're doing on the 
sly really works!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Boucheron] 
All right, listen..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Etie] 
Wait, are you using magic? Unbelievable! 
The lengths you'll go just for some muscles!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Boucheron] 
No! It's nothing like that! In fact, it's nothing 
at all!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Boucheron] 
I'm done arguing with you about this. People 
shouldn't see the prince's retainers quarrelling."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Boucheron] 
Good day, Etie."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Etie] 
Riiiight. That's just what he'd say if he was 
hiding something!"
