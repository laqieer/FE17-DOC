[Ivy] 
Prince Alfred, do you understand the 
implications of what has occurred between us?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
Princess Ivy? Can't say that I do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
That first night, you helped me find the way 
when I was lost."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Ivy] 
The second time, you gave me advice on 
how to find peaceful sleep."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Ivy] 
Much as I am loath to admit it, I am deeply in 
your debt."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alfred] 
Haha, and that's bad somehow?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Ivy] 
Of course it's bad."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Ivy] 
I am the crown princess of Elusia. I cannot show 
such weakness, especially to a rival nation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Ivy] 
Therefore...you must tell me how I can be 
of assistance to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alfred] 
Oh, so you think it should be your turn to help 
me now, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Ivy] 
I need to clear this obligation. That's all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alfred] 
Well, I hate to say it, but I'm not in any kind of a 
jam right now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Ivy] 
So you won't let me help you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Ivy] 
This is unacceptable. I demand that you be 
troubled immediately!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alfred] 
Haha, the only thing that's giving me trouble is 
this demand of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alfred] 
Look, I don't think of this as a ""pay me back 
someday"" situation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alfred] 
This is just what allies do!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Ivy] 
Ugh."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alfred] 
When I see you're in a spot, I help out. You 
don't owe me for that. None of my friends do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Ivy] 
You just...trust people?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Ivy] 
You really are naive."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alfred] 
Guilty as charged. But there's a lot of upsides to 
being naive."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Ivy] 
I suppose...I can find inspiration in that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Ivy] 
Very well. I will trust you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Alfred] 
Aww, Princess Ivy. That's great!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Ivy] 
To be candid, I am glad to have more people 
I can trust now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Ivy] 
When I become queen, it will be a relief to know 
that at least one of my peers is trustworthy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Ivy] 
Thank you, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Ivy] 2 

[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
Princess Ivy, we've got to stop meeting at 
this hour."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Ivy] 
Prince Alfred. Is it not past your bedtime?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alfred] 
Oh, I'm not up late. I just got up early 
this morning."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Ivy] 
I am not sure this hour is sufficiently late to 
qualify as early."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alfred] 
So what are you still doing up, anyway?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Ivy] 
I...couldn't sleep."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alfred] 
I'd think it would be even harder to sleep 
out here, with it being so bright and all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Ivy] 
No, I...prefer it here, actually."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alfred] 
Hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alfred] 
Strong wind tonight, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alfred] 
Sounds like a howling ghost, the way it blows 
through the trees."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Ivy] 
What are you suggesting?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alfred] 
You can be straight with me, Princess Ivy. You 
were scared to be alone in your room, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Ivy] 
How dare you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alfred] 
Hey, there's no shame in it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alfred] 
The wind scared me, too, when I was a kid. I'd 
crawl under the sheets and stay there all night."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Ivy] 
I am no child!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alfred] 
When you get creeped out, think of something 
fun instead. You'll be asleep before you know it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alfred] 
That's what my mother told me. After that, 
I slept like a log every single night."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Ivy] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Ivy] 
I will return to bed. Sleep is restorative to 
one's health, as they say."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alfred] 
Nighty night! Don't let the strong wind fright!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Ivy] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Ivy] 2 

[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
Whatcha doing up so late, Princess Ivy?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Ivy] 
Prince Alfred!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Ivy] 
I suppose it must seem rather suspicious for an 
Elusian to be roaming alone after dark."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Ivy] 
I assure you I have no plans to murder anyone 
or to set anything on fire."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Ivy] 
Of course, such assurances must mean little 
coming from me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alfred] 
Nah, you don't seem so bad. I'm leaning toward 
trusting you by now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
Oh? I am surprised to learn that the crown 
prince of Firene is so naive."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
If that's what I get for trusting people, then 
naive is my middle name."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Ivy] 
Hm. So did you need something from me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Ivy] 
If you were not here to doubt my motives, 
I would expect you to have left by now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alfred] 
Nah. I wouldn't leave you alone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Ivy] 
And why is that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alfred] 
Well, it's pretty plain to see that you're lost."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Ivy] 
You think so?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alfred] 
The Somniel's a big place. Lots of twists and 
turns. It's easy to get confused."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Ivy] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Ivy] 
I do confess I am somewhat lost."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alfred] 
If you're going where I think you're going, 
I know the way. Let me help you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Ivy] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Ivy] 
Thank you."
