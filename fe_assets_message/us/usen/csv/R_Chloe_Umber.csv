[Amber] 
Heeey! Hey, Chloé!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Chloé] 
Hi, Amber. In a good mood today, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Amber] 
Ooo, I sure am. Wait until you hear this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Amber] 
I found another map...and this one leads to a 
forbidden labyrinth!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Amber] 
It's a legendary maze of tunnels and pits that's 
supposed to lead to the other side of the world."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Chloé] 
Unbelievable! Where did you get this map from?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Amber] 
This sweet little street vendor guy said it was─ 
get this─my destiny to buy it from him."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Amber] 
He was grinning the whole time. He must have 
sensed my passion for seeking out legends!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Chloé] 
Hah, I'm sure he did."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Amber] 
Don't worry, Chloé. I won't invite you to join 
me this time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Chloé] 
Oh. How come? Did you not like the lunch 
I prepared for our last adventure?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Amber] 
What? No! That was a really nice meal...once I 
got past the eyeballs."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Amber] 
I just feel like I dragged you on a wild fountain 
chase, y'know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Amber] 
I'm super sure this map is real...but I'll check it 
out myself just to be super, super sure."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Chloé] 
That's too bad. I would have liked to join you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Amber] 
What? You're serious?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Chloé] 
Of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Chloé] 
After all, we're not really out to find some 
mystical, legendary ruin, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Chloé] 
We're out to have a fun time looking for it! 
Just like the heroes in stories."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Amber] 
Whoa! That's exactly why quests are the best. 
You totally get me!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Chloé] 
Sure. I've seen how your eyes sparkle as we 
close in on the X on your map."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Amber] 
In that case... Chloé, would you care to join me 
on another legendary quest?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Chloé] 
Definitely. And this time, I'll pack some extra- 
special lunches for us."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Amber] 
Great! Just, uh...go easy on the folk food, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1

[Chloé] 
Well, I think the spring is lovely. And doesn't 
that cool water feel nice?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Yeah... I guess."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Amber] 
But this isn't the Fountain of Youth!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Chloé] 
Haha, that's all right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Chloé] 
Yes, this is a normal spring, but you're still so 
young. You don't need the Fountain of Youth."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Amber] 
That's not the point. We came here on a quest 
to find a legendary fountain."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Amber] 
I can't believe this stupid map was a fake the 
whole time. Ugh... I'm such a sucker."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Chloé] 
Aww, don't feel down, Amber."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Amber] 
I also can't believe you're so chipper about 
this, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Chloé] 
Even if it's not the Fountain of Youth, I'm happy 
enough to visit such a beautiful spring."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Chloé] 
It's so lovely that it might have inspired the 
tales of the Fountain of Youth to begin with."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Amber] 
Hmm. I guess it is a beautiful little spring..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Chloé] 
Right? So don't be sad. Besides, I packed some 
food we can eat while we take in the scenery."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Amber] 
You did?! Aw, yeah! Good move, Chloé. You 
always think ahead."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Amber] 
Pretty scenery, a tasty lunch... This is turning 
out more like a weekend picnic or something."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Amber] 
Woo! Weekend picnic!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Amber] 
Wait a second."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Amber] 
You... You planned this all along, didn't you? 
You knew this quest would be a dud!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Chloé] 
Hahaha! Does it matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Amber] 
Nah. I'm too hungry to stay mad now. Bring on 
the grub!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Chloé] 
Here you go. One plate of dried fish eyeballs, 
just for you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Amber] 
Aaaugh! One of your funky folk-food lunches? 
Now this quest is definitely a dud..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1

[Amber] 
Chloé! Listen up, I have something that's gonna 
blow your mind!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Chloé] 
Heh, what's got you so riled up?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Amber] 
You've heard of the Fountain of Youth, right? 
Y'know, from those fairy tales you love?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Chloé] 
Oh, those are some of the best stories. But why 
do you ask?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Amber] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Amber] 
Brace yourself... I got my hands on the only map 
to its hidden location!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Chloé] 
Wow... That's unbelievable!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Chloé] 
Especially since the Fountain of Youth isn't real. 
Why would it be on a map?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Amber] 
That's exactly it! That's why this is so amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Amber] 
If it doesn't exist, then why do I have a map 
that shows its precise location?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Amber] 
So? Whaddaya say, Chloé? Wanna join me on a 
quest to find the Fountain of Youth?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Amber] 
You know all about this fairy-tale stuff. If we 
team up, we'll be unstoppable!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Chloé] 
Sure, I'll tag along."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Chloé] 
Maybe on the way, we'll see some nice 
landscapes right out of a fairy tale."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Amber] 
Really?! Great! Thanks!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Amber] 
I can't wait. Let's go find that fountain!"
