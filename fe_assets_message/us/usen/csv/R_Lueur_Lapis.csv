[Lapis] 
Hello, Divine One. I have something for you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
Are these crafting tools?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
Yep! You said you wanted to learn crafting, and 
you can't practice without a set of your own."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Thank you for these."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Lapis] 
I should be thanking you, really."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Lapis] 
I've been down on myself for a long time. 
You helped me shake some of that off."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lapis] 
Your kind words about my crafting skills made 
me feel more confident in myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
Good! You really are amazing, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
I watched you make that weighted pack like it 
was nothing. I still have a lot to learn from you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Lapis] 
OK! I could show you how to make a rake."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
A rake? What would we use that for?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Lapis] 
Harvesting taters."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
Taters."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lapis] 
Yeah! I can make a rake that works on all kinds. 
Potatoes, sweet potatoes, Brodian yams..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
Brodian yams?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lapis] 
Well, Brodia is in the name, but they can grow 
everywhere. I even found a few near here!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Lapis] 
They're so sweet when you boil them... Ugh, 
now I want some. Let's get started on that rake!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
Amazing. Like I said, I still have a lot to learn 
from you, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Lapis] 
Huh?! You're serious? You really want to train 
with me today, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
Yes! I thought it would be nice to work together 
every once in a while."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lapis] 
That's so exciting! Thank you for carving out 
the time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
So, what am I in for, Lapis? What's your usual 
training regimen?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lapis] 
I start with some drills using different weapons, 
try a few practice swings...then do heavy lifting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Lapis] 
I strap a weighted pack to my back and go for 
a long run. Sometimes I climb a mountain."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
That...seems like it would build up an incredible 
amount of endurance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lapis] 
Oh, if you're going to train with me, you'll need 
a pack too. I'll make you one real quick!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
You're going to make a weighted pack?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Lapis] 
Sure! It's not too hard. I had to make most 
things by hand back in the countryside."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
Countryside?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lapis] 
Ah!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Lapis] 
Ahh! I...I meant, ""can't decide!"" I can't decide, 
uh, whether to make you a pack or not!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
Oh. Well, I'd love it if you did. I think it's really 
amazing you can make those kinds of things."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lapis] 
Ooh, please don't tease me like that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
I'm not teasing. Your crafting skills could be 
very useful on the battlefield."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
Would you be willing to teach me how to make 
a few things? I'd like to learn."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Lapis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Lapis] 
It feels...strange to be complimented for such 
a modest skill."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Lapis] 
But yes, I can show you how to make a pack 
right now. Watch closely!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alear] 
All right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alear] 
Whoa! Your hands move so fast! Can we, uh, 
go back a few steps?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Alear] 
Oh, Lapis! I wanted to thank you for all of your 
support in our recent battles."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
Oh, I didn't really do much out there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Lapis] 
I was just following your lead. You don't have 
to thank me for that, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Lapis] 
There were lots of other, more skilled warriors 
in those battles. You should thank them instead."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
Lapis, please. You're strong and you think fast. 
You should have confidence in your abilities."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lapis] 
Confidence? I don't know about that..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lapis] 
I'm thrilled to be a retainer, but everyone else 
is much more qualified. I'm not even a noble."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Lapis] 
I wouldn't want to sound arrogant when I rank 
so far beneath everyone else."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
Wow. You're pretty hard on yourself, huh? 
I guess that can be a good motivator..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
But you shouldn't compare yourself to others 
like that. Everyone has different skills."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
Be a little more kind to yourself, OK? Like I said, 
you've earned a bit of confidence."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lapis] 
But... Well, Divine One, I... I'm not sure what to 
say to all of that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Lapis] 
I'm not used to being complimented like this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lapis] 
I should go. Please excuse me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
Lapis sounds so sure that she doesn't really 
belong here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
There has to be some way to help her work 
past that mindset."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Lapis] 2 

[Alear] 
Hello, Lapis. Do you have a moment?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Lapis] 
Sure, Divine One! What can I do for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
Well...I want you to have this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Lapis] 
Wow. What is this? The metalwork is beautiful. 
It looks all fancy and expensive... Ah! Wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Lapis] 
Is... Is this the Pact Ring?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
It is. Look at the back side."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Lapis] 
Why is my name engraved here?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
I carved it there using the crafting tools you 
gave me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Lapis] 
What? You did this to the ring yourself? Using 
the tools I made for you?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Lapis] 
Ahh, an engraving like this can't be removed! 
Why did you do this?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
I have no intention of undoing it. I carved your 
name into it because I want you to have it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
What do you say, Lapis? Will you wear the 
Pact Ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Lapis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Lapis] 
You know, there was a time when a situation 
like this would've had me fleeing in shame..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Lapis] 
But...I care about you, Divine One. And it 
doesn't matter what anyone else thinks."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
Does that mean..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Lapis] 
Of course. I will accept this ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Lapis] 
You took such care in carving my name into it... 
How could I possibly say no after that?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Lapis. I'm so glad."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Lapis] 
Um... I actually have something important to tell 
you, Divine One. You see, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
You're from a village of yam farmers, right? 
Way out in the Brodian countryside?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Lapis] 
Huh? How did you know that?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
I read up on Brodian yams. It's just a nickname. 
The only people who call them that are..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Lapis] 
Yam farmers. Ugh. My secret is out...but I think 
I'm glad. That's a big part of who I am."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
Indeed. And I'm giving you the Pact Ring 
because of who you are, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Lapis] 
Thank you, Divine Dragon ..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Lapis] 
You'll be safe with me. It turns out we're both 
pretty crafty...so let's carve out a better world!"
