[Amber] 
Hey, Merrin. I'm really sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Merrin] 
Why are you apologizing to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Amber] 
It's about our sparring match the other day. 
I really did trip, and I really did lose to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
You did?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Amber] 
It wasn't a covert strategy or a pratfall. I just... 
fell because I was being careless."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Amber] 
That happens a lot. I'm actually pretty clumsy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Amber] 
I stumble into everything, including my role as a 
knight of Brodia. It's all dumb luck!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Merrin] 
I don't believe that. Not for one minute."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Merrin] 
I'm from a small village too, so I know how hard 
you must have worked to get where you are."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Merrin] 
No one is named retainer to a crown prince 
without a tremendous amount of effort."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Merrin] 
You may be uncoordinated, but I have no 
doubt you're an excellent knight, Amber."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Amber] 
That's...that's very encouraging to hear... 
Thank you, Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Amber] 
I should really be learning from you, y'know? 
Can we do some more training together?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Merrin] 
Of course. I'd be honored to train with a knight 
from the kingdom of Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Amber] 
Yes! I can't wait to get started!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Amber] 
With your help, I'll get rid of my clumsiness and 
become a respectable knight in no time!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Merrin] 
It seems to me, the secret to a Brodian's 
strength is that earnest attitude of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Merrin] 
Hehe, I think I'm going to learn a thing or two 
from you, my friend."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Amber! I was hoping you'd teach me the secret 
to that Brodian strength of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
It's not much of a secret. Like I said earlier, it 
was mostly physical labor back on the ranch."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Merrin] 
Huh... It sounds like building up endurance is 
important, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Amber] 
Oh, for sure. The higher your endurance, the 
longer you can train!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Merrin] 
I see. Very helpful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Merrin] 
And to think, one can build up this endurance 
caring for alpacas. It's a dream come true!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Merrin] 
I wish we had alpacas in my country."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Amber] 
Don't worry, Merrin. If you wanna get strong, 
I can teach you everything I know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Merrin] 
You can? You will?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Amber] 
You bet! Where do you want to start? Running? 
Maybe some core exercises?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Merrin] 
Why don't we spar together...just to see how 
much endurance I have right now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Amber] 
Oh, good idea! It'll be nice to have a new 
sparring partner."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Merrin] 
I doubt I'll be a match for you. I'll just have to 
do my best and hope I don't embarrass myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Amber] 
Aw, maaan..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Merrin] 
I can't believe it. I won so...easily."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Amber] 
I can't believe I tripped over myself. I wasn't 
even attacking! I'm so pathetic..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Merrin] 
Wait...you're lulling me into dropping my guard, 
aren't you? Distracting me with pratfalls again?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Amber] 
Sorry, Merrin, but I'm gonna call it. Lesson's 
over for today, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Merrin] 
Oh, OK. Another time, then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Amber, I have a question. How does a knight 
from the kingdom of Brodia train?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Amber] 
Why do you want to know about that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Merrin] 
To be honest, I've always admired Brodian 
knights, and I'm just curious..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Merrin] 
Your country is called the kingdom of warriors, 
so your training methods must be extraordinary."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Amber] 
We do crank out a lot of strong warriors, but 
I think that's due to the terrain..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Amber] 
Most of Brodia is just cliffs and ravines. It's not 
great for traditional farming, y'know?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Amber] 
The focus in many villages is on mining and 
such, so folks tend to grow sturdy and strong."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Merrin] 
I see! So strength training is just part of daily 
life, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Amber] 
For most people, yeah! I grew up on an alpaca 
ranch, so my daily chores were a bit different."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Merrin] 
Alpacas?! Those rare critters of notoriety?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Merrin] 
That's fantastic! I adore critters with all my 
heart─rare ones especially!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Merrin] 
If you worked on a ranch, you must know all 
about them. Please, tell me what you know!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Amber] 
Well, first off, alpacas are super fluffy... But 
also? They're really cute."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Amber] 
There is a lot of spitting, though. You have to 
watch out for that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Merrin] 
Spitting?! Magnificent! I'm sure I wouldn't 
mind alpaca spit one bit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Amber] 
Trust me, you would. It takes forever to get 
the smell out of your clothes. Or hair."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Amber] 
I don't mean to brag, but I've become an expert 
alpaca-spit dodger."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Amber] 
Hah! Hoowah! That's just a couple of your basic 
spit-evasion moves..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Amber] 
Wha─ Ah! AAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Amber] 
Aw, why do rocks always sabotage my 
cool moves?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Merrin] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Merrin] 
I'd expect nothing less from a Brodian knight! 
Very impressive."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Amber] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Merrin] 
Brodian knights aren't just strong, they're spry 
enough to pull off a pratfall. Well played!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025,"[Merrin] 
You really must teach me the secret to your 
strength sometime soon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026,"[Amber] 
Uh, you enjoyed that? Then...yeah, that was all 
planned! I am the picture of strength and agility."
