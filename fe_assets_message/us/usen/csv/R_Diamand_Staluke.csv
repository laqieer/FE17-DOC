[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Ah, bullseye. That's good! I'll do 50 more, 
just like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
You really are skilled with a bow, you 
know that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Diamant? How long have you been watching?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Diamant] 
Long enough to see that archery is definitely 
one of your strengths."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alcryst] 
Thank you...but there's still plenty of room 
for improvement."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alcryst] 
I need to train more. I want to grow stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Diamant] 
There it is! That's the right attitude. I knew my 
little brother had it in him."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alcryst] 
Diamant, may I... May I challenge you to an 
archery contest? If you have the time?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Diamant] 
Ha! That sounds like my kind of fun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Diamant] 
What's the challenge? Most bullseyes out of 
10 wins?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alcryst] 
That sounds good to me. Let's begin!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Diamant] 
Alcryst... I'm shocked. I knew you were a 
skilled archer, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alcryst] 
What are you talking about? You scored nine 
over my miserable eight. I've been defeated..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alcryst] 
Heaping praise on your brother after soundly 
defeating him at his own contest? What a bully."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Diamant] 
Ha! I'm not going to let my baby brother win. 
If you want to beat me, you have to beat me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alcryst] 
Heh heh, I should have expected nothing less 
from the crown prince of Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alcryst] 
I wish you knew how reassuring it is to have 
an older brother like you, Diamant. I'm lucky."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Diamant] 
I'm lucky to have you as a brother, too, Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Diamant] 
No other challenger has ever been as skilled and 
polite as you─archer or otherwise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alcryst] 
I'll just have to train more and grow stronger. 
When I'm ready, I'll come looking for a rematch."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Diamant] 
You're on. But be warned, my own training 
won't slow down. I'll be stronger as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alcryst] 
I have no doubt that you will, Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alcryst] 
I'm behind you for now, but I will catch up. 
No. Better than that─I'll surpass you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Alcryst] 
And whatever else happens...I will always 
protect you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Diamant] 
Hm? What was that last bit, Alcryst?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Alcryst] 
Just talking to myself. Don't worry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Diamant] 
Ngh...not good enough. I can't protect the 
kingdom like this..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alcryst] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Diamant?! Are you OK? You're drenched in 
sweat. What happened to you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Diamant] 
Alcryst... You're not supposed to see me 
like this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Diamant] 
I'm fine. Don't worry. I was just doing some 
focused training with a few of our mages."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alcryst] 
I've never seen training wipe you out like this..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alcryst] 
You might have some kind of illness. We should 
get a doctor in here to check your─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Diamant] 
I'm not ill."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Diamant] 
Alcryst... Do you remember when you asked 
if I have any weaknesses?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Diamant] 
Now you know. This is my weakness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Your weakness is...training with mages? 
I don't understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Diamant] 
As a boy, I made a careless mistake while 
handling magic. Had a serious injury for a while."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Diamant] 
Ever since then...I've been afraid of magic."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alcryst] 
You? Afraid?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Diamant] 
That's right. Now I work like this every day to 
overcome that fear and conquer my weakness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Diamant] 
That's why training with these mages is 
so important."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alcryst] 
I always thought you were flawless..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Diamant] 
No one is flawless. I have to train like this every 
single day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Diamant] 
Alcryst. You must not speak of this to anyone. 
Do you understand?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alcryst] 
I won't tell a soul."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Diamant] 
I should get back to it. I don't like to keep the 
mages waiting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alcryst] 
Diamant, you don't need to push yourself so 
hard."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Diamant] 
We're Brodia's protectors. It's our duty to grow 
stronger in every way we can."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alcryst] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Diamant] 
Talking with you has settled my nerves a bit. 
I'll be fine. Don't worry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Diamant] 

[Alcryst] 
But, Diamant..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Alcryst] 
He's afraid of something. My brother has 
a weakness. I can't believe it..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Alcryst] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Thanks for asking me to be your training 
partner today, Diamant. It means a lot."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Diamant] 
Of course. We are brothers, after all. A bit of 
roughhousing is expected of us."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 
I can't offer an even match─my skills pale in 
comparison to yours─but I'll learn what I can."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Diamant] 
We all have our own strengths and weaknesses. 
Constant self-deprecation counts as the latter."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alcryst] 
It's not self-deprecation. It's the truth. How am 
I supposed to win against the prince of Brodia?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Diamant] 
You are a prince of Brodia, Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alcryst] 
Yes, I am a Brodian prince, but I'm not THE 
Brodian prince. I'm not you, Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Diamant] 
That's an awful way to think about it. Is that 
how you talk when I'm not around?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Diamant] 
You can't bring that lack of confidence to 
the battlefield."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Diamant] 
Enemies much stronger than you will be waiting 
out there. Don't offer them your weakness."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Yes, Diamant... I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Diamant] 
We need to get you in the right mindset for 
battle. Let's focus on your strengths."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Diamant] 
You're a skilled archer, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alcryst] 
People say that, sure, but I'm actually not 
very good..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Diamant] 
Stop. That's your lack of confidence talking. 
Did you hear what I said about weakness?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Do you have any weaknesses, Diamant?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Diamant] 
Ha! Good question. What do you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alcryst] 
I can't spot a single one. You're flawless."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Diamant] 
Well, you certainly won't find any if we don't 
start training. Let's build Brodia a better future!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Yes, Diamant..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Alcryst] 
For Brodia's future, I'll do the best I can."
