MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,Ciao!
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,It's so pretty out!
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,I know...
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004,You and me should kick back and relax.
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,"♪Oh, Divine Dragon, my dear...♪"
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002,"♪I see you slumbering here! You'll miss the 
whole day...I fear!♪"
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,Lalala─ Oh!
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,You're up!
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,"Well, it looks like I got here early, so..."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004,Wanna go for a walk with me?
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Hmm...I can't believe you slept through 
my singing!"
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,You must find it soothing.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,Funny. Mom flies awake after one verse.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,Morning!
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,"You knew who it was, didn't ya?"
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,"I mean, how could you not?"
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004,"We make an amazing team, after all!"
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,Guess who?
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002,I'll be impressed if you can figure it out.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,Ta-da!
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,"The one and only Timerra, of course!"
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,Your good ol' bandit-fightin' pal.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004,"But you knew right away, didn't ya?"
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,Maybe you need more clues.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,"Well, you and I fought some bandits the 
other day."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,We were totally surrounded.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004,"But we totally beat 'em, of course."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,"Haha... Uh, nope, not at all."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,No meat roasting here.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,"C'mon, let's go get some food."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004,I'm starving!
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,Running over here made me hungry.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002,"I'll just make myself a snack while I wait 
for you to wakey-wakey."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,Morning!
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,Good thing you're up!
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,"I was about to get a bonfire going and grill 
up some meat!"
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Just gonna light a teensy fire, put the meat 
on, and..."
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,"Oh, look at that! Grilled to perfection!"
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,Oh... OH NO! This fire is HUGE!
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004,Water! I've gotta throw some water on it! Hyah!
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,You're up!
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,"OK, before we defeat our enemies, we have 
to defeat this huge pile o' meat!"
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,No leftovers!
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004,No wasting!
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,"Divine One, I need your help! I grilled up 
way too much meat!"
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,Sorry.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,It's just...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,everyone's stuffed!
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004,Only your stomach can save us!
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,I'm serious...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,I need you to help me eat it all.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,And no...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004,"I'm not trying to trick you into helping me 
raid a bandit hideout."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,"♪Ooo, Divine One! You just woke up in time!♪"
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,"Haha, sorry!"
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,"That was loud. But hey, good morning!"
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,"Ciao, Divine One! It's a beautiful day!"
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,Yes! You're up!
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,"Ready for action, I see."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003,That's the kinda commander we need!
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,Am I early?
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,"I'll just sing a little something while I wait. 
Ahem!"
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,♪Morning time! Here's the sunshine!♪
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004,"♪Dream on, O great dragon divine!♪"
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,"Yay, you woke up!"
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,Let's find some tasty grub!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,"Ooo, you know what I really want?"
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004,Extra helpings!
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,"I'm starving! C'mon, Divine One, let's go 
get something to eat!"
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002,"Oh, you're asleep..."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,"Yay, you're up!"
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,"C'mon, chow time!"
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,"Ugh, I'm always so hungry, you know?"
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004,Hah! Probably 'cause I never sit still.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,I know...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,I'm gonna whisper in your ear.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,"Grilled meat, deep-fried fish..."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004,"freshly baked bread, juicy fruit, cake lathered 
in frosting..."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,Morning!
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,Just so you know...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,"you are amazing, and being here with you 
is heavenly."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004,"Oh, and even when I'm the queen of Solm..."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005,"I hope I can wish you good morning like this 
every single day."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,"It's me, Divine One! I bet you could tell from my 
beautiful voice, right?"
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,Good morning!
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,"Yeah, I can't start my day without seeing 
that incredible face of yours."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,"So, let's make it through the day in one piece."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004,"That way I can say good morning to you 
tomorrow too."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Hehe, don't wake up if you don't want to."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,This is really nice too.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,I just wish we could go on like this forever.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,My lifetime though...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,"Well, let's just say I'll be leaving the party 
first, ya know?"
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,"But hey, if I disappear..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007,"make sure you get up in the mornings, OK?"
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Morning!
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,Now that I've seen you...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,I'm off to train.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,I think you're amazing!
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#005,And I hope...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#006,you feel the same. Always.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,I've been dying to see you!
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002,So I won't apologize if I wake you up.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,"Hehe, maybe I should have waited."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,But you and I are connected now.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,"And you told me I was free to see you whenever 
I liked."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,And I liked now.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,"The thing is, you giving me the Pact Ring..."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,"I never thought it would give me so 
much freedom."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,"Now that I have it, I can lend you my strength."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,And I can come and go whenever I choose.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,But...it's funny.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,I have all this freedom.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007,"And yet, I just want to be near you."
