[Saphir] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Thank you for teaching me to cook, Saphir."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Under your guidance, I managed to prepare a 
complete fish dinner."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alcryst] 
When it's safe for Mother to return, I'll be able 
to welcome her back with a home-cooked meal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
My pleasure, really."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Saphir] 
I'm happy to pass on all the lessons my parents 
taught me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Saphir] 
And I think they'd have loved to know their 
knowledge would benefit their prince someday."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Saphir] 
Come to think of it, I wish I could tell 'em about 
the time I got to cook for King Morion too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alcryst] 
Did you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alcryst] 
Heh heh... If he were still with us, I'm sure he'd 
help himself to several platefuls."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Saphir] 
Ah, sorry to bring up a sore subject..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alcryst] 
It's all right. I can tell it's a fond memory."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alcryst] 
I'm happy that there are stories I've never heard 
from people who knew him."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Saphir] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alcryst] 
Saphir? What's the matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Saphir] 
It hurts me too. Losing him."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Saphir] 
When I stayed behind at Brodia castle, I took 
it for granted he'd be back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Saphir] 
Now every so often, it hits me that I'll never 
see his face again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Saphir] 
Best I can do is hold tight to the memory."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alcryst] 
I know exactly what you mean."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Saphir] 
I'm sorry, Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Saphir] 
I know my sorrow is nothing compared to what 
you and Prince Diamant must feel."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alcryst] 
Sorrow isn't something that should be 
measured...or compared."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alcryst] 
I know you shared a special bond with my 
father as a royal soldier of Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alcryst] 
It's important that we all take time to grieve. 
I know I am...and I hope you will too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Saphir] 
Kind words."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alcryst] 
We should prepare a plate for Father someday. 
We've yet to erect a headstone, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Alcryst] 
I'm sure he'd appreciate a hearty meal left at his 
final resting place. He did love to eat, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Saphir] 
Great idea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Saphir] 
Yeah, let's do it. Let's leave him a feast fit for 
a king."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Saphir] 
Thanks, Prince Alcryst. I feel better already."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Saphir] 2 

[Saphir] 
Turns out you're quite the fisherman, Prince 
Alcryst! This is a huge haul."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
I must admit, I'm surprised myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Saphir] 
It's your quiet disposition. Those fish never saw 
you coming."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Do you think we have enough fish to prepare a 
full meal?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Saphir] 
Definitely. This'll do nicely, trust me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alcryst] 
That's exciting! I can't wait to learn... We'll get 
started as soon as we return, right, Saphir?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Saphir] 
Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Saphir] 
So, are you gonna tell me who you're so excited 
to cook for, or what?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alcryst] 
Heh heh... Was it that obvious?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Saphir] 
I noticed you get most excited when you've 
got someone else in mind."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Well...it's for my mother."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alcryst] 
I want to prepare something special for her once 
this war ends, and fish is her favorite food."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Saphir] 
Ah."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alcryst] 
When we heard of the Fell Dragon's return, she 
moved to a secure palace far from the throne."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alcryst] 
It feels like it's been so long... I want to treat 
her to something special when we're reunited."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alcryst] 
It's the least I can do. I'm sure she's already 
learned about...Father..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Saphir] 
Mm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Saphir] 
Well, Prince Alcryst, you can count on me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Saphir] 
I'll teach you everything I know about making 
fish taste wonderful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Saphir] 
We'll start with how to fillet and sear, and then 
move on to seasoning and preservation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Saphir] 
Gotta warn you ahead of time, though. When it 
comes to cooking, I'm a strict instructor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alcryst] 
Heh heh, uh-oh. I'll be sure to brace myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Saphir] 2 

[Saphir] 
All right! Great hunting today. Well done."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Saphir] 
Couldn't have brought in nearly this much if not 
for you, Prince Alcryst. Thanks for coming."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Oh, but I barely helped. This is mostly your 
handiwork, Saphir."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Saphir] 
Hahaha! Humble as ever, I see!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Saphir] 
Now that we're good on meat for a while, 
I think it's going to be fishing next time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Saphir] 
Care to join me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alcryst] 
Me? I don't have much experience with fishing..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Saphir] 
You'll be fine. I'll show you how it's done."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alcryst] 
I'd feel bad for the fish. Imagine getting yanked 
out of the water by someone as useless as me..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Saphir] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Saphir] 
Pretty sure the last thing a fish cares about is 
who's doing the catching. You'll be fine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alcryst] 
I also doubt I'll catch anything. Any bait I offer 
is bound to be inferior─not worth a nibble."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Saphir] 
Nonsense. Stick with me and I promise you'll 
get plenty."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Saphir] 
But the real fun comes when I show you how to 
cook 'em."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alcryst] 
You'll teach me how to cook fish? Really?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alcryst] 
In that case...perhaps I will give it a try."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Saphir] 
That's what I like to hear. Consider yourself 
invited next time I head out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alcryst] 
Yes, please! Thank you, Saphir."
