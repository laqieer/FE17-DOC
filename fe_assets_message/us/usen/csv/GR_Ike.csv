MID_GR_Alfred_A_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Alfred] 
Feels like I bulked up a ton after all the fights 
we've been through! What do you think?"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Ike] 
If you did, I haven't noticed. Sorry."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
No, don't apologize. I really like your bluntness!"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Ike] 
Well, my friends keep telling me I should be 
more considerate. Glad it's not a problem."
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Alfred] 
Say, uh, can you teach me how to get muscles 
like those?"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Ike] 
There's not much to teach. Train every day and 
eat meat. I don't know that it helps, but I like it."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Alfred] 
So you're the Emblem from Solm's ring, huh? 
Gotta say, those are some world-class muscles!"
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Ike] 
""World class""? That's the first time I've heard 
that one."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Anna] 
I found a pretty gem, and I'm thinking of having 
a festival to celebrate it. Are you in?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Sorry, you're having a festival to celebrate... 
what exactly?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Anna] 
Ike! I need people to put this thing together! 
If you don't help, I'm gonna cry!"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Ike] 
OK, I'll do whatever you need. Just...just 
don't cry."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Got a minute, Anna? I might be in the market 
for something."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Anna] 
Hey, it's not Anna, it's Lady Anna between 
friends! Call me ""lady"" or keep your mouth shut!"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Now there's a kid running around selling stuff?"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Anna] 
Not ""stuff,"" but the finest of wares! Take a good 
look, and maybe you'll see something you like!"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Uh oh. That look on your face means 
something's up. What's going on, Bunet?"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
I am attempting to create a meat dish that 
will satisfy you. But I fear it is...challenging."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Ike] 
Bunet, like I told you before, I'm an Emblem. 
Emblems can't eat."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Bunet] 
That's why I'm creating a dish that doesn't have 
to be eaten to be satisfying, especially for you."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Bunet] 
Ike, I'm quite curious... What type of food do 
you most enjoy?"
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Ike] 
Well, I'm an Emblem, so no food for me. But 
in my world, I was all about those meat dishes."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Bunet] 
Ike, your strength is like a fine cut of meat. 
I just wish I could eat it to absorb your qualities."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Ike] 
I can't tell if that's a compliment or a joke."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You seemed lost earlier. What's your plan if we 
have to fight in a forest?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
It's no problem. I'll just follow my friends."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Although if I lose track of them too... Hmm. 
Guess I'll just deal with it when it happens."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Ike] 
And if we get surrounded? Maybe you'd better 
stick close to me."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Isn't that the same book I saw you reading 
last time? Don't you get tired of it?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Nah. It's a classic for a reason. If you're 
interested, I could read it to you."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You look pretty stern there. Brushing up on 
your tactics?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
No, I'm reading the tale of a knight. It's pretty 
inspiring stuff."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
More training today, Princess? You're pretty 
committed."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Céline] 
There are times when bloodshed is necessary 
to protect one's people."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Céline] 
When those times come, I cannot stand by 
and leave this dirty business to our soldiers."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Ike] 
A princess on the front line, huh? You're not the 
first I've known. Your subjects must love you."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Céline] 
Tell me, Ike, what do you think of enforcing 
peace through battle?"
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I think there are some people who want a fight. 
I don't feel bad giving it to 'em."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Céline] 
What lovely weather we're having today. If only 
I could remain here and gaze at the skies."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Sounds nice. Too bad every day can't be 
like this."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Chloé] 
I hope you're not working too hard just because 
so many people are counting on you, Ike."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Ike] 
I appreciate the concern. But I wouldn't worry."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Ike] 
I seek out the tough foes because I like to. 
Guess that might seem odd to folks, though."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Chloé] 
If you say so! But just so you know, if you ever 
feel overwhelmed, you can always tell me."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
What's with the food you're always eating?"
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
I just like folk foods. It's too bad I can't share 
any with you."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Chloé] 
A big, strong hero coming out of a ring to lend 
his aid... It's the perfect start to a fairy tale!"
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Maybe if it was some prince or something. 
I'm no fairy-tale hero."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I enjoy your company, Ike. You must let me 
treat you to something. What would you like?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Nothing particular comes to mind."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
It can be anything! The sky is the limit."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Ike] 
In that case, I suppose you could help me 
practice smiling."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Citrinne] 
They say that a good smile is contagious, you 
know. You should try smiling more often!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Ike] 
OK. I'll try that sometime."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Citrinne] 
You have such spirit, Ike! You're a true hero. 
Would you be willing to train me in combat?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Ike] 
I usually train alone. I might not be the best 
teacher, but I'll do what I can."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Clanne] 
Say...Lord Ike? Would it be OK with you if I 
came along to today's training session?"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Feel free. But can you keep up physically? 
I don't want to hurt you."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
Of course! I want to get stronger so I can help 
everyone who needs me."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Ike] 
All right, then. Let's see if you can keep up 
until the end."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Clanne] 
Lord Ike, are you going off to train now?"
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I've been training since I was a kid. It's a habit, 
and if I don't do it, I just can't relax."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
As a servant of the Divine Dragon, are you OK 
with fighting beside me instead?"
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
There's no concern. Serving with you is a 
high honor indeed, Lord Ike!"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Diamant] 
Improving my kingdom, surpassing my father as 
king... I'm not sure I can actually do all of that."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Don't worry about can or can't. You just have 
to do it."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Ike] 
That's what dedicated training is for, right? 
To make sure you reach your goals?"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Diamant] 
That's exactly right. Haha, I like talking to 
you, Ike."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Diamant] 
You use some impressive sword techniques, Ike. 
Would you be willing to teach me?"
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I learned them from my father. I can teach them 
to you, but they'll be hard to master."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Diamant] 
The rumors of a powerful Emblem in Solm were 
no joke. You're impressive on the battlefield."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Thanks, but I'm just another soldier. I've had a 
bit more training than others, that's all."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Etie] 
You know, if everyone in the world just trained 
more, there'd be no more war."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Ike] 
How does that work?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Etie] 
I feel great after a good exercise. If everyone felt 
like that all the time, what's left to fight over?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Ike] 
I'm not sure that makes sense. But if everyone 
thought it did, maybe it could work."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Etie] 
Question for you, Ike. What kind of supplements 
do you use to get such muscle definition?"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I don't know what those are. I eat meat. I don't 
know if that matters, but there you go."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You're small, but you got some muscle on you."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Etie] 
Thanks for noticing! All that intense training 
day in and day out must be paying off."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Fogado] 
We've met so many new people, and yet we've 
gone so long without a party. Boring, right?"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Ike] 
This isn't a time for parties. Once there's peace, 
then you can throw your parties or whatever."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
My parties? Please, you're not getting out of 
this. You will be getting a raging welcome party."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Ike] 
Better serve some amazing meat dishes, then. 
I can't eat 'em, but I'll enjoy smelling 'em!"
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Fogado] 
You know, in general, you are as cool as they 
get. But in battle, you are extra cool!"
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I'm not any kind of expert on ""cool,"" but if I had 
to guess, I'd wager you're the real king of cool."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Fogado] 
Gotta say, it's strange to think someone as 
serious as you spent all that time in our castle."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Huh, wasn't strange to me. I used to travel with 
these mercenaries. It felt a lot like that."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Framme] 
Um, Lord Ike, do you mind me tagging along 
with you so much?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Ike] 
I like it, actually. It reminds me of when I used 
to hang out with a band of mercenaries."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Framme] 
Whew! I was worried. It's just you hardly ever 
smile, ya know?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Ike] 
Haha, sorry to worry you. My friends used to 
tell me my social skills needed some work."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Framme] 
Lord Ike, I've just gotta ask, what was life like 
inside that ring?"
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I can't say for sure. I think I was asleep mostly. 
But I feel like I dreamed about past battles."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Framme] 
Lord Ike! Oh my gosh... Um, can I get your 
autograph?"
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Sorry, but...I can't actually hold a pen."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Goldmary] 
It must be difficult for you to spend so much 
time around me and not develop...feelings."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Ike] 
I don't know what to say to that."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Ike] 
You have earned my trust, though, Goldmary. 
I guess trust is a feeling."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Goldmary] 
I knew it. I'm so glad. Thank you."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I hope you don't mind sparring with someone 
as devastatingly charming as me, Ike."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Ike] 
Sparring...like with weapons? Not sure I get 
how charm figures into that, but I don't mind."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Hello, Ike. I'm sorry if you find my charisma 
totally overwhelming."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Please tell me this isn't how everyone in your 
kingdom talks."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Hortensia] 
When all this is over, I hope we can rebuild 
Elusia."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Ike] 
It won't ever be exactly like it was."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Ike] 
But the sooner we bring peace to the world, 
the sooner we can get a fresh start."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Know what? You're right! I'm gonna give it 
everything I've got, Ike. You'll see."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Say, Ike. You haven't seen anyone around here 
more adorable than me, have you?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I'm not a great judge of that sort of thing. 
Your work ethic's impressive, though."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Hortensia] 
You're a handsome fellow, Ike. Being seen with 
you can only make me look good."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Not sure I see how, but thanks, I think."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Ivy] 
Tell me─as the leader of a mercenary company, 
how did you handle issues of trust?"
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Once I trust folks, I don't question their motives. 
Even if they lie to me, I figure there's a reason."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
I will remember that. Should you ever deceive 
me...I do not think I'd mind."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Ike] 
Likewise, Ivy. I trust you."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Stop me if I'm out of line, but you seem to be 
taking too much responsibility on yourself."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Ivy] 
You're quite direct, aren't you? It's oddly 
comforting, I must admit."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You don't seem too comfortable around me. 
Was it something I said?"
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Ivy] 
It's not that. Rather, as with those from Solm, 
I don't quite know how to speak to you."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Jade] 
Sir Ike, have you ever known anyone with a 
quirky personality? I need new character ideas."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Quirky? Let me think... I fought alongside a 
gambler once. He was always drowning in debt."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Jade] 
Interesting. Did that ever cause any problems 
having a gambling addict join your ranks?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Ike] 
It did. But even our most troublesome allies 
proved worthy of defending over time."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You look a bit angry, Jade. Is everything OK?"
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Jade] 
I'm fine. I'm just smiling. Is it that hard to tell?"
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Jade] 
I feel at ease around you, Sir Ike. I'm not 
entirely sure why."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Ike] 
I guess we both prefer to skip idle chatter... 
Except for right now, that is."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Jean] 
How come you're always paying so much 
attention to me, Ike?"
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Ike] 
I just respect anyone who can treat wounds. 
If it bothers you, I'll stop."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Jean] 
Oh, it's no bother. I just get a little self- 
conscious about it, that's all."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Ike] 
You know what it is? My little sis was a healer. 
I guess you remind me of her a bit."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You must be some kid to be a doctor already."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Jean] 
My age won't matter to a patient. I want to be 
a great doctor, and there's no time to waste."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Jean] 
Hmm. I didn't notice in battle, but Emblems are 
pretty big up close."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Ike] 
That's not an Emblem thing. I'm just huge."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
You commanded many mercenaries, yes? 
They must have been very strong."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Yeah. We had a mage who could command the 
winds, a sniper with godlike aim... Strong folks."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
If you are saying it, then they must have been! 
Will you tell me about all of your fighters?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Ike] 
Sure. I'll start with an adviser I had─one of the 
toughest people I've ever known."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Ike! I have not seen you since our last battle! 
Where have you been, my dear friend?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Ike] 
""Dear friend,"" huh? Guess there are worse 
things you could call me."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
I studied you in our last battle, Ike. Your sword 
technique is unusual, but it has great power."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Thanks. My father taught me everything I know."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Lapis] 
I can't believe we've both hunted bears before! 
In every other way, we're still so different."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Lapis] 
I wish I had even a shred of your confidence. 
I get so worried about losing in battle."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Ike] 
I'm not that confident, really. I just act before 
I overthink anything."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Ike] 
Don't worry, Lapis. Just trust your instincts out 
there. If you stumble, I'll be right beside you."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Lapis] 
I need an ice breaker... So, have you ever had 
bear meat? It's pretty tasty! Or so I've heard..."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Ike] 
Yeah! Bear meat tastes great! We were hired to 
hunt them often, so I used to eat a lot of it."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Lapis] 
I'm a bit nervous, saying this out loud, but... 
Ike? Thank you for saving me earlier."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Ike] 
You don't have to thank me. You're really 
strong. I'm not sure you actually needed it."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Lindon] 
Why is mankind doomed to make mistake 
after mistake?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Ike] 
I hear you. But people aren't perfect. Mistakes 
are how we learn."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
I see your point. If only what we learned was 
always for good..."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Ike] 
That's where you and me come in. Me with my 
sword, and you with your pen."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Lindon] 
Magic has many subtleties. The more you learn, 
the more uses you can find for it."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Ike] 
People come up with new sword techniques all 
the time too. There's never a dull moment."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
What was that noise?! Are we under attack?!"
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Lindon] 
Hm? Oh, the thunder spell just now? That was 
me doing a little cooking."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Louis] 
I suppose not everything in this world can go 
entirely to plan."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Problems, Louis?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Louis] 
I tried my utmost to keep my people-watching 
discreet, but my friends spotted me regardless."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Ike] 
That sounds weird. But if you care about being 
discreet, I can tell you about a spy I once knew."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Louis] 
Now who should I pair you with, were I to plan 
a social engagement? Perhaps Prince Alfred..."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Ike] 
Yeah, he's an interesting one. I wouldn't mind 
going head to head with him."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Louis] 
Out of curiosity, Ike, does it move you to see 
a group socializing in harmony?"
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Huh? I like it when people get along, if that's 
what you mean."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You've gotten better. Your form's improved a 
lot compared to the way it was."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Alear] 
I owe it to all the lessons I've soaked up from 
you and the others."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Ike] 
No, it was mostly you. All we did was give you 
a push."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Thank you all the same. You've all made me feel 
like I have a chance to bring peace to the world."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Alear] 
I still don't feel strong enough. Ike, would you 
mind a hands-on lesson?"
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I'm not much of a teacher, but I'll try. Be ready, 
though. I don't know how to hold back."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Alear] 
Can we count on you to help us as we try to 
bring peace to this world?"
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Rest easy. I'm a mercenary. When I take a job, 
I make sure it's done."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Mauvier] 
A smile has returned to Lady Veyle's face. 
Soon my duty will come to an end."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Ike] 
You believe you have been by her side because 
it's your duty? No. You chose to stand there."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Ike] 
You need Veyle as much as she needs you. 
Shouldn't you see this through to the end?"
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
Agreed. Begrudgingly. If I can find forgiveness, 
I will stand by her side until my life is done."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Mauvier] 
I am disgusted at my own incompetence. I hold 
no value save as a combatant in this war."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Ike] 
If that's how you feel, then try to learn skills 
valuable outside of war. This is the time for it."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Mauvier] 
A strange feeling, fighting together with a 
former enemy."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Yesterday's enemy is today's friend. It happens 
a lot more than you'd think."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Merrin] 
Once peace is restored, I plan to go around the 
world, checking out every rare critter there is."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Ike] 
What'll you do with these rare...critters when 
you find them? Are you gonna eat 'em?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
Not on your life! Laying eyes upon them...that's 
my dream. Would you care to join me, Sir Ike?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Ike] 
So you're pursuing a dream, are ya? All right. 
I'd be up for that."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Merrin] 
I'd like to learn a new fighting move that looks 
cool. What would you recommend, Sir Ike?"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I prefer practical moves to cool moves. Though, 
come to think of it, Aether is pretty cool."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Merrin] 
I'm sure you and I will get on just fine, Sir Ike! 
We meat connoisseurs have to stick together."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Right. Well, I'm glad to be working with you 
too, Merrin."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Timerra] 
Say, Ike, what sorta stuff does a band of 
mercenaries get up to usually?"
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Ike] 
All kinds. Stopping bandits, saving villages... 
A queen once asked us to defeat some invaders."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
I love it! Sounds like you were a band of heroes, 
more like."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Ike] 
I don't know about that. We just couldn't stand 
to walk away when people were in trouble."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Something smells good."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Timerra] 
I'm grilling up some meat! Oh, uh, I hope you 
enjoy the smells...even if you can't eat it."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Because of your work guarding the ring, I was 
summoned safely. You have my sincere thanks."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Timerra] 
Forget the formalities. You spent all that time 
hanging out at the castle. You're like family!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lord Ike, what's up with folks always wanting 
to go to war? Me, I'm wishing hard for peace."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Everyone has their own reason. And the truth 
is, wishing for peace won't make it a reality."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Ike] 
Look at us. We're at war to restore peace, right? 
But don't worry. I'll be with you the whole way."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Those are some wise words, Lord Ike. I, for one, 
am ready to follow wherever you lead!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
So, churches in this world are pretty...over the 
top, huh?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, well, I just remodeled this one to be super 
snazzy. Too bad they can't all be like this."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lord Ike! Did you come to pray? Why don't 
you join me? The more the merrier."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Ike] 
I just came to listen, but, uh...I guess a prayer 
every once in a while can't hurt."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Panette] 
Alas, I have committed yet another blunder! I 
must endeavor to refine my technique in battle."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Ike] 
I don't know what the problem is. It's not like 
Timerra said anything to you, right?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Panette] 
I am the princess's retainer! A poor performance 
by me reflects poorly on her. I won't have that!"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Ike] 
Ah, sorry for being such an oaf. She must be 
really important to you."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Panette] 
I hear you were in the service of a royal family. 
I imagine they were quite strict about etiquette."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Ike] 
My friends told me I misstepped sometimes, but 
I never noticed any problems."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Panette] 
Greetings and salutations, Ike. I say, you look 
quite splendid this very day."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Ike] 
You have a...unique way of talking. I wonder 
where you picked that up from?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Rosado] 
How is it so easy for you to just treat everyone 
the same? What's your secret?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Ike] 
I've seen how some raise themselves high. 
While others get swept aside."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Ike] 
It's nonsense─those who think they're better 
than others and want other races in their place."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Rosado] 
You're totally right. I wish everyone could see 
the world that way."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Rosado] 
Know what I admire about you, Ike? You're the 
same way with everyone. You never pretend."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Ike] 
Nice way to say I've got no manners. I was 
never any good at that sort of thing."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
I had my eye on you in that last battle, Rosado. 
You're a skilled fighter."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Rosado] 
You watched me all that time, and your only 
comment is about my fighting?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Saphir] 
You're always looking to be the strongest. 
What's behind that, I wonder?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Ike] 
Nothing but the obvious. I want to see how far 
I can go."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Ike] 
You're the same way, aren't you, Saphir?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
Hehe, suppose I am. I like you, Ike. I feel like we 
understand each other."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Saphir] 
So your father's the one who taught you 
to handle a sword."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Ike] 
Best gift he ever gave me. A true master of his 
techniques would be near unstoppable."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You sizing me up or something?"
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Saphir] 
No need to put your guard up. I just thought 
we might be alike."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Seadall] 
Your desire to improve yourself is impressive. 
You are already strong, yet try to be stronger."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Ike] 
That's nice to hear, but I still have a long way to 
go before I reach my goal."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Ike] 
What I want is to be stronger than my father─ 
my late father. But I'm still not there."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Seadall] 
Ah, I understand. I very much hope, one day, to 
surpass my late master's dancing skills as well."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Seadall] 
I noticed you've been watching me dance. I'm a 
bit surprised. Have you taken a liking to it?"
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I guess I have. It's...beautiful. And I appreciate 
the years of discipline it takes to move like that."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Seadall] 
Ike, you should not go outside today. Your 
fortune...it doesn't look good."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Ike] 
So, you're a dancer and a fortune-teller? 
Those are some good skills to have."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Your skills are impressive, but you have no 
confidence to match. I'm confused."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
I apologize, Lord Ike. If you compare me to my 
stronger brother, it may become clear..."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Ike] 
I had a similar problem looking up to my father. 
You are strong, Alcryst. Try to remember that."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Thank you, Ike. I'm not sure why, but...you 
make me think that's actually...possible."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You really helped me in that last battle, Alcryst. 
Thank you."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
No need to thank me! It would be unforgivable 
for a waste like me to not fully protect you."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Do you have a minute to talk, Alcryst?"
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Wow. You remembered my name... Thank you 
for giving me such a high compliment, Lord Ike!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Amber] 
I heard a legend about a golden-fleeced alpaca. 
Let's go find it, Ike!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Ike] 
OK, but...where? Do you have any clues we 
could start with?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Amber] 
Alpacas live on mountains. If we search every 
mountain, top to bottom, we'll find it for sure!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Ike] 
Oh. So it's going to be a...long trip."
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Say, Amber...how does alpaca meat taste? 
Is it any good?"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Amber] 
What? Alpacas aren't food! They're only for 
cuddling and being best friends!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Amber] 
I'm Amber, the alpaca-wrangling master! I'm a 
hero like you. We're gonna make a great team!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Ike] 
I'm no hero, but I do look forward to fighting 
alongside you, uh...alpaca master?"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
The way you're built, you must have been quite 
the fighter in your day."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
I have trained hard to stay in shape during my 
years of service to Queen Lumera."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Vander] 
And I'll be long retired before I begin lagging 
behind you youngsters."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Ike] 
I'm not a youngster... Oh. Wait. I understand. 
Still, if we get the chance, I'd like to spar."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Did I just see you smile?"
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Vander] 
You needn't be surprised. I have been known to 
smile from time to time."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
What can I do? I do not like sitting idle."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Vander] 
If there is a battle, I will let you know. Until such 
a time, you should relax."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
What's wrong, Veyle? You look like you're not 
feeling so good."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
I haven't been able to sleep. I'm just really 
worried I'll wake up in a strange place again."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Ike] 
Well that's not happening. If I catch you 
sleepwalking, I'll stop you, OK?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
That's...not exactly it. But thank you, Ike. 
I think I'll sleep better tonight."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Have you gotten used to living here yet, Veyle?"
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Veyle] 
Yes. It's such a nice place. And when I'm here, 
I don't feel like I'm all alone."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Veyle] 
Ike...do you think you could ever be my friend?"
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Ike] 
Why do you ask that? Aren't we allies already?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Y'know, Ike... I'm surprised you haven't just 
come out and asked me about my past."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Ike] 
You obviously don't want to talk about it. 
I figure you'll tell me when you're ready."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
What if I'm never ready?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Ike] 
That's fine. What matters to me is the person 
you are now."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
Now that I think of it, I used to work with an 
assassin who had quiet steps like yours."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Why are you talking about assassins all of a 
sudden?! I just have quiet feet, that's all!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Wow, and I thought you looked strong from 
far off. Up close, I'm even more impressed!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Ike] 
How are you so light on your feet? I didn't 
even hear you walk up."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Zelkov] 
You are from another *world,* are you not, Ike? 
What did you do for your *livelihood* there?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Ike] 
I ran a mercenary company. Our jobs took us 
all over the continent."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
How fascinating. Boredom must have been 
the *least* of your concerns."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Ike] 
Yeah, we had a lot of tough scrapes. Way too 
much danger to get bored."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Ike] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Another child *fled* from the sight of me today."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Ike] 
I've dealt with a few such reactions myself. 
How about you try being a bit more friendly?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Ike] 2 
[Ike] 
You keep busy, don't you?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Indeed. My various *pursuits* provide me with 
a sense of purpose."
