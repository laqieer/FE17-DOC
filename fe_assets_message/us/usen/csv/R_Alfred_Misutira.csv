♪I went with Alfred on a camping trip...♪"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
♪The food was great and the songs were hip!♪"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
♪There were lotsa stars in the sky that night... 
And that's the end of my song, all right!♪"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alfred] 
Haha, good one! Way to let everybody know 
just how you feel!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Timerra] 
Aw, thanks. Most people don't think much of 
my singing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alfred] 
What? Your singing is fantastic! It makes my 
heart swell up inside."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Timerra] 
Hahaha! That's how it makes me feel too!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Timerra] 
Thanks, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Timerra] 
Oop! Looks like the fire's petering out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alfred] 
Ooh, allow me. Let's see here..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Timerra] 
Good work! You've got it down pat."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Timerra] 
What do you even need me here for? 
You're a natural."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alfred] 
Well, I had a great teacher."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Timerra] 
Hehe! Keep buttering me up, why don'tcha."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alfred] 
Thanks again. I've learned so much from being 
around you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alfred] 
It's really helped me get a handle on where your 
people are coming from."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Timerra] 
Ah! You were trying to gain some firsthand 
experience of Solmic culture, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alfred] 
Yeah. I thought if I tried Solm stuff, I'd get to 
know Solm's people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Timerra] 
Uh-huh, uh-huh. So then, tell me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Timerra] 
Does this mean you're planning to invade?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alfred] 
Not at all!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alfred] 
I swear, I'm learning all this so I can help bring 
our countries together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Timerra] 
Yeah, I know. I'm just yanking your chain."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Timerra] 
Still, I don't think our work here is done."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alfred] 
What makes you say that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Timerra] 
Because now it's my turn to learn more about 
the kingdom of Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Timerra] 
For Solm and Firene to grow closer, they both 
need to understand each other, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alfred] 
True enough."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Timerra] 
Well then, for the sake of our countries, you'd 
better tell me all about this homeland of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Alfred] 
With pleasure, Princess Timerra! Now where 
to begin..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1

[Alfred] 
Hey, Princess Timerra. I heard you ride wolves. 
Is that really true?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Timerra] 
Yup!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Timerra] 
When I was little, I'd tear through the halls of 
Solm Palace on wolfback. Made a real mess."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alfred] 
Impressive! I can't think of anybody that out of 
control in my family."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Timerra] 
Really? Most of my family is wild in one way 
or another."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Timerra] 
Oh, that reminds me. How'd you like it if I gave 
you wolf-riding lessons?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alfred] 
I was so hoping you'd ask."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Timerra] 
Fantastic! I'd be happy to show you the ropes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Timerra] 
I'm sure you won't mind getting bitten or 
thrown off now and again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alfred] 
As in more than once?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Timerra] 
Oh yeah, way more. And when the wolf's really 
agitated like that, I won't be able to call her off."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Timerra] 
But you can stop her on your own, as long as 
you've got plenty of muscle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alfred] 
Well..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Timerra] 
Experienced riders can keep their wolves under 
control, but it's a different story for newcomers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Timerra] 
I don't mean to scare you though. Most people 
do make it through training with all their limbs."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alfred] 
I'm having second thoughts here."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alfred] 
Maybe it's better I hold off. Can't let myself get 
sidelined while there's a war on, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Timerra] 
Yep, yep. Sometimes the bravest thing is 
knowing when to call it quits."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alfred] 
Why don't you show me camping instead?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alfred] 
It'd be fun to learn how you face the elements 
out in Solm. Even if it's just a little."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Timerra] 
Oh, absolutely! That does sound fun!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Timerra] 
I'll teach you everything I know! How to set up 
camp, which animals to watch out for..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Timerra] 
Oh, oh! And most important of all─singing! 
Nothing beats a good camping song."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alfred] 
Great. As soon as I get myself a tent, we'll be 
in business!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1

[Timerra] 
Prince Alfred, wait up!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alfred] 
Hiya, Princess Timerra. Need something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Timerra] 
Hehe! Need's a strong word. I just figured you 
were headed off to eat a snack."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alfred] 
Nope. I was about to start my workout."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Timerra] 
What?! Then why did you have such a big grin 
on your face?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alfred] 
Because working out is my favorite part of 
the day!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Timerra] 
Huh. I guess that tracks. I had it all backwards."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Timerra] 
Too bad, though. I was about to ask if I could 
come eat with you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
Haha, sorry to burst your bubble."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Timerra] 
Then again, training with you sounds pretty fun. 
Maybe I'll tag along after all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alfred] 
Oh, you're gonna work out with me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Timerra] 
Sure, why not! If you insist."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Timerra] 
Then we can have a nice, yummy meal together. 
Your treat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alfred] 
Ahh, I see what you're doing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alfred] 
Fine by me. I'm not gonna pass up a chance to 
pick the brain of the future queen of Solm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Timerra] 
Nothing too heavy, all right? I don't wanna ruin 
the meal by talking shop."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alfred] 
Gotcha, Princess Timerra. We'll keep it breezy. 
Nothing heavy at this dinner but the cream."
