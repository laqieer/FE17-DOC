[Jade] 
My novel is complete, Amber. As I mentioned 
earlier, I'd like for you to be the first to read it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Amber] 
Oh, great..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Amber] 
You really know how to rub it in, y'know? Fine. 
Let's see how embarrassed I'm gonna be..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Amber] 
Hmm... Hmm!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Amber] 
Jade...what is this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jade] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Amber] 
Is this... Is this book still based on me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Jade] 
Of course. Everything in that book is based on 
something you've shared with me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Amber] 
But where's the alpaca-pond incident?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Amber] 
I can't find a single embarrassing page in here. 
This book makes me seem so...so cool!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Jade] 
You're not stuck in second place, Amber."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jade] 
You were the first one to try stopping that 
stray alpaca."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jade] 
You were the first one to go looking for that 
lost child's parents at the fighting tournament."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Jade] 
I may be the one who closes the book each 
time, but only after you've opened it for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Amber] 
Whoa."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jade] 
You're kind. You're strong. And both Prince 
Diamant and I trust in you as a worthy retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Amber] 
Aw, Jade! Thank you! Your kind words... 
This great book... I feel so much better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jade] 
I'm glad. After all, you need to have confidence 
if you're going to watch our backs in battle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Amber] 
Yeah... Yeah! That settles it. I'm gonna keep 
training until I match the ""me"" in your book."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Jade] 
Oh, I'm very excited to watch you try."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Amber] 
OK, no more coasting. It's time to train like I've 
never trained before!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Amber] 
I'm gonna─ Gah! A rock?! Waaaugh!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Jade] 
Hm! Amazing. Looks like your training is off 
to a ""rocky start."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Jade] 
I have no doubt you'll grow stronger, Amber... 
but I hope some things about you never change."

[Jade] 
Hey, Amber. I'm still a few chapters short. May 
I ask you some more questions?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Hang on, Jade. First, I have a request for you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Amber] 
Please, please don't write about how I 
completely failed to catch that alpaca!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Jade] 
Wha─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Amber] 
My hometown is known for its alpaca expertise. 
I can't throw that kind of shame on them!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Amber] 
I was so bogged down by emotions and pond 
water that I failed to ask before. So...pleeease?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Jade] 
This comes as a bit of a shock. I won't make 
you a promise that I can't keep, Amber."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Jade] 
You've inspired my funniest, most successful 
works. People are excited for the next one..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Amber] 
OK, then..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Amber] 
Let's spar. If I win, you can't write anything 
about the alpaca-puddle incident!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jade] 
Fine by me. You're on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Amber] 
This will be our first sparring match since the 
tourney to select Prince Diamant's retainers..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Amber] 
That was also the first time I lost to you. 
I've been stuck in second place ever since."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Amber] 
That loss was like a curse. No matter what I do, 
I can't seem to beat you at anything."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Jade] 
Well, you did enter the final round of that 
tournament at a disadvantage."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Jade] 
You didn't have any time to warm up. You were 
too busy trying to help that lost child."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Amber] 
That's no excuse! You ended up helping too. 
You even found the kid's parents first."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Jade] 
Hmm, I take your point."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Amber] 
You're the one who's always finding success, 
and I'm the one who's always tripping up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Amber] 
That runaway alpaca was the last straw. 
My second-place streak ends today!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Amber] 
Get ready, Jade. There's no way I'm losing to 
you again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Jade] 
Had enough?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Amber] 
Aw... I just can't do it. I really can't beat you, 
Jade. It's...it's hopeless..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Jade] 
You remember our terms? I won, so I'm free to 
put whatever I want in my next novel."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Amber] 
Yeah, I remember. You beat me fair and square, 
so...write about whatever you want."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Jade] 
That's just what I'm going to do. But I'll make 
sure you're the first to read it when I'm done."

[Jade] 
Amber, may I ask you a few personal questions? 
I need some new material for my next novel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Amber] 
Oh! You're gonna write a book about me? 
Oh man! I love that! Fire away."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Jade] 
I'll start with an easy one. What's your all-time 
favorite thing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Amber] 
Is that a serious question? Come on! Alpacas all 
the way! They're the best."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Amber] 
I used to herd alpacas all the time back home. 
I'm like an alpaca-wrangling master, y'know?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jade] 
""Alpaca-wrangling master."" Amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Amber] 
I'm serious! If there was an alpaca here right 
now, I'd give you a demonstration."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Amber] 
But we're miles away from the nearest alpaca 
farm, so..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Jade] 
Wait. What is that sound?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Amber] 
That's the sound of an alpaca at full gallop! Ah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jade] 
You're right! I can see it now, and it's coming 
this way!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Amber] 
OK, Jade! You wanted material, you're gonna 
get it. Watch the wrangling master in action."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Amber] 
Hey! Alpaca! Slow it down, buddy!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Amber] 
Whoa, there! I said settle down!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Amber] 
AUGH! Waaaaaah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jade] 
Amber!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Amber] 
Ugh... Getting knocked into a pond wasn't what 
I wanted to show you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Jade] 
I can't believe an alpaca came out of nowhere 
like that. I'm just glad we were able to catch it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Amber] 
You mean YOU caught it. All I managed to 
catch was a mouthful of scummy water."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Amber] 
I can't even compete with you at something 
I'm genuinely good at..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Amber] 
Ngh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Jade] 
Amber, don't despair. There is a silver lining."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Jade] 
The alpaca, the pond, your flailing... Thanks to 
you, my next book is sure to be hilarious."
