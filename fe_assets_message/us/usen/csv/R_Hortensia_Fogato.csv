[Hortensia] 
Wow."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Hortensia] 
I gotta admit, you're actually kind of amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
Oh, you're in love with me? Well, I'll have to 
let your young heart down gently, then..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Gross. No. Not what I meant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Fogado] 
Haha, sorry, sorry. It's involuntary. What were 
you saying?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Hortensia] 
You really listen to your people's problems. 
Princess Timerra is lucky to have you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Hortensia] 
I help my sister, too, but only with the stuff that 
happens inside the palace."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Hortensia] 
Going around town with you has shown me 
what the rest of the world is like."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Hortensia] 
It makes me wonder if I've actually been helping 
Ivy...or if I've been kidding myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Fogado] 
Oh, I know that feeling─the bucket feeling."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Buckets? What?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Fogado] 
My sister has a huge amount of responsibility... 
And I can only help out in the smallest ways."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Fogado] 
It's like I'm trying to move a sand dune for her... 
And all I've got is a bucket, you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Hortensia] 
Hmm... You're right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Hm-hm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Y'know, you're actually being pretty cool."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Fogado] 
I'm glad you noticed. Does that mean we're on 
for tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Hortensia] 
Hehe, separate issue."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Hortensia] 
But I'll help you patrol the town all you want."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Fogado] 
Eh, I'll take it. Come on, then!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Hortensia] 
Let's go, bucket brigade."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Fogado] 
Hey, Miss! Are you out here by yourself?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Hortensia] 
There's Prince Fogado...talking to some lady."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Hitting on her, too, by the look of it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Some prince. I'm gonna put a stop to this!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Hortensia] 
You were helping her carry stuff? That's it?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Fogado] 
Yeah, of course. Why did you get so angry?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Hortensia] 
I'm sorry. I didn't think you were actually 
helping people out here..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Fogado] 
I told you that I patrol around town. That's what 
I do on patrol─help people."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Hortensia] 
I guess I'm sorry for doubting you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Fogado] 
Nah, that's all right. I'm used to it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Hortensia] 
If that's the case, I suppose I'll join you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Fogado] 
Really? Great! What time will you join me for 
tea, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Join you in helping people, doofus."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Fogado] 
Haha! Oh, that's what you meant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Fogado] 
All right, then. I look forward to it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Fogado] 
Princess Hortensia! You're not busy, are you? 
Let's grab a cup of tea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Hortensia] 
Prince Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Hortensia] 
I know I'm irresistible, but I'm also a princess. 
You shouldn't be hitting on me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Fogado] 
I'm not up to anything, I promise. Was hoping 
to have a nice, chaste exchange of ideas."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Hortensia] 
Hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Act innocent if you want, but even in Elusia, 
we've heard what a flirt you are."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Fogado] 
People talk about me all the way in Elusia? 
I'm flattered."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Hortensia] 
You wouldn't be if you heard what they said."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Fogado] 
Why put stock in gossip? I want to have tea and 
learn of each other's countries. That's all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Hortensia] 
No thanks. Besides, my sister needs help today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Hey, you're a prince! Shouldn't you have a 
ton of work too?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Fogado] 
Solm is a queendom, so my sister is first in line 
to the throne, not me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Hortensia] 
So you just waste the day away, wandering 
around and flirting?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Fogado] 
Not flirting. Patrolling."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Oh, OK then. You definitely got me there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Hey! Why aren't you helping Princess Timerra?! 
Lighten her workload!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Fogado] 
Heh, ouch! That's harsh."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Fogado] 
Oh well. If you happen to change your mind and 
decide you'd like tea─just tea─I'm around."
