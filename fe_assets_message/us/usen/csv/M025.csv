what had been taken was unbearable. But then I met you."

We'd be together again."

You and I will...never be apart again."

I feel the same. Ever since we met, I've never felt

what memories returned..."
MID_OP2_#024,"Don't you remember, Mother?"
MID_OP2_#025,"[Lumera] 
Who cares what I said before? Now I want to 
be together as family."
MID_OP2_#026,"[Alear] 
I understand now."
MID_OP2_#027,"You don't think like my mother. You don't want 
what she wanted."
MID_OP2_#028,"[Lumera] 
You're speaking nonsense. I'm right here. 
I am your mother, !"
MID_OP2_#029,"[Alear] 
No. My mother─the one I wanted to see again, 
the one I loved─she's gone."
MID_OP2_#030,And she would want me to defeat you.
MID_OP2_#031,"She taught me to stand strong against my every 
opponent, whoever they might be."
MID_OP2_#032,"[Lumera] 
How sad your words make me. You're breaking 
my heart right now..."
MID_OP2_#033,"Who poisoned you against me? The Emblems? 
The stewards? That sister of yours?"
MID_OP2_#034,I suppose I have no choice but to kill them all.
MID_OP2_#035,"[Alear] 
Prepare for battle."
MID_OP2_#036,"[Veyle] 
I'm sorry. I meant to fight this battle for you."
MID_OP2_#037,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Veyle. But this isn't your burden 
to carry. It's mine."
MID_OP2_#038,"If I don't face this myself, I can't claim to be the 
Divine Dragon, an Emblem, or Mother's child."
MID_OP2_#039,"Let's do this. Together. Then we can face 
Sombron at last."
MID_OP2_#040,"[Veyle] 
Brother..."
MID_OP2_#040_F,"[Veyle] 
Sister..."
MID_OP2_#041,
MID_OP2_#042,You're crying.
MID_OP2_#043,"[Alear] 
Everyone, at the ready! We will free Mother's 
soul and break the final shard!"
