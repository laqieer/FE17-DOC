What's wrong, ? You won't win 
just by standing there."

Angry 

[Alear] 
Your stance has no openings. I don't see how 
I could hit you, no matter where I strike."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Lucina] 
Doubt will only dull your attacks. Trust in 
yourself, and come at me with everything!"
MID_BT1_#004,"[Alear] Strike 

[Alear] 
Understood! Here I come!"

[Alfred] 
Wow, the khans fought in the arena for the right 
to rule? It's almost like fate brought us here."
MID_BT2_#002,"[Lucina] b 
[Lucina] 
The khans didn't battle. They picked champions 
to fight on their behalf."
MID_BT2_#003,"[Alfred] Status 
[Alfred] 
Phew! If that is the case, I think it fortunate that 
this place is not the true arena."
MID_BT2_#004,"[Lucina]

Haha, indeed. Now, come at me!"

[Lucina] 
I lost... Your combat skills have grown 
admirably, ."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Lucina] 
Compared to when we first met, you've grown 
strong and become a formidable opponent."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alear] 
Thank you. It is in no small part because of your 
guidance, Lucina."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Lucina] 
Such kind words. If I helped you at all, then 
I couldn't be happier."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Lucina] 
There's a lesson there, you know. What one 
person can achieve on their own is limited."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
I agree. I couldn't have come this far by myself."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Alear] 
Everything I've accomplished has been thanks 
to those who have fought beside me."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Lucina] 
I'm relieved to hear that. I feel my friends close 
by, even now. Their spirits live on in me."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Alear] 
Their spirits live on..."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Lucina] 
The power of my bonds with them helped us to 
change a hopeless future."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Lucina] 
The same as you are now, with your own allies."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Alear] 
You're one of those allies, Lucina. Aren't you?"
MID_ED1_#013,"[Lucina] 
Of course! I'll fight with you until the very last."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Alear] 
Then we can't lose. No matter what the world 
sends our way."
MID_ED1_#015,"[Lucina] 
You're right! Our bonds are far stronger 
than destiny!"
MID_EV1_#001,"[Lucina] b 
[Lucina] StandBy 
[Lucina] 
Don't hold back. Strengthen our bond. Fight 
with everything you've got, !"

[Alear] 
What is this place, Lucina? I feel a magical 
power here."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Lucina] 
This appears very similar to Arena Ferox. 
Most curious."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
Ferox? That's a place from your world, right?"
MID_OP1_#004,"[Lucina] 
Yes. Ferox is a kingdom divided by east and 
west, with a militaristic khan overseeing each."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Lucina] 
Every so many years, a fighting tournament is 
held to determine which khan will rule them all."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Lucina] 
Arena Ferox is where I crossed swords with 
my father."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Alear] 
He taught you swordsmanship, yes? It must 
have been an interesting, if fierce, bout."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Lucina] 
Yes. It was a hard fight. He had no idea who 
I was and held nothing back."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Lucina] 
He'd trained me well, but that fight was when I 
first saw just how strong my father really was."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Lucina] 
That must be precisely why this familiar place 
was chosen as a trial ground."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Alear] 
Trial ground? What does that mean?"
MID_OP1_#012,"[Lucina] 
We each feel the extraordinary power here. 
Tell me what it feels like, deep down."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Alear] 
It's almost like I'm sensing your power...but also 
like you're far away."
MID_OP1_#014,"[Lucina] 
Well then, draw your weapon. Fight me. If you 
pass the trial, our bond will grow stronger."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Lucina] 
With a stronger bond, you will be able to draw 
upon more of my power as an Emblem."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Alear] 
I hope I can learn as much in this arena as 
you did."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Lucina] 
That's good to hear. However..."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Lucina] 
It's going to require more than hope for you to 
win this battle."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Alear] 
You're going to be surprised if you think I'm 
only bringing hope to this fight."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Lucina] 
That's the spirit, !"
