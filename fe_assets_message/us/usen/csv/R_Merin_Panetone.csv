[Merrin] 
The princess's singing advice proved a bit, 
uh...challenging."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Panette] 
Indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
""Merrin, take all that oomph and hold it right 
under your belly button!"""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Panette] 
Mystifying. What is ""oomph,"" and how does one 
""hold"" it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Merrin] 
The funny thing is, I kinda get it now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Merrin] 
When I focus on the spot right below my navel, 
my singing voice does get steadier."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Panette] 
Though her counsel was nigh inscrutable, you 
followed it well! Commendable."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Merrin] 
Haha! Thanks, Panette. And remind me, what 
was it the princess told you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Panette] 
She said, ""You're at a WA-WA-WA. I need you at 
a dee-dee-dee!"""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Panette] 
I was dizzy with confusion. Dizzy, I say."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Panette] 
But when I tried to put her advice into action, 
something unthinkable happened."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Panette] 
It worked!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Merrin] 
Perfect! Now no one will even think to call us 
the Racket of Solm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Panette] 
Certainly not. All across the queendom, we will 
put smiles on faces."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Merrin] 
Instead of holes in eardrums!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Panette] 
At this rate, we may soon be ready to put on 
a concert."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Merrin] 
A concert, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Panette] 
Our listeners will be so mesmerized that they'll 
call us...the Sirens of Solm!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Merrin] 
Ooo, that would be incredible! I want people to 
call me a siren."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Panette] 
Now I'm all aquiver! Let us resume practicing 
tout suite!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Merrin] 
I agree. We have to get ""Expect a Trifecta"" 
ready for showtime."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Panette] 
Yes. We'll combine our voices into an angelic 
harmony that does the boss proud!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Panette] 2 
[Merrin] 
Hey. What's the scuttlebutt?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Panette] 
The what?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Merrin] 
You know, our singing practice the other day. 
Were there any complaints?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Panette] 
Ah, no reason to fret. I have heard nary an 
ill word."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Merrin] 
Phew. I was worried about that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Merrin] 
Wait."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Merrin] 
No. This is all wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Panette] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Merrin] 
Singing quietly so nobody calls us names? 
Surely we can aim higher than that!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Merrin] 
There's no escaping it. We have to get better 
at singing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Panette] 
Yes. Quite right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Panette] 
To hide our voices in shame... We sully the good 
name Timerra!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Panette] 
If the boss learned of this, she would weep 
with embarrassment."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Merrin] 
No, no. I couldn't live with myself if I made the 
princess cry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Panette] 
Nor I!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Panette] 
The question is, how to improve? Hm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Merrin] 
Maybe we should ask the princess for advice."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Panette] 
You think so?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Merrin] 
But this time, we get serious feedback. None of 
that ""unique"" wolfdung."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Panette] 
A grand idea! By all means, let us press for the 
full, unvarnished truth."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Panette] 2 
[Merrin] 
All right. It's time for our daily singing practice."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Merrin] 
Today we'll run through the princess's latest 
composition, ""Expect a Trifecta."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Merrin] 
We need to have it performance-ready in time 
for our next rehearsal with her."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Panette] 
Performance-ready, you say..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Merrin] 
Uh, yes. Something wrong? You seem down."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Panette] 
In truth, I am. I overheard something that 
bothered me greatly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Merrin] 
Uh-oh. What was it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Panette] 
Someone called us the Racket of Solm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Merrin] 
Oh."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Merrin] 
The ""Racket"" is our singing voices, I take it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Panette] 
That was my understanding as well."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Merrin] 
Ouch."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Merrin] 
Well, growing up, people always told me I was 
a terrible singer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Merrin] 
But the princess praised my singing voice as 
unique, so... Guess I thought I improved."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Panette] 
It was the same for me, to the letter."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Merrin] 
Ugh. Suddenly it seems like we've got our work 
cut out for us."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Panette] 
Perchance we should sing more...quietly?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Merrin] 
That might be a good idea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Panette] 
Then let us begin posthaste. A one, a two, 
a one, two, three..."
