[Citrinne] 
Oh, Clanne! Fancy meeting you here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
Hi, Citrinne! It's been a while."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
I've been meaning to ask you about that one 
wildflower. Is it still in good health?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Clanne] 
Oh. I'm afraid not. It started to wither again, 
and I can't seem to help it this time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Citrinne] 
Oh no... That's awful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Clanne] 
No, it's OK. I think it was just time for the 
flower to go. Nature's doing its job."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Citrinne] 
Don't give up, Clanne. We'll come up with a 
way to fix it. Just let me think..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Citrinne] 
Perhaps I could import some nutrient-rich 
fertilizer. That may be enough to..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Clanne] 
Citrinne..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Right. Of course. This isn't something that can 
be fixed through a show of wealth."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Citrinne] 
But I must do something. All of your hard work 
is fading away. You must be heartbroken..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Clanne] 
Actually, I'm mostly just thankful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Citrinne] 
Why is that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Clanne] 
Caring for that flower together ended up making 
us better friends. So, yeah...I'm thankful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, Clanne... How sweet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Clanne] 
Here, I have something to give to you this time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Clanne] 
These are seeds from the wildflower. I picked 
them before it wilted again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Citrinne] 
So the flower can live on. Wonderful!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Citrinne] 
This is worth more than any number of jewels 
or gemstones. I love it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Citrinne] 
Would you be willing to help me plant these?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Clanne] 
Sure! We can plant them all over the Somniel. 
We'll fill this whole place with wildflowers."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Citrinne] 
Yes, let's. And...Clanne? I hope you'll accept 
a gift in kind."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Clanne] 
The brooch again? But I thought..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Citrinne] 
It's not a reward for hard work this time. I just 
want you to have it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Clanne] 
Heh heh, OK. If you put it that way, I accept. 
Thank you, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Citrinne] 
And thank you for accepting it, Clanne."

[Citrinne] 
Hello, Clanne. How is our wildflower friend 
doing today?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
It's made a full recovery! Looks pretty sturdy. 
I think I'll be able to remove the support soon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Citrinne] 
What fantastic news! It's all thanks to your hard 
work and diligence, you know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Clanne] 
It wasn't just me. You've been coming to visit 
too. I'm sure that helped it grow stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, I only checked on it from time to time. 
You put in the real effort."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Citrinne] 
That reminds me... I've been saving something 
for when this flower had fully healed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Here, Clanne. This is a reward for all your hard 
work reviving that wildflower. You earned it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Clanne] 
Oh my gosh. It's..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Citrinne] 
It's a flower brooch. Isn't it perfect?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Clanne] 
This looks...expensive. Uh, I don't think I can 
accept this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, but it didn't cost that much. Besides, you 
should be compensated for your efforts."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Clanne] 
I'm sorry, Citrinne. I didn't help this little 
wildflower just to get some kind of reward."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Clanne] 
I hope it's not rude of me to turn it down. 
It's just... Oh, I'm really sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Citrinne] 
It's all right, Clanne. I promise I'm not upset."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Citrinne] 
I apologize for how I approached this situation. 
It seems I've crossed the line again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Clanne] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Citrinne] 
All of my own goodwill gestures usually end up 
revealing how privileged my life has been."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Citrinne] 
I know it's something I need to address, and 
I do try, but...I just can't seem to get it right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Clanne] 
Citrinne? Are you OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Citrinne] 
Please, don't worry about me. I should go."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Citrinne] 
I am very happy to see the wildflower looking 
so healthy. Job well done, Clanne."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Clanne] 
Aw, Citrinne..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Citrinne] 2 
[Clanne] 
That's it. Come on, little buddy. You can do it!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Clanne? What are you up to out here?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Clanne] 
Ahh!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Oh! I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to startle 
you like that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Citrinne] 
You had such a serious look. I was just curious."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Clanne] 
It's, uh, nothing. I-I wasn't doing anything."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Oh my. Was it something...private?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Citrinne] 
Don't fret. I didn't see a thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Clanne] 
Huh?! No! It's nothing like that!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Clanne] 
I was just...talking to a wildflower."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Why were you doing that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Clanne] 
I found this withered flower out here and felt 
bad for it, so...I propped it back up, watered it..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Clanne] 
And, little by little, it started getting better."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Citrinne] 
Haha, oh! Well, my goodness."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Clanne] 
I know, I know. It's weird to get this attached to 
a single wildflower."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Not at all. I think you've done a wonderful 
thing here, Clanne."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Clanne] 
Oh? You really think so? Well, uh...thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Citrinne] 
Would it be all right with you if I watched over 
this flower as well?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Clanne] 
Yeah! Of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Citrinne] 
Haha, this flower must be happy to have found 
such a hard-working caretaker."
