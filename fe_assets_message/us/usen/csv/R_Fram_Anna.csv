[Anna] 
Come one, come all! Step right up and see!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Anna] 
I've got great deals on rare goods! It's a one- 
time offer─buy now or regret it later!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Framme] 1 
[Framme] 
How's business, Lady Anna?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Anna] 
Business is booming! My inventory's flying off 
the shelves faster than I can restock."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Framme] 
Well, here. Something for the hardest-working 
merchant I know."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Anna] 
Are these tarts?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Framme] 
Yep! Beet tarts, in fact. I made them myself, 
so I know they're good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Anna] 
Can I try one?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Framme] 
Sure!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Anna] 
Nice! Down the hatch!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Anna] 
Mmm, yum! These really are tasty!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Framme] 
Hehe, I'm glad you like them. I learned the 
recipe from my mom."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Anna] 
Your mom..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Framme] 
Oh no! Uh, I mean─ I, um..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Framme] 
I'm so sorry, Lady Anna! I wasn't trying to make 
you feel sad!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Anna] 
Oh, I've got the perfect sales angle for 
those pies!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Framme] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Anna] 
We'll call them ""Mom's Sweet Beets."" They'll be 
a hit with kids and grown-ups alike!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Anna] 
Ooo, you gotta teach me how to make 'em!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Framme] 
Haha! Whew, I thought I'd said the wrong 
thing again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Anna] 
Don't worry about it. I told you before that 
smiles make sales, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Anna] 
I'm gonna ride this smile to a boatload of cash 
to search for my family!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Framme] 
Oh, good plan! I'll pitch in, and teach you that 
recipe so you can make lots of money!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Anna] 
Perfect! Ooo, thank you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Anna] 
Once I get these tarts on the market, we'll be 
swimming in cash. Cha-ching!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Framme] 1

[Framme] 
Thanks a bunch, Lady Anna!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Anna] 
Thanks for what?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Framme] 
I sent my parents the gift I bought from you, 
and they wrote back with a thank-you letter!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Anna] 
Oh, yeah! You did pick a great gift, it's true."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Framme] 
Yep! They loved it, just like you guaranteed 
they would."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Anna] 
It's my business to satisfy my customers. I hope 
that means you'll shop with me again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Framme] 
Sure will! Oh, and look at this part of the letter 
from my mom."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Anna] 
Let's see here..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Anna] 
""The statuette was lovely. Be sure to thank your 
friend Lady Anna for us."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Anna] 
""We'd love to host her, too, if you ever have a 
chance to visit home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Anna] 
""Tell her I'll treat her to one of my famous 
home-cooked meals if she comes along."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Framme] 
My mom's not kidding about her cooking being 
famous. So you should definitely come visit!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Anna] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Framme] 
Did I say something wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Anna] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Anna] 
I wanna send my family a letter too!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Framme] 
Aww, Lady Anna..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Framme] 
I forgot that you're on your own right now, 
away from your family..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Framme] 
I'm sorry I made you think about sad stuff. 
But it's OK! You've got us!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Anna] 
Thanks, Framme... I really appreciate that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Anna] 
Tell your mom thanks for me too. And tell her 
I'd be happy to come over sometime."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Framme] 
Will do!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Anna] 
OK, enough moping around!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Anna] 
Nobody buys from a depressed merchant. 
Gotta smile to sell!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Anna] 2 
[Framme] 
I wanna get my parents something, but what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Anna] 
Hey, Framme!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Framme] 
Oh! Hey, Anna. Whatcha doing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Anna] 
Oh, ""Anna"" is so formal. Call me ""Lady Anna""!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Framme] 
Oh, right. Sorry. I meant, ""Hey, Lady Anna!"""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Anna] 
Yep, there you go. So, what are you in the 
market for today?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Framme] 
I'm looking for an anniversary present for 
my folks."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Framme] 
Oh─you're a merchant! Do you have anything 
like that for sale?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Anna] 
Framme, Framme, Framme. Of course I do."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Anna] 
Feast your eyes! You won't find gifts cheaper 
or better than these anywhere."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Framme] 
Ooh! These knick-knacks are so cute! I bet this 
statuette would look good in their house."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Anna] 
Tell you what. Since we're friends, I'll throw in 
an engraving of their names for free."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Framme] 
Hmm, that's tempting. You're pretty good at 
this, Lady Anna!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Anna] 
I got separated from my family. Being on my 
own has really put my sales skills to the test."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Anna] 
But look, everything I stock is rare and valuable. 
Your parents will love their gift, guaranteed."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Framme] 
In that case, I think I'll get this statuette. Some 
engraving would make it seem extra-special."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Anna] 
Thanks for the business! I'll gift wrap it for you, 
too, if you wait right there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Framme] 
You may be young, but you've really got this 
merchant thing down."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Framme] 
One thing's for sure─I'm not gonna make the 
mistake of calling you plain ol' Anna again!"
