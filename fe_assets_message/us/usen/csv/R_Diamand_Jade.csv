[Diamant] 
Jade! I finished my first draft. Care to give it 
a read?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Diamant] 
It's titled, ""The EXTRA Adventures of Amber, 
the Deliberate Dummy."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Jade] 
You... You actually wrote it..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jade] 
Yes. Of course, Prince Diamant. I would...love 
to read it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jade] 
Hm, this is pretty funny. However..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Diamant] 
Be honest. Don't hold back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Jade] 
These pages might benefit from a few more 
gags. If you revised this scene just a bit..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Diamant] 
Hmm. What would you change?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Jade] 
If I were writing it...I'd have all of the alpaca's 
wool explode off of its body."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Diamant] 
Haha."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jade] 
And then, just as Amber composes himself, its 
wool grows back in a flash─silky and smooth."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jade] 
Amber tries to mount his alpaca, but its wool is 
so smooth that he slips─no, shoots right off."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Jade] 
As Amber soars through the air and over the 
horizon...his alpaca wistfully spits at the ground."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Diamant] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Diamant] 
That's perfect! Your version flows much better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jade] 
Thank you. But the larger framework of your 
story is quite good, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jade] 
I'd love to give you further notes once you 
have your second draft ready."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Diamant] 
No, I'm done."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Jade] 
Huh?! Why did you crumple your draft?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Diamant] 
It served its purpose. Sounds like your new 
book is well on its way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Jade] 
My new book?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Diamant] 
Sure. Your silky-smooth wool idea was superb. 
I trust you'll pick things up from there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Jade] 
Wait. Did you..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Jade] 
Were you just trying to lift me out of my slump? 
By kicking off a first draft for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Diamant] 
Are you suggesting that I wrote a weak draft 
on purpose? I'm not that clever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Diamant] 
I gave it my best effort. My jokes just couldn't 
stand against those of a true artist."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Jade] 
Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Jade] 
You may deny that was your plan, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Jade] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Diamant] 
All right. Almost time to get back to work."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Diamant] 
Don't worry about tonight's watch, Jade. I can 
handle it myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Jade] 
But..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Diamant] 
You've been fighting extra hard lately. I'm sure 
that contributed to your slump. Get some rest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Diamant] 
And whenever that book is ready, let me know. 
Nothing relaxes me like laughing at your writing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Jade] 
Understood. Thank you very much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038,"[Jade] 
As long as I'm your retainer, Prince Diamant..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#039,"[Jade] 
I vow to protect every bone in your body. 
Especially the funny one."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Jade] 2 
[Diamant] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Diamant] 
Haha, I can't─ I can't stop... Haha! 
Aah, my sides!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Jade] 
Prince Diamant, are you OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Diamant] 
Am I OK? You almost killed me! Your writing is 
hazardous to my health, Jade."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jade] 
It's an unexpected honor to have my storytelling 
threaten a crown prince's life."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Jade] 
Which part are you on?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Diamant] 
Chapter 19 of ""The Adventures of Amber, the 
Deliberate Dummy."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Jade] 
Ah. So you're at the part where Amber just won 
the fighting tournament?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Diamant] 
Yes! And he returned to his hometown to 
celebrate his victory, but no one believed him!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Diamant] 
And then the scene where he rides his mighty 
alpaca through the open fields to dry his tears..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jade] 
As soon as he dismounts, his eyes finally dry... 
the alpaca spits right in his face. Poor Amber."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Diamant] 
This isn't just a funny novel, Jade. This book 
is art."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Diamant] 
Tell me, when will the next one be ready?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jade] 
Well...I wanted to talk to you about that. I might 
take a break from writing. Just for a while."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Diamant] 
Oh. Really?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Diamant] 
I think I understand. Our battles are growing 
more intense. Not much we can do about that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jade] 
Yes. That's certainly a factor, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Jade] 
Lately, no matter what I write...it all feels flat 
to me. I'm bored by my own ideas."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Diamant] 
Ah. So you're in a bit of a slump?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Jade] 
Yes. I need to rest my pen for a while. I'm sorry 
if this news disappoints you, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Diamant] 
No need to apologize. I'm an eager, yet patient, 
reader. Take as long as you need."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Jade] 
Thank you very much. If I start writing again, 
I'll let you know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Diamant] 
If anything, I'm glad to hear you'll be giving 
yourself a break. In the meantime..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Diamant] 
Why don't I write the next book?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Jade] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Diamant] 
Don't worry. I won't step on your work. It'll be 
more like a...side story. I'd enjoy the challenge."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Jade] 
Uh... You're serious about this?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Diamant] 
I'm always serious. I'll let you know when it's 
done. You just relax until then."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029,"[Jade] 
Yes. Understood..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Jade] 2 

[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Diamant] 
Anything to report?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Jade] 
Oh. Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Jade] 
No news here. It's a quiet night."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Diamant] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jade] 
Standing guard like this reminds me of the 
other day..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Diamant] 
Which day?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jade] 
The day of that snowstorm. I was guarding the 
Elusia border through most of it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Diamant] 
Right. That storm was awful."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Jade] 
It was snowing so heavily... I worried that I 
wouldn't be able to find you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Diamant] 
So did I."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Jade] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Diamant] 
I feared I might lose a trusted retainer to the 
cold. I almost worried myself sick."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Diamant] 
When I finally arrived and saw you were still 
standing strong, I breathed such a sigh of relief."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Jade] 
Oh. Well. Let's not get carried away...but thank 
you for your concern, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Diamant] 
Dawn should break any minute. I'll relieve you 
a bit early. Go get some sleep, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Jade] 
Understood."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Diamant] 
Good work tonight. Oh, and I'm excited to read 
your new chapters. Will they be ready soon?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Jade] 
Yes. Without delay."
