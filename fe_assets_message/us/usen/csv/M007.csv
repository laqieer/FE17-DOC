Hmm... There's a lot of damage to the bridge. 
It may take time to find a safe path forward."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
We didn't recover the Emblem Ring."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alfred] 
We didn't lose any either. And most importantly, 
you're not hurt."
MID_ED1_#007,Let's call that good enough.
MID_ED1_#008,"[Alear] 
You're right."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Vander] 1 

[Vander] 
It is plain now that Queen Lumera's stolen 
rings lie in Elusia's hands."
MID_ED1_#010,"In which case we can deduce that they 
possess five."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Alear] 
Five?"
MID_ED1_#012,"[Vander] 
Yes, counting the rings taken from 
Lythos Castle."
MID_ED1_#013,"The Rings of the Sage Lord, the Azure Twins, 
the Instructor, and of course, the Princess Exalt."
MID_ED1_#014,"Princess Hortensia was wielding the latter, 
as you'll recall."
MID_ED1_#015,"Besides those four, there was one entrusted 
to them by your forebears."
MID_ED1_#016,"[Alear] 
Which one?"
MID_ED1_#017,"[Alcryst] 
If I may, I believe it's the Ring of the Lady of 
the Plains."
MID_ED1_#018,"The king favors it, or so I've heard. He keeps it 
in his personal chambers."
MID_ED1_#019,"[Alfred] 
His chambers? That's odd. Firene's ring has a 
hall in the castle all to itself."
MID_ED1_#020,Where does your kingdom keep its ring?
MID_ED1_#021,"[Alcryst] 
Like Firene, we store ours in a special gallery in 
the castle."
MID_ED1_#022,"Speaking of which...how soon might we be able 
to depart?"
MID_ED1_#023,I really am worried about the situation there.

be strong."

Emblems were just a ""you"" thing? Not by a long shot."
MID_EV3_#004,"Yeah, it's a pretty cool trick, huh? I'm so glad I'm able to use 
it. And it's all thanks to Lord Sombron powering up this ring."
MID_EV3_#005,"It's called the Ring of the Princess Exalt. 
Cute, am I right?"

formally welcome you to the kingdom."

encountered were bizarre creatures. Or bandits."

little detour."

standing would have been seriously hurt."

dodge one arrow, you're not worthy to enter."

What did you say?"

She didn't mean that! Apologies... My country 
places too much value on strength."

Oh. Well... Thank you."

I'm so sorry for all this...so sorry. And I'm sorry

You can stop apologizing. I'm grateful that a 
prince is here to receive us personally."

Yes. Honored, in fact."

as divine, I see."

dazzling? I find it so hard to shine as it is..."

something Queen Ève said in her letter."
MID_OP2_#004,Is it true that Elusia has released Sombron?
MID_OP2_#005,"[Alear] 
It's true. An Elusian we fought told us as much."

I see."
MID_OP2_#007,"We'd heard rumors to that effect, but I didn't 
dare believe them."

rings to defeat the Fell Dragon, right?"

Ring of the Young Lion."

The Ring of the Young Lion..."

It has a red stone and a certain...gallant aura."

hearing a voice from the ring."

his brother."

Oh, yes. He's strong, wise, humble... The king 
adores him, as do our people."

I'm afraid I was made from the tatters..."

Not just soldiers, but regular people?"
