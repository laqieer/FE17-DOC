[Yunaka] 
Hey, Goldmary. I'm sorry for ruining all your 
fun the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Even just the thought of housework makes 
me fall apart so fast."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Don't worry yourself about that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Goldmary] 
As it happens, I've been thinking it over since 
then. And I may have an idea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Goldmary] 
I heard that you're gifted at impersonation. 
Is that true?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Yunaka] 
Sure. I mean, I'm decent at it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Goldmary] 
Would you like to try impersonating me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Yunaka] 
What? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Goldmary] 
Humor me. Show me what I was like washing 
clothes the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Yunaka] 
OK, if you insist. I think that went a little 
something like..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Yunaka] 
""♪Hmm-hmm...♪ It's a wonderful day 
for laundry."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Yunaka] 
""Wash, rinse, dry, starch, fold... Every step with 
precision and grace."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Goldmary] 
Wonderful. Keep that up, and follow me. We'll 
do laundry as two Goldmarys."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Yunaka] 
Sounds weird. Let's give it a go!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Goldmary] 
So, how did you feel? Any of the old dread?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Yunaka] 
Amazingly, no. Not even a little!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Yunaka] 
I was so focused on being you that I totally 
forgot about my past!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Goldmary] 
Perfect. Exactly as planned."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Goldmary] 
From now on, whenever you need to do chores, 
you can just pretend to be me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Goldmary] 
Once you form the habit, I think you'll find 
chores far less worrisome."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Goldmary] 
There's no easy cure for a wound like yours, 
but take it one small step at a time. You'll heal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Yunaka] 
So that's what you had in mind."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Yunaka] 
Great idea, Goldmary! You're a genius."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Yunaka] 
I said I wanted to be a new person, and now 
I have someone to be─you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Goldmary] 
I suppose there are worse goals to have. 
Consider me honored."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if my perfection is too much for you. 
But it's good to aim high, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Yunaka] 
Ooh, that's good. You're good. I need to start 
taking notes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Yunaka] 
""I'm sorry if my perfection is too much for you."" 
To be said coyly in response to praise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Goldmary] 
You're a little too quick a study! You don't have 
to imitate everything I say..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Yunaka] 
Hehe! Only kidding. But now I've got your 
flustered face in my back pocket too!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Yunaka] 
Thanks for taking me under your wing. I know 
I can be a handful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Goldmary] 
My pleasure. If you want me to be your teacher, 
I will happily accept you as a student."

♪Hmm-hmm...♪ Love to make the 
dishes sparkle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
Each polished plate rewards me with a view 
of my own scintillating smile..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Yunaka] 2 
[Yunaka] 
There you are, Goldmary. Look, I...wanted to 
apologize to you about the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Goldmary] 
Apologize? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Yunaka] 
You made doing laundry look like lots of fun. 
I actually did wanna join you. I just...couldn't."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Goldmary] 
I don't understand. What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Yunaka] 
I can explain, but it's...kinda personal."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Goldmary] 
It's all right. Don't be shy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Yunaka] 
OK, well... I normally hate to bring this up, 
but I had a horrible childhood."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Yunaka] 
My parents were too poor to raise me, so I was 
abandoned. I ended up living with a...stranger."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Even from a really young age, he had me doing 
all the housework."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Yunaka] 
So...something about doing chores takes me 
right back to that place. It fills me with dread."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Goldmary] 
I had no idea."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Yunaka] 
These days, I always do stuff like laundry 
and dishes alone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Yunaka] 
That way I'm not bothering anybody if I go to 
pieces over it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Goldmary] 
I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Yunaka] 
But I'm not here to make excuses. I'm 
determined to put my past behind me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Yunaka] 
I wanna be a totally new person. 
So in the spirit of a fresh start..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Yunaka] 
Let's do some chores!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Goldmary] 
I admire your courage, Yunaka. In that case, 
please join me in washing the dishes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Yunaka] 
You got it, Goldmary!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1

♪Hmm-hmm...♪ It's a wonderful day

MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Goldmary] 
Wash, rinse, dry, starch, fold... Every step with 
precision and grace."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Yunaka] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Look at you, enjoying your chores! Is that 
even allowed?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Goldmary] 
I should hope so. Ah, I love laundry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Goldmary] 
Care to join me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Yunaka] 
Me? Eh... I'll pass."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Goldmary] 
Are you sure?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Goldmary] 
You might discover that washing clothes on a 
sunny day is refreshing and restorative."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Goldmary] 
Keeping neat and clean won't exactly lose you 
any friends either."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah, I don't care about that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Goldmary] 
Or maybe you've got something hidden among 
your unmentionables and don't want me to see?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Yunaka] 
What?! Gross, no!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Goldmary] 
I suppose I'll take your word for it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Yunaka] 
Look, it's just...better if I decline. Sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Goldmary] 
Why is that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Yunaka] 
It just is. I'd rather not get into why."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Yunaka] 
Actually, I'd better go. See you around."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Yunaka] 
[Goldmary] 
I wonder what that was about."
