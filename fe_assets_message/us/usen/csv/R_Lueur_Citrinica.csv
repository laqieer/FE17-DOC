[Citrinne] 
Hello once again, Divine One. I've come to 
give you...this gift."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
Oh, Citrinne! What a gorgeous bouquet!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
I thought of you as I picked each flower. I hope 
these will suffice..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
You hand-picked all of these flowers for me? 
That's a wonderful gesture."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Citrinne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
Citrinne? Are you OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Citrinne] 
I once had a very close friend who loved gifts... 
and would make a game of begging for things."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Citrinne] 
Each gift made her so happy. Over time, it 
became a natural part of our rapport."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Citrinne] 
Then, one day, I surprised her with a bouquet 
just like this. She begged for a dress instead..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Citrinne] 
When I asked if she didn't like the flowers, she 
grew angry. She said I was being...cheap."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
That's awful. Is that why you offered to give me 
such expensive gifts?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Citrinne] 
Yes. That's why."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
If someone won't be your friend unless you buy 
things for them, that isn't a real friendship."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alear] 
I think this bouquet is a wonderful gift, Citrinne. 
It makes me very, very happy. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Citrinne] 
I'm so glad to hear it. I finally found the right 
way to express my gratitude."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Citrinne] 
That makes me very, very happy as well. 
Thank you, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Citrinne] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Hello again, Divine One. I gave your words on 
gifts some thought."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Citrinne] 
You said you would prefer something that 
money could not buy..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Citrinne] 
I apologize for the delay. It feels as if I've kept 
you waiting for days, weeks, months!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
It really hasn't been that long..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Citrinne] 
To me, it felt like an eternity."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
Do you have an idea?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Indeed I have. I think this token of my gratitude 
will be much more to your liking. For you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
Oh. It's, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Citrinne] 
It's a pebble!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
Yes. This certainly is a pebble."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Citrinne] 
I found it sitting on the side of the road and 
paid nothing to acquire it. What a thrill!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Citrinne] 
No cost. No worth. I quite literally stumbled 
upon the perfect gift for you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Citrinne] 
Is something the matter, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
I guess I didn't explain myself well enough."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
Imagine that you found this pebble a long time 
ago and kept it. Maybe you grew attached to it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
If you were to give me that pebble─one you 
cherished─I would consider it a wonderful gift."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Citrinne] 
One that I...cherished?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
You know, sentimental value? Worth that comes 
from the heart rather than the wallet?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Citrinne] 
Worth that comes from the heart..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Citrinne] 
I think I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Citrinne] 
Next time, I'll offer you something that will truly 
delight you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Citrinne] 
Rest easy, Divine One! I shall return!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Citrinne] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Excuse me, Divine One. I wanted to thank you 
for aiding me in battle the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Citrinne] 
If it's not inappropriate, I would like to find a 
gift for you to fully express my gratitude."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
A gift? That isn't necessary, Citrinne. I only did 
what anyone would have done."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Haha! Oh, Divine One. You're too modest!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Citrinne] 
Aha! A gift idea has just come to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Citrinne] 
An acquaintance of the Brodian royal family is 
looking to sell their private island─at cost!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
What would you say to your own private island 
getaway? My treat, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
An entire island?! That's really not─"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Citrinne] 
Not enough. I agree. Shall I add some of my 
antique jewelry? It's just a few generations old..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
No! Citrinne, I don't need expensive gifts."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Really? Then...what sort of gift would you be 
more inclined to accept?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
Well, if I can't talk you out of it..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
To be honest, I would prefer the kind of gift 
that money can't buy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Citrinne] 
Something that money...cannot buy?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alear] 
No private islands. No jewelry. I value gifts that 
aren't defined by how much they cost."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
That's the best kind of gift a person can receive. 
Do you understand?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Citrinne] 
I see. Let me just...think on this for a while. 
Farewell for now, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Citrinne] 2 

[Alear] 
Here, Citrinne. Have a look at this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Is that a dried flower? It looks familiar..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
It's from the bouquet you gave me. I carefully 
dried each flower for use as a decoration."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Oh! Yes, of course! I'm delighted to see how 
you've taken such good care of them."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
I think of your kindness each time I look at 
them, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Citrinne] 
What a lovely thought. Thank you for sharing 
this with me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
I didn't call you over just to show you 
the flower."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
This time, I have a gift for you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Citrinne] 
You do? For me? What might that be?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
This. The Pact Ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Citrinne] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Citrinne] 
But this is a historic piece of jewelry. I suspect 
it's worth more than all of my riches combined!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Citrinne] 
Why would you give this to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
Don't think of how much it's worth. I'm giving 
this to you as a token of our friendship."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
I want you to be my closest confidant, Citrinne. 
Are you willing to walk and fight by my side?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Oh my..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Citrinne] 
Of course I am, Divine One. I will happily accept 
this gift."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
I'm so glad to hear it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Citrinne] 
Heh, you know, I love to give gifts, but I rarely 
receive them myself..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Citrinne] 
You were right about sentimental value. A gift 
from the heart is a wonderful gift indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
Couldn't agree more."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Citrinne] 
Thank you, Divine Dragon ... 
I must be the luckiest person in the world."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Citrinne] 
When this war is over, we must attend a formal 
ball together. I know that's a long way off..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Why wait? We could just dance right here 
and now."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
Think of it as a formal-ish ball. Just for us."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Citrinne] 
I'd like that very much."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Citrinne] 
What a gift exchange this is─you and I both 
offering to support one another. It's priceless."
