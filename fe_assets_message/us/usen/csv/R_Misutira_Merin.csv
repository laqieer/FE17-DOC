[Merrin] 
I'll never forget the look on your face when you 
knighted me. So serious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
Well, yeah! I was dead set on it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
After all our time on the road together, I could 
see what a good person you were."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
I'd have been crazy not to pin you down as 
soon as I could."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Merrin] 
Hahaha, my princess. You flatter me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Merrin] 
Though I do wish you had revealed your 
identity beforehand..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Timerra] 
This again! It just slipped my mind, that's all. 
I told you right after, didn't I?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Timerra] 
We even went to your village together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Merrin] 
Yes, that's true."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Merrin] 
The way you bowed your head before my 
mother, the village matriarch..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Merrin] 
And then boldly asked if she'd give the 
knighting her blessing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Merrin] 
I've never seen her so shocked. But she agreed 
on the condition that I return to lead one day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Timerra] 
Your mother's a good woman. She could tell 
our hearts were set on it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Merrin] 
Haha."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Merrin] 
From then on, I was yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Merrin] 
That was the day the clouds opened and my life 
filled with sunlight."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Timerra] 
And you called me a flatterer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Merrin] 
So help me, your radiant luster will never dim."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Merrin] 
That, my princess, is why I devote myself 
wholly to your service."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Timerra] 
Thank you, Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Timerra] 
I hope you'll stay at my side, now and forever. 
My knight in shining armor. My friend."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1

[Timerra] 
Y'know, sitting with you by a toasty fire...it feels 
just like the good old days."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Merrin] 
Yes. We shared many a night like this after that 
first encounter─our scuffle with the bandits."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Merrin] 
Back when we were just a couple of travelers 
roving the queendom together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Merrin] 
At the time, of course, I had no idea my princess 
was actually a princess."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Timerra] 
You never asked. Honestly, I assumed you'd 
piece it together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Merrin] 
Listen, Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Merrin] 
Most royals don't sneak out of their castles to 
rain justice on unsuspecting bandits."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Timerra] 
Yeah, well. I'm not most royals."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Merrin] 
Haha, no argument there."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Merrin] 
But really. Do you remember how shocked I was 
to learn that you were the princess of Solm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Merrin] 
I had just gotten through telling you...basically 
my whole life story."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Merrin] 
How I had always dreamed of becoming a 
knight, but my lineage made it impossible."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Merrin] 
I told you that was the reason I ran away 
from home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Merrin] 
And then, you..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Timerra] 
I asked if you really, truly wanted to be a knight."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Merrin] 
And I said, ""Yes. With my whole heart, yes."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Merrin] 
You placed your sword on my shoulders, one 
after the other, and said..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Timerra] 
""I hereby deem thee a knight of the queendom."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Merrin] 
And I laughed! I thought it was all in fun."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Merrin] 
But you weren't laughing, my princess. You 
were looking at me like you meant it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Timerra] 
Hey, Merrin! You look like you're lost 
in thought."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Merrin] 
Ah. You could say that, Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Timerra] 
Well? What's on your mind?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Merrin] 
I was thinking about why I left my village."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Timerra] 
Ah, yeah. You didn't want to become the next 
village matriarch."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Merrin] 
Yes, that's right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Merrin] 
It was decided I had to take my mother's place, 
but I had always dreamed of being a knight."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Merrin] 
The whole thing was...unreasonable. So I left."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Timerra] 
You were a free spirit, even back then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Merrin] 
I wouldn't call myself a free spirit. Not really."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Merrin] 
But after traveling on my own for a while, 
roaming with nowhere to go..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Merrin] 
I met a fearless woman riding on a wolf. Now 
she was a free spirit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Timerra] 
Hehe! Who, me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Merrin] 
""Free spirit"" may not even cover it. You took on 
an entire gang of bandits by yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Timerra] 
And out of nowhere, you charged in to help. 
I'll never forget that day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Merrin] 
Neither will I."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Merrin] 
I didn't realize it then, but...that chance 
encounter would change my life."
