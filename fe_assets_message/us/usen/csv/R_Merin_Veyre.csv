[Veyle] 
Merrin, thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Merrin] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
Why are you thanking me all of a sudden?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
You told me I should take pride in the fact that 
I'm a dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Veyle] 
I'm not sure I can truly see it as a positive 
thing yet, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Veyle] 
But everything you said makes me think I might 
feel good about it...one day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Veyle] 
So, thank you, Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Merrin] 
Lady Veyle..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Merrin] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Veyle] 
Merrin? What's wrong?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Merrin] 
I-I'm all right... I'm just so happy you feel that 
way. I can't help crying."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Merrin] 
I will never forget this moment as long as I live!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Veyle] 
It's OK! You don't need to make a big deal out 
of it. Hehe, oh, you are unusual, aren't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Merrin] 
The both of us! What an unusual pair we make."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Veyle] 
Hehe, yes we do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Merrin] 
That's it. I've made up my mind!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Merrin] 
From now on, I'm going to help you figure out 
what's so great about being a dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Merrin] 
No one loves dragons more than I do, so that 
makes me the perfect person for the job."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Merrin] 
I'm going to find you so many reasons why 
being a dragon is cool!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Veyle] 
I'm so excited! And I'm so glad you're the one 
to help me with this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Merrin] 
And just like that, I've already found one reason."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Merrin] 
You are kind! And all those experiences you had 
during your long life as a dragon made you kind."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Veyle] 
I see. Hehe, but now you're making me blush."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Merrin] 
Oh, this is just the beginning. I'm going to find 
you a hundred─no, a thousand─reasons!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Merrin] 
You'd better prepare yourself, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Veyle] 
OK! I'm ready! You know, for the first time, 
I might actually be looking forward to life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Veyle] 
And it's all because of you, Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Veyle] 2 
[Merrin] 
You are so incredible, Lady Veyle. I'm filled with 
wonder every time I look at you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Merrin] 
Your hair, your skin, the way you carry yourself. 
Perfect! I mean, you're a dragon, so of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Veyle] 
I suppose."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Merrin] 
I do what I can with my own appearance, but 
I can't come anywhere near your level of cool."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Merrin] 
As a dragon, do you have to put effort into 
looking good? Or does it just happen naturally?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Veyle] 
I don't think I do anything special. I don't really 
know much about that stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Merrin] 
You look this cool without doing anything 
special?! Dragons are so incredible."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Veyle] 
Um, Merrin..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Veyle] 
I wonder, do you only find me...cool because 
I'm a dragon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Merrin] 
Oh! No, Lady Veyle, not at all! I think you're 
cool because of who you are. I really do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Merrin] 
But I have to ask, do you feel ashamed that 
you're a dragon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Veyle] 
Yes, of course I do. My whole life people have 
hated me because of it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Merrin] 
That's not your fault. That's their fault. They 
hated you without really knowing you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Veyle] 
But I must have some bad qualities for people 
to hate me that much."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Merrin] 
Nobody is perfect─nobody. And you can't 
change the fact that you're a dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Merrin] 
You have to embrace who you are and what 
you are. You're a dragon, and that's wonderful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Veyle] 
Wonderful?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Merrin] 
Exactly. Dragons are unusual and unique and 
wonderful! You should take pride in that!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Veyle] 
You are very convincing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Veyle] 
If you believe it, then maybe I can try to believe 
it too."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Veyle] 2 
[Merrin] 
Dragon, dragon, dragoooon! You are a 
REAL dragon!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Merrin] 
Do you know how cool that is! I mean, how cool 
you are? So, so, so cool!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Veyle] 
Um..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Veyle] 
I am a dragon. But I'm a Fell Dragon, not 
a Divine Dragon. Aren't you...afraid of me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Merrin] 
Not at all! Honestly, I'm just so happy I have 
this chance to talk with you, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Veyle] 
Oh, I see."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Veyle] 
It's just strange because most people are 
frightened of me...or dislike me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Merrin] 
Well, I'm from a small village, so I can't help 
but admire unique people and unusual things."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Merrin] 
And I could never dislike a being I admire as 
much as I do you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Veyle] 
I am unique and unusual, I suppose."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Merrin] 
I'm sorry, does it bother you that I approached 
you like this?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
No. I don't mind. I think perhaps you are... 
unusual in your own way, aren't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Merrin] 
Me? Unusual? You could say that, I guess. 
That makes us the same, doesn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Veyle] 
Oh!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Merrin] 
I'm so sorry, Lady Veyle. That was awfully 
presumptuous of me. I shouldn't have said that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Veyle] 
No. It's fine. I was just a bit surprised."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Veyle] 
To be honest, I'm happy you thought I might be 
similar to...a human."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Veyle] 
Merrin, why don't we be friends? Two unusual 
people who found one another."
