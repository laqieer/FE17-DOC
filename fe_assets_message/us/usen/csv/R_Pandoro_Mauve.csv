[Pandreo] 
So, what do you say? It was kinda nice to 
relax and break bread together, wasn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
The company was, surprisingly, as wonderful 
as the food."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
I understand now how you think. It is important 
to relax from time to time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Didn't I tell you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Pandreo] 
In that case, let's eat together tomorrow."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Mauvier] 
I am sorry, but no."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Pandreo] 
What? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Mauvier] 
Because it is your turn to experience my 
approach to life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Pandreo] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Mauvier] 
I shall teach you the art of devoting yourself 
entirely to helping others."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Pandreo] 
Well, you did try my way. I guess it's only fair 
that I try your way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Pandreo] 
Who knows. Maybe I'll learn something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Pandreo] 
But after that, you'd better come eat with 
me again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Mauvier] 
I agreed to only the one meal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Now I'm thinking we should switch off. My way 
one day, your way the next..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Mauvier] 
And on and on forever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Exactly! Now, let's join hands and pray again 
for world peace."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Mauvier] 
Hah, you are persistent."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Hey, Mauvier. It's been a while. Want to grab 
a bite somewhere?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Mauvier] 
No, thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, uh, OK. Got other plans?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Mauvier] 
No."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Pandreo] 
Then come on! You need to eat, don't you? 
We can talk about things."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Mauvier] 
I have better ways to spend my day than 
further discussion of our religious beliefs."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Pandreo] 
What if we discussed our hobbies or childhood 
stories? The stuff normal people talk about."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Mauvier] 
You would waste time speaking of trivialities 
when there is suffering in the world?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Last I checked, clerics are allowed to take 
a break every now and then."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Mauvier] 
And while we rest, suffering continues. I must 
remain dedicated to my cause."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Pandreo] 
Uh-huh... How about, just for a lark, you mix 
things up today? Do things my way?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Come on. Those suffering people will still be 
there in an hour, I promise."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Mauvier] 
Your humor lands on deaf ears, Pandreo. Still... 
I will share a meal with you. This one time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Pandreo] 
Huh! That was easier than I expected."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Pandreo] 
I know just the place. It's gonna be great."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Mind if I pray with you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Mauvier] 
I fight alongside you, yet it does not mean my 
faith in the holiness of the Fell Dragon is lost."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Mauvier] 
You are a cleric of the Divine Dragon. It would 
be improper for us to pray beside one another."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Pandreo] 
We believe in different things, but we're both 
men of the cloth. Why sweat the details?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Mauvier] 
""The details"" are what bind us to our faith."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Mauvier] 
It is unconscionable that you would consider 
your vows to be nothing more than ""details."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Pandreo] 
Tell me something. What were you praying for 
just now?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Mauvier] 
We live in an unhealthy world. Prayers for peace 
are required."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Pandreo] 
Well, what do you know? I was about to pray 
for the exact same thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Pandreo] 
The content of our prayers is the same─even if 
the gods receiving them aren't."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Mauvier] 
Hm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Mauvier] 
I have never met a cleric who thinks as you do."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Hahaha! Me neither."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Mauvier] 
Very well. You may pray next to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Good. Come on. If both of us pray for world 
peace, they'll have to make it happen."
