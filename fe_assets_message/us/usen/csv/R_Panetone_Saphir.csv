[Saphir] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Panette] 
Astounding! Two entire hours of kneeling. 
Easily your personal best."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
Is that so? For one such as myself, this interval 
of kneeling is hardly an exertion at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Panette] 
Your speech, too, is flawless."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Panette] 
I never expected you to make so much progress 
in so little time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Panette] 
Impressive work, Saphir. I count myself quite 
proud indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Saphir] 
You are gracious to bestow upon me such lavish 
praise. I am truly flattered."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Saphir] 
And glad to have figured all that stuff out, so 
I can finally go back to talkin' like normal!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Panette] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Panette] 
But why? We have hardly scratched 
the surface!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Saphir] 
Listen, I get that manners are important now. 
But I only needed a handle on the basics."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Saphir] 
Now that I've got it, I can focus on serving 
my kingdom in the way I'm best suited."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Panette] 
Hm... I suppose that makes a kind of sense."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Saphir] 
You've taught me something valuable. Trust me, 
I'm not gonna throw it away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Saphir] 
I'll make an even better knight now that I know 
how not to be an embarrassment."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Panette] 
Haha! Well, it seems my lofty estimation of you 
was exactly on point."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Panette] 
Perhaps I ought to follow your example. You 
know, spend more time training my body."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Saphir] 
I'd be happy to give you a few pointers, 
if you're interested. Fair's fair."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Panette] 
Truly?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Panette] 
Imagine my manners, combined with a well-knit 
physique like yours... I would be flawless!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Panette] 
All right, Saphir. You have yourself a bargain."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Saphir] 
Wondrous, m'lady! Do be certain to prepare 
yourself well, however. We're gonna go hard."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Panette] 
Why, of course! I will become so strong that 
even you kneel at my feet, so to speak."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Saphir] 2 

[Saphir] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Saphir] 
How much longer...do I gotta do this 
kneeling crap?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Panette] 
Ah-ah-ah! Language. Try again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Saphir] 
At what length...did my lady say...I'm to 
continue...this kneeling crap?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Panette] 
Only one hour longer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Panette] 
Any courtier worth her salt must be able to 
kneel for at least that time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Saphir] 
An hour?! Uh... An hour, you say? Indeed?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Saphir] 
That's fine... Only my back's on fire now. 
Legs went numb ages ago..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Saphir] 
Urgh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Saphir] 
AUGH! Forget it! I'm done!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Saphir] 
Only combat's allowed to be this exhausting!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Saphir] 
Sorry, but I'm gonna call it here. This stuff isn't 
for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Saphir] 
My kingdom'll have to make do with my 
strength. They're not getting manners."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Panette] 
Tsk, tsk, tsk! If it tests your endurance, then it 
must be useful training, no?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Panette] 
Here I thought you were made of sterner stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Saphir] 
C'mon..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Panette] 
The Saphir I know would never throw in the 
towel midway through training."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Panette] 
Perhaps I had you mixed up with another, more 
tenacious gray-haired beauty. My mistake."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Saphir] 
Oh, fine!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Saphir] 
You made your point! I'll keep going!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Saphir] 
No way am I gonna quit after you bring 
training into it like that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Panette] 
Good! I would expect nothing less."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Saphir] 
Let it never be said that I didn't fight to the 
bitter end."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Saphir] 
I'm gonna get so prim and proper so fast 
it's gonna make your head spin!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Saphir] 2 

[Saphir] 
Phew! Another glorious sweat. That smell's 
how you know the training's done."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Saphir] 
Right. Next, a bath, then chow."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Panette] 1 

[Panette] 
Saphir, pardon me, but we simply must do 
something about that vulgar tongue of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Saphir] 
Uh, hey, Panette. What's all that, now?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Panette] 
Though we hail from different countries, we are 
both employed in the service of royals."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Panette] 
In our position, one must act─and speak─ 
unimpeachably. At all times."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Saphir] 
Unimpeachably, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Saphir] 
Well, I've talked this way my whole life. Feels 
like I'd remember it being a problem."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Panette] 
Oh, but don't you see? A knight's bearing 
speaks to the bearing of her nation."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Panette] 
If she makes even the smallest misstep, it may 
linger as a national mark of shame!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Saphir] 
Is that right..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Saphir] 
So you're saying if I act how I please, folks'll get 
the wrong idea about my whole kingdom."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Panette] 
Precisely so. I am glad you appreciate the 
gravity of the situation."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Panette] 
But never fear, dearest Saphir!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Panette] 
I shall give you a master class in proper speech 
and manners!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Saphir] 
Uh, OK? Is that...good?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Panette] 
Indeed! I will begin planning. Prepare to learn 
like your life depends on it!"
