[Clanne] 
Ungh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Framme] 
OK, Clanne. Spill it. What are you sulking about?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
Isn't it obvious? The pamphlets."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
I can't believe I was too chicken to hand them 
out. I don't deserve to call myself a fan."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Framme] 
Clanne, does every fiber of your being course 
with passion for the Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Clanne] 
I mean, yeah. You know that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Framme] 
So? There you have it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Framme] 
You're a fan, plain and simple."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Clanne] 
But... But..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Framme] 
Being a fan isn't about what you do. It's about 
what you feel."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Framme] 
If you've got that sweet, dragony passion in 
your heart, you're a Divine Dragon fan!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Clanne] 
Huh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Clanne] 
Yeah. You're right. You're right!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Clanne] 
And you know what? I'm gonna try again. 
I WILL pass out those pamphlets!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Framme] 
That's the spirit!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Clanne] 
But first, I think we better make a few changes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Framme] 
What, right now?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Clanne] 
Right now. You said it yourself. Being a fan is 
about passion. Where's the passion?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Clanne] 
We should write about our experiences with the 
Divine One, so our enthusiasm comes across."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Clanne] 
There aren't enough illustrations either. Let's 
ask for help from someone who can draw."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Clanne] 
And the interview needs...more. We didn't even 
ask if the Divine One prefers red or blue!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Framme] 
Wow. Look at you, all motivated and stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Framme] 
That's the hardworking brother I know and love."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Framme] 
These are gonna be the best pamphlets ever. 
President Clanne, let's get to work."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Clanne] 
It would be my honor, President Framme!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Framme] 2 
[Clanne] 
There are a lot of people here..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Framme] 
Uh, yeah. That's kinda the point."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Framme] 
This is our chance to tell everyone how great 
the Divine Dragon is."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Clanne] 
Yeah, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Framme] 
Come on, we both worked so hard on these, 
we gotta let the people see 'em."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Clanne] 
Or instead, we could quietly put them down 
over there and..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Framme] 
OK, showtime. I'll start us off."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Framme] 
Listen up, everybody! My brother has a reeeal 
important announcement to make."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Clanne] 
Aw..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Framme] 
Psst, Clanne! That was your cue."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Framme] 
You're the one who said people would think 
we're weirdos if we didn't introduce ourselves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Clanne] 
I'm just, uh...kinda nervous?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Framme] 
Everyone's staring at us. This is a real mess."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Framme] 
Fine. I'll introduce both of us, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Clanne] 
O-OK..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Framme] 
All right, then! We are Clanne and Framme, 
the 33rd Stewards of the Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Framme] 
We will answer all your burning questions about 
the Divine One, with these lovely hand-bound─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Clanne] 
Stop! Please stop! This was a bad idea!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Framme] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Clanne] 
I can't do this. There are too many people. 
It's embarrassing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Clanne] 
They're all gonna think we're weird. Who even 
cares about the Divine One's shoe size?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Framme] 
We do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Clanne] 
Ugh, I feel like such a wimp. I thought I could 
be a steward?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Clanne] 
I'm not even cut out to be in the fan club. 
Sorry, Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Framme] 
Clanne, wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Framme] 2 
[Framme] 
It's about that time, President Clanne."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
I'm all set, President Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Framme] 
In that case... I call this meeting of the Divine 
Dragon Fan Club to order!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Framme] 
Woooo!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Clanne] 
Yeaaah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Framme] 
Ahem. Our first and only agenda item is how to 
broaden the fan club's reach."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Framme] 
President Clanne, you have the floor."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Clanne] 
I think we should do something splashy to drum 
up people's excitement."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Framme] 
Seconded!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Framme] 
The only question is...what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Clanne] 
I have an idea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Clanne] 
How about we spread our message by 
making pamphlets?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Framme] 
I'm listening."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Clanne] 
See, everyone's heard of the Divine Dragon. But 
only a few know the person behind the title."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Clanne] 
You and me, we could tell the world what the 
Divine One is really like."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Framme] 
Yeah... Yeah! I'm picking up what you're 
putting down!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Framme] 
Ooo, ooo! How about this─we slap the Divine 
One's beautiful face on the cover, and title it..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Framme] 
""The Divine Dragon: Up Close and Personal."" 
Boom!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Framme] 
Inside, we have an interview with every juicy 
detail folks could possibly wanna know!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Framme] 
Favorite foods, favorite weapons, hair-care 
routine, shoe size. The raw, uncut story!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Framme] 
You don't like it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Clanne] 
I love it! That's way less stiff and formal than 
what I had in mind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Clanne] 
Just the sort of brilliant idea I'd expect from 
you, Madam President!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025,"[Framme] 
I couldn't have gotten there without your 
suggestion, Mr. President!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026,"[Framme] 
All right, let's get working on this pamphlet 
so we can hand it out all over town."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#027,"[Clanne] 
Uh, wait. All over town?"
