[Jean] 
Jade!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Jade] 
Yes, Jean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Jean] 
You had it all wrong! I'm not scared of you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jade] 
But you said it was hard to be around me..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Jean] 
I did, but I wasn't finished..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jean] 
I know that the reason you rush into battle isn't 
because you're bloodthirsty. It's to protect us."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jean] 
But either way, it always puts you on the 
front lines."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Jean] 
So when it's over, you come home hurt worse 
than anyone else. Am I right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jade] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Jean] 
I worry about you. I get so worried sometimes 
I can hardly stand it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Jade] 
Oh, Jean..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jean] 
People who throw themselves into combat like 
you don't tend to live very long."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jean] 
That's what makes you hard to be around─the 
idea that one day you might not be there..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Jean] 
But...I think I've gotten over that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jean] 
However injured you get, I can always heal you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Jean] 
You fight so hard to protect me, so I should do 
my part to keep you alive too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jade] 
That's very noble of you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jean] 
I'm really sorry for the way I acted before."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Jean] 
From now on..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Jade] 
From now on, we'll fight side by side...as allies 
and friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Jean] 
Yes. That's exactly right, Jade."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Jean] 
I'm really glad we've got that straightened out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Jean] 2 
[Jean] 
Jade...I'm really sorry about before."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Jade] 
For saying that it's hard to be near me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Jade] 
Don't worry, Jean. No apology necessary, but 
I would like an explanation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Jade] 
Why do you have a hard time around ""people 
like me""? What does that mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jean] 
Well..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Jean] 
People say that...you're cold─almost inhuman─ 
on the battlefield."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Jade] 
I suppose that's not...always untrue."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Jean] 
Then is it true that you never hesitate to rush 
right into battle?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Jade] 
Ah. Guilty as charged."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Jade] 
Thank you. That's all I needed to hear. 
I understand now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jean] 
You do?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Jade] 
You were living a relatively peaceful life until 
you joined our ranks, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Jade] 
I can see why soldiers with bloody pasts and 
bloodier weapons might make you anxious."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jean] 
U-um, wait, no. That's─ That's not what I..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Jade] 
It's OK, Jean. I'm not judging you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Jade] 
I really do understand. I'll give you some space."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Jade] 
Sorry again for causing discomfort."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Jade] 
[Jean] 
Jade, wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Jean] 2 

[Jade] 
Hello, Jean."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jean] 
Ah! Jade?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Jade] 
Sorry, did I startle you? You look so scared..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Jean] 
Not at all! My heart is beating the 
normal amount."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Jade] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jean] 
So, if you don't need me for anything, I'll just 
be going now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Jade] 
You are scared. Is it me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jade] 
Am I frightening you somehow? I'm not trying 
to be scary..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Jean] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Jean] 
I'm not scared. Really. I just...have a hard time 
around you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jade] 
Around...me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Jean] 
Um, yes. Monsters I can deal with."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Jean] 
Cramped spaces, the dark, bugs, wild animals─ 
none of that stuff is scary to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Jean] 
You...on the other hand..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Jade] 
What are you getting at, Jean?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jean] 
People like you... It's hard for me to... I'm sorry!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Jean] 

[Jade] 
There he goes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Jade] 
I wonder what he meant by ""people like you""..."
