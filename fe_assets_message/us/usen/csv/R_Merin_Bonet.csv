[Merrin] 
OK, Bunet. I came like you asked. What's this 
all about?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Merrin] 
If you try to serve me a flamingo casserole 
or something, I swear, I'll─"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
You have it all wrong. Please, hear me out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Bunet] 
I'm not interested in what you call ""critters."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Bunet] 
Rather, I am interested in...you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Merrin] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Merrin] 
Excuse me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Bunet] 
Though we both serve the royal family, we have 
never had a chance to become friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Bunet] 
I admit, I was too intimidated to approach you. 
You're so confident and outgoing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Bunet] 
Always talking about critters this, critters that 
to anyone who will listen."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Bunet] 
I began to hope that I could one day become 
friends with the Critter Keeper."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Bunet] 
That's my nickname for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Merrin] 
Ooh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Merrin] 
The Critter Keeper, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Bunet] 
Yes. Owing to how deeply you care for 
creatures of the wild."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Bunet] 
It is a rather silly sobriquet, I know..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Merrin] 
Silly? That's the best nickname I've ever heard! 
The Critter Keeper. Makes me sound so...heroic."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Bunet] 
Aha, yes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Merrin] 
I'm sorry, Bunet. I had no idea you wanted to 
be friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Merrin] 
Looks like I was all wrong about you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Bunet] 
There's no need to apologize. I am quite used 
to being misunderstood."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Bunet] 
As a lifelong eccentric, it is something of a 
chronic condition for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Merrin] 
Well, I'm a certified oddball myself, so I know 
the feeling."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Merrin] 
Let's be friends from here on out, yeah? 
We oddballs have to stick together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Bunet] 
I would like that. To celebrate, would you like 
to try my latest dish?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Bunet] 
You can even name it, if you feel so inclined."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Merrin] 
What? Me? You want to put my words on 
your menu?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Bunet] 
Yes. I was quite impressed by your lyrical 
review last time. Pick whatever name you like."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Merrin] 
All right. Hm, what should I call it? Maybe I'll 
name it after a rare critter."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Bunet] 
Yeah... You may want to avoid that. People 
might get the wrong idea..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Merrin] 
Ah! Good point!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Bunet] 
I am in no rush. Take your time with the food 
and allow inspiration to strike."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Merrin] 
It would be my pleasure."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Merrin] 
Hey, Bunet. I heard you're interested in critters."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Bunet] 
Pardon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Merrin] 
As it happens, I'm a fan myself. I know where to 
find some amazing ones in the wild."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Merrin] 
How about I take you? My way of thanking you 
for that delicious meal."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Bunet] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Bunet] 
Thank you for the offer, but I'll decline."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Merrin] 
Oh, really? You don't like wildlife watching?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Bunet] 
That's not quite what I meant..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Merrin] 
What did you mean, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Merrin] 
Wait a second..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Merrin] 
Oh no. I get it now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Bunet] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Merrin] 
You prefer wildlife eating. Is that it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Bunet] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Merrin] 
Cooking with regular meat got boring, so you 
started sourcing meat from rare critters."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Merrin] 
What was in that stew? Did you trick me into 
eating a falcon or something?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Bunet] 
Of course not! I assure you, it was chicken!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Merrin] 
Liar! And I bet you're only cozying up to me so 
I'll show you my favorite wildlife spots."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Bunet] 
Listen─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Merrin] 
No, YOU listen. A crime against the animals is 
a crime against me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Merrin] 
So much as think about hurting another poor 
critter and you're done for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Bunet] 
Merrin, please. You have it all wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Merrin] 
I'll pluck and broil you myself. You hear me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Merrin] 
[Bunet] 
Ugh... I seem to excel at being misunderstood."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Bunet] 
Merrin, your timing could not be more perfect. 
Please, take a seat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Merrin] 
What's this all about?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Bunet] 
I want you to be the first to experience my 
newest recipe."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Merrin] 
Oh. Is this for a cookbook?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Bunet] 
For a restaurant, actually. I want to reestablish 
my parents' bistro after the war is over."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Bunet] 
I have been crafting new dishes for the menu 
in my spare time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Merrin] 
That's great! What are you serving up today?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Bunet] 
Stewed chicken."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Merrin] 
Whoa! High marks on presentation."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Bunet] 
Thank you. I found a rare breed of hen and 
simmered her at low heat for several days."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Bunet] 
There's a variety of spices in the broth, 
including some with salubrious warming effects."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Bunet] 
Here. Have a taste."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Merrin] 
All right, let's give it a try. Here goes..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Merrin] 
Mmm!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Merrin] 
Incredible... The meat is so soft, it's practically 
melting in my mouth."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Merrin] 
Even as the flavors mingle on my tongue, 
each ingredient is still unmistakably itself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Merrin] 
The spices don't blot out the umami taste of 
the chicken. They coexist in perfect harmony."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Bunet] 
I've never heard my cooking described 
so beautifully."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Merrin] 
An artful meal deserves an artful description."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Merrin] 
You really know your way around a bird. This 
definitely deserves a spot on the menu."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Bunet] 
I am glad to hear you say so. That makes all my 
hard work worthwhile."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Bunet] 
Thank you for being my taster, Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Merrin] 
It was seriously my treat. Thank you for the 
delicious meal."
