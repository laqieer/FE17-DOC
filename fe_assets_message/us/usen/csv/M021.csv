Well, don't worry, I haven't forgotten your

MID_BT3_#005,"[Mauvier] Die

Thank you for escorting us."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Marni] 1 
[Marni] 
Mauvier! All ready, like you asked! Feel free to 
tell me how great I am! Wait a minute."
MID_OP1_#004,What's the Divine Dragon doing here?!
MID_OP1_#005,"[Alear] 
Marni?"
MID_OP1_#006,"[Marni] 
What do you want?! We don't have any 
more rings!"
MID_OP1_#007,"[Mauvier] 
There are circumstances that require we travel 
together to Lythos."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Marni] 
Huh?!"
MID_OP1_#009,"[Mauvier] 
Divine Dragon. After Marni and I lost the rings, 
Zephia disciplined us...to an unjust extreme."
MID_OP1_#010,"So, on my honor, I will not betray you once 
at sea. I will deliver you safely to Lythos."
MID_OP1_#011,Will you trust me?
MID_OP1_#012,"[Alear] 
I will. Take us to Lythos."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Marni] 
What?! Why would you help them?! They're 
not our friends. They're enemies!"
MID_OP1_#014,"[Mauvier] 
The Divine Dragon should meet with 
Lady Veyle."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Alear] 
We have no reason to fight. As long as you 
don't start trouble."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Marni] 
I know a threat about not threatening people 
when I hear one. Mauvier! What's happening?!"
MID_OP1_#017,"[Mauvier] 
You will hear details once we're aboard. If that 
is unsatisfactory, then you may remain here."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Marni] 
Hey! What?! Fine! Fine. OK?"
MID_OP1_#019,"Temporary truce until I get back to Zephia 
and the others in Lythos."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Mauvier] 
So be it. Let us go, Divine Dragon."
MID_OP1_#021,"[Alear] 
OK."
MID_OP2_#001,"[Alear] 2 
[Mauvier] 1 
[Marni] 3 
[Marni] 
You're Lord Sombron's child?! What?!"
MID_OP2_#002,"[Alear] 
Yes."
MID_OP2_#003,"[Marni] 
So that means...you're the sibling Lady Veyle 
has been looking for all along?!"
MID_OP2_#004,"And that's why we're headed to Lythos... 
Hang on. Does Griss know about this?"
MID_OP2_#005,"[Alear] 
He's the one who told me."
MID_OP2_#006,"[Mauvier] 
Griss picked a fight at Elusia Castle to verify the 
truth, even surrendering a ring to do so."
MID_OP2_#007,"[Marni] 
What?! Nobody told me that was the plan!"
MID_OP2_#008,"[Alear] 
Why are Sombron and Veyle going to Lythos?"
MID_OP2_#009,"[Mauvier] 
It's about Gradlon, the Fell Dragon's land lost 
under the sea. He intends to restore it."
MID_OP2_#010,"[Vander] 4 

[Vander] 
To restore that unholy land?! My word."
MID_OP2_#011,"[Alear] 
What more do you know about this, Vander?"
MID_OP2_#012,"[Vander] 
Gradlon sank beneath the waves one thousand 
years ago."
MID_OP2_#013,"It was, of course, Sombron's land."
MID_OP2_#014,"Gradlon was a wicked place─one as much 
as Lythos is holy."
MID_OP2_#015,"[Vander] 
[Mauvier] 
To raise and revive it, Sombron needs to 
destroy the Divine Dragon Shard in Lythos."
MID_OP2_#016,"That shard is what chains Gradlon beneath the 
waves. Lord Sombron finds it...problematic."
MID_OP2_#017,"[Alear] 
So, you're saying that Sombron's greatest 
desire...is to restore Gradlon?"
MID_OP2_#018,"[Mauvier] 
Far from it. His desire─if such a word is fitting 
for Lord Sombron─is to invade other worlds."
MID_OP2_#019,"[Alear] 
Other worlds?!"
MID_OP2_#020,"[Mauvier] 
The continent of Elyos is only a stepping-stone. 
He plans to extend himself─everywhere."
MID_OP2_#021,"[Alear] 
There are other worlds, and he wants to rule 
them all. How is that even possible?"
MID_OP2_#022,"[Mauvier] 
I'm well beyond what I know for certain. Lord 
Sombron has shared little of this with me."
MID_OP2_#023,"I can say Lady Veyle is a pawn in service of 
his greater ambitions."
MID_OP2_#024,"[Alear] 
Please, tell me anything more you know."
MID_OP2_#025,"I've heard that Veyle's called a defect. What 
does that even mean?"
MID_OP2_#026,"[Mauvier] 
Well, as a start, dragon royalty should be able to 
summon Emblems. She cannot."
MID_OP2_#027,"Lord Sombron learned this recently, soon after 
his revival, when reunited with Lady Veyle."
MID_OP2_#028,"His children all fought in the war. But she, his 
youngest, never saw battle─or any Emblems."
MID_OP2_#029,"[Alear] 
She told me we met once, all that time ago."
MID_OP2_#030,"[Mauvier] 
You were among her many siblings. They all, 
in time, died fighting in the war."
MID_OP2_#031,All...save for you.
MID_OP2_#032,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_OP2_#033,"[Mauvier] 
Then Sombron was imprisoned and Lady 
Veyle's mother died, leaving her alone."
MID_OP2_#034,"She could find no friends in an age when it was 
rumored a last Fell Dragon child had survived."
MID_OP2_#035,"Lady Veyle lived in hiding, knowing that─were 
she discovered─she would be killed."
MID_OP2_#036,"[Alear] 
A thousand years, living like that... All alone 
that whole time?"
MID_OP2_#037,"[Mauvier] 
Not exactly. A few centuries ago, she came into 
contact with worshippers of the Fell Dragon..."
MID_OP2_#038,"In their care, she slept in a hidden temple─until 
Lord Sombron's release."
MID_OP2_#039,"She had been, long ago, close with those in 
that temple. But when she recently awoke..."
MID_OP2_#040,"[Alear] 
They were all dead, weren't they..."
MID_OP2_#041,"[Mauvier] 
So, Lady Veyle was relieved, even overjoyed, 
to find herself reunited with Lord Sombron."
MID_OP2_#042,"He detested her and proclaimed her a defect 
lacking a Fell Dragon's abilities and character."
MID_OP2_#043,"Sombron required her obedience, however, so 
he ordered Zephia to tamper with her nature."
MID_OP2_#044,"Lady Veyle may have thought she was no longer 
alone, but she's never been more so...ever."
MID_OP2_#045,"[Alear] 
How awful..."
MID_OP2_#046,"[Marni] 
..."
MID_OP2_#047,"[Mauvier] 
What is it, Marni? Is it the waves? Are 
you seasick?"
MID_OP2_#048,"[Marni] 
No! I'm trying not to cry! But...I never knew 
Lady Veyle's life was so sad."
MID_OP2_#049,"I thought I was the one with the tragic story. 
I should've maybe been nicer to her, probably."
MID_OP2_#050,"[Mauvier] 
You have never told me of your past, Marni."
MID_OP2_#051,"[Marni] 
I mean, you know, happens all the time... I was 
just abandoned by my mom, that's all."
MID_OP2_#052,"I had a lot─a lot─of brothers, and she decided 
she didn't need a girl."
MID_OP2_#053,"Which is weird since I was way superior to 
those useless jerks, even back then..."
MID_OP2_#054,"I mean, I was better at helping her, but she 
never said thank you or good job...or anything."
MID_OP2_#055,"The first time we went for a walk, just us, was 
so she could find somewhere to dump me."
MID_OP2_#056,"Imagine, my hand in hers, and we're strolling 
from place to place. She left me at a church."
MID_OP2_#057,"[Alear] 
I can't believe it..."
MID_OP2_#058,"[Marni] 
It's fine! The priest was nice. Long as I helped 
free Lord Sombron, I got lots of thank-yous."
MID_OP2_#059,"Eventually, I met Zephia and joined the Hounds. 
See? Lady Veyle's story is so much sadder."
MID_OP2_#060,"[Mauvier] 
Zephia filled out the Four Hounds with devout 
followers of the Fell Dragon."
MID_OP2_#061,"[Alear] 
Did that include you, Mauvier?"
MID_OP2_#062,"[Mauvier] 
Yes. I was there at the hidden temple where 
Lady Veyle slept. When she awoke..."
MID_OP2_#063,"I was there to speak with her. She, a royal 
dragon, asked me to be her friend."
MID_OP2_#064,"I said it was impossible. Lady Veyle then asked 
if I could offer my service to her as a knight."
MID_OP2_#065,"[Alear] 
And you accepted."
MID_OP2_#066,"[Mauvier] 
That I could not refuse."
MID_OP2_#067,"[Marni] 
It's a big deal to be hand-picked like that, 
by royalty. Who woulda thought!"
MID_OP2_#068,"You, made her knight? That's just cool. I mean 
that, Mauvier. That's really cool."
MID_OP2_#069,"[Mauvier] 
Should you wish, I am sure Lady Veyle would 
also accept you as her knight."
MID_OP2_#070,"[Marni] 
What? No way. I don't wanna work with you 
that much. No praise, no thank-yous. I hate you."
MID_OP2_#071,"[Mauvier] 
Is that so?"
MID_OP2_#072,"[Marni] 
Besides, I already belong somewhere. I need to 
get back to Zephia."
MID_OP2_#073,"Since you're helping the Divine Dragon, you're 
probably gonna get kicked out of the Hounds."
MID_OP2_#074,"[Mauvier] 
I expect as much."
MID_OP2_#075,"[Marni] 
Yeah, well, I like being one of the Four Hounds. 
As soon as we're off this boat, we're enemies."
MID_OP2_#076,"[Mauvier] 
You do hate me, after all. So surely, you'll 
be happier."
MID_OP2_#077,"[Marni] 
Right, so... Yes. I'm done talking. This is a 
waste of my time."
MID_OP2_#078,"[Marni] 

[Alear] 
Mauvier, thank you for telling us all of that."
MID_OP2_#079,"When we find Veyle, I hope you will do what 
you think is best for her."
MID_OP2_#080,Even if that means we'll cross blades again.
MID_OP2_#081,"[Mauvier] 
I shall."
MID_OP3_#001,"[Alear] 2 

[Vander] 1 

[Alear] 
What's happened to Lythos? The land─it's 
fallen to rot and ruin."
MID_OP3_#002,"[Vander] 
A sure sign of Gradlon's return, or that our foes 
are now destroying the Divine Dragon Shard."
MID_OP3_#003,"[Alear] 
We have to stop Sombron. Where is the shard?"
MID_OP3_#004,"[Vander] 
It's in the castle─Queen Lumera's home."
MID_OP3_#005,"[Alear] 
Who would have thought we'd return here 
to see everything...come to this."
MID_OP4_#001,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
I know you're here, Sombron! Show yourself!"
MID_OP4_#002,"[Zephia] 1 
[Zephia] 
Ah, the Divine Dragon has arrived."
MID_OP4_#003,"Or should I call you the ""Divine Impostor""?"
MID_OP4_#004,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_OP4_#005,"[Zephia] 
You've arrived earlier than expected. How did 
you know where to find us?"
MID_OP4_#006,"My other two children haven't even caught 
up to us yet..."
MID_OP4_#007,"[Alear] 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Marni] 4 
[Mauvier] 
I assume you mean us."
MID_OP4_#008,"[Griss] 3 
[Griss] 
Why are you with them?!"
MID_OP4_#009,"[Zephia] 
You two brought them here? And betrayed us? 
Unbelievable."
MID_OP4_#010,"[Marni] 
Please, no! You have it wrong!"
MID_OP4_#011,"[Griss] 
Wrong?! Tch, looks pretty clear to me."
MID_OP4_#012,"[Mauvier] 
This is my doing. I want Lady Veyle to meet 
with the Divine Dragon."
MID_OP4_#013,"I might have even forced them to come. But it 
wasn't necessary. Marni had no part in this."
MID_OP4_#014,"[Marni] 
Mauvier..."
MID_OP4_#015,"[Mauvier] 
Return to the Hounds, Marni."
MID_OP4_#016,"[Marni] 
B-but..."
MID_OP4_#017,"[Mauvier] 
Do not hesitate. Go. Now!"
MID_OP4_#018,"[Marni] 
[Zephia] 
Marni, welcome back. But, Mauvier, what will 
we do with you?"
MID_OP4_#019,"I'm willing to forgive and forget, if you can 
explain yourself. We are family, after all."
MID_OP4_#020,"[Mauvier] 
What nonsense. I know you're going to punish 
me. But Lady Veyle will see the Divine Dragon."
MID_OP4_#021,"[Zephia] 
You rude, self-serving..."
MID_OP4_#022,"[Griss] 
[Veyle] 3 

[Veyle] 
I don't mind. I was just thinking I'd like to talk 
to the Divine Dragon myself."
MID_OP5C_#001,"[Marni] 
HYAAAH!"
MID_OP5C_#002,...
MID_OP5C_#003,"[Veyle] 
Marni, that was simply pathetic. An attack like that 
couldn't put a scratch on Father's gift."
MID_OP5C_#004,"[Marni] 
I swung with all my strength, and it did nothing?"
MID_OP5C_#005,"[Veyle] 
I take it you were trying to free me, fool that you are. 
But as it turns out, you have failed in your attempt."
MID_OP5C_#006,"[Marni] 
No..."
MID_OP5C_#007,"[Zephia] 
I ordered you to stop, did I not?"
MID_OP5C_#008,Such a bad girl.
MID_OP5C_#009,"[Marni] 
I..."
MID_OP5C_#010,"[Alear] 4 

[Alear] 
..."
MID_OP5C_#011,"[Zephia] 
You are a very naughty child. If only you had 
done as I had said..."
MID_OP5C_#012,"[Marni] 
Ze...phi...a..."
MID_OP5C_#013,"[Marni] 

[Alear] 
[Mauvier] 4 
[Mauvier] 
Marni!"
MID_OP5C_#014,"[Marni] 2 
[Marni] 
Mauvier..."
MID_OP5C_#015,"I'm sorry... I tried to save her, but...in the end, 
I guess...I wasn't strong enough."
MID_OP5C_#016,"If she's...ever her old self again...will you tell her 
something for me?"
MID_OP5C_#017,"Please tell her that...she's done...so well, huh?"
MID_OP5C_#018,...
MID_OP5C_#019,"[Mauvier] 
Don't go... Please! Marni!"
MID_OP5C_#020,"[Marni] 
..."
MID_OP5C_#021,"[Marni] 
[Zephia] 
Aw, did she die in your arms? How very tragic..."
MID_OP5C_#022,"[Veyle] 

[Griss] 1 
[Griss] 
What a waste. Got killed for nothing."
MID_OP5C_#023,"[Mauvier] 
AAAH!"
MID_OP5_#001,"[Alear] 2 
[Veyle] 黒 悪 1 
[Mauvier] 4 

[Alear] 
Veyle? What's happened to you?"
MID_OP5_#002,"[Veyle] 黒 悪 
Hehehe... It's good to see you again."
MID_OP5_#003,"[Mauvier] 
What did you do to Lady Veyle?"
MID_OP5_#004,"[Zephia] 3 
[Zephia] 
I told you about Lord Sombron's enchanted 
helmet. My spell has now truly taken hold."
MID_OP5_#005,"[Alear] 
Veyle, do you know who I am?!"
MID_OP5_#006,"[Veyle] 黒 悪 
Why, you're my dear long-lost brother. 
What a happy reunion."
MID_OP5_#006_F,"[Veyle] 黒 悪 
Why, you're my dear long-lost sister. 
What a happy reunion."
MID_OP5_#007,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_OP5_#008,"[Alear] 
[Mauvier] 
[Marni] 2 
[Marni] 
What the... This is what you've been trying to 
do to her? Can the other Lady Veyle return?"
MID_OP5_#009,"[Zephia] 
No, never. Not as long as that helmet remains 
attached and intact."
MID_OP5_#010,That other side of her is dead.
MID_OP5_#011,"[Marni] 
D-dead?"
MID_OP5_#012,"[Zephia] 
Oh, please. You should be delighted. You don't 
have to talk to the defect anymore."
MID_OP5_#013,"[Marni] 
Zephia, I know about Veyle's past... Do you? 
You were alive way back then..."
MID_OP5_#014,"[Zephia] 
What?"
MID_OP5_#015,"[Marni] 
I mean, I didn't know...when I helped you with 
all of these awful things."
MID_OP5_#016,"Lady Veyle was all alone for so long. And she 
was so excited to see her family again."
MID_OP5_#017,"She never got to enjoy it. And now she 
never will. It's all so terrible..."
MID_OP5_#018,"[Zephia] 
What is this, Marni?"
MID_OP5_#019,"[Marni] 
Zephia, I loved it when you gave me praise."
MID_OP5_#020,"I loved it when you said we were family. I loved 
belonging somewhere. I loved the Four Hounds."
MID_OP5_#021,But this has gone too far.
MID_OP5_#022,"I have to do what I know is right, praise 
or no praise."
MID_OP5_#023,"[Zephia] 
Marni?!"
MID_OP5_#024,"[Marni] 
I'm going to free Lady Veyle! I'm going to break 
that helmet to pieces!"
MID_OP5_#025,"[Zephia] 
No! Stop!"
MID_OP5_2_#001,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Marni was just...trying to restore Veyle."
MID_OP5_2_#002,And all this...for that?
MID_OP5_2_#003,"[Mauvier] 3 
[Mauvier] 
I will never stand by you again, Zephia. Save for 
the moment my blade pierces your heart!"
MID_OP5_2_#004,"Divine Dragon, I beg of you! Allow me to fight 
at your side."
MID_OP5_2_#005,"To avenge Marni, and to save Lady Veyle."
MID_OP5_2_#006,"[Alear] 
Mauvier, of course."
MID_OP5_2_#007,"[Griss] 
[Veyle] 黒 悪 1 
[Veyle] 黒 悪 
So, you're just going to betray me? Leave me 
sad and lonely again?"
MID_OP5_2_#008,"And you, Brother. I thought you'd be happy to 
be reunited with me after...so long."
MID_OP5_2_#008_F,"And you, Sister. I thought you'd be happy to 
be reunited with me after...so long."
MID_OP5_2_#009,
MID_OP5_2_#010,"[Alear] 
You are not our Veyle."
MID_OP5_2_#011,"[Veyle] 黒 悪 
This must be about my new look. Then you're 
not going to like this look either."
MID_OP5_2_#012,"[Zephia] 
[Marth] 3 

[Alear] 
Marth."
MID_OP5_2_#013,"[Veyle] 黒 悪 
His fellow Emblems, stolen away. You turned 
your back on him. Oh, lonely thing."
MID_OP5_2_#014,"Just like me. But I'm here for you, little Emblem. 
I'm all you need."
MID_OP5_2_#015,"Now, had I known I had a sibling who survived 
the years...I would have killed you."
MID_OP5_2_#016,"I'd like to make sure I'm my Father's one 
and only child."
MID_OP5_2_#017,"[Alear] 
You want to be alone forever?"
MID_OP5_2_#018,"[Veyle] 黒 悪 
Yes, that's right. I have no need for this sort of 
family, or friendships, or bonds of loyalty."
MID_OP5_2_#019,"I do appreciate you bringing the rings to me, 
but that's where our relationship ends..."
MID_OP5_2_#020,"Now, goodbye, Brother."
MID_OP5_2_#020_F,"Now, goodbye, Sister."
MID_OP5_2_#021,
MID_OP5_2_#022,"[Alear] 
Veyle..."
