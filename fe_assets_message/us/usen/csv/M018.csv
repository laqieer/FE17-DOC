Elusia is in sight."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Ivy] 
So...I've returned."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alear] 
Are you all right?"
MID_ED1_#004,"[Ivy] 
Whatever has become of Elusia, I'll still do what 
I must."
MID_ED1_#005,"Givre Port is a little farther north. I suggest 
sailing there."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
Understood."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Ivy] 
It's near the castle and the cathedral, so we 
should be able to gather intel there."
MID_ED1_#008,I will inform the others of our destination.

MID_ED1_#010,"Marth, Celica, Micaiah, Roy... We've returned

[Sigurd] 
Elusia..."
MID_ED2_#002,"A return, then, to the land where we were 
separated from our fellow Emblems."
MID_ED2_#003,"[Lucina] 
If reunited, we can at last grant the power we 
offer once every thousand years."
MID_ED2_#004,"[Sigurd] 
We should discuss our...other option. That is, 
the far greater power only we know about."
MID_ED2_#005,"[Lucina] 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Yes, of course. The miracle. We could use that 
power at long last. I would suggest...Lumera."
MID_ED2_#006,"[Sigurd] 
[Ike] 1 
[Ike] 
I don't like this idea."
MID_ED2_#007,"We shouldn't perform the miracle. We have 
to think of the future."
MID_ED2_#008,"[Eirika] 

[Lyn] 2 
[Lyn] 
I agree. The whole future. We can't favor 
anyone with it now."
MID_ED2_#009,"[Ike]

Favor someone? We're talking about Lumera. 
We can prevent a tragedy."
MID_ED2_#010,"[Lyn]

Please, those of us who were scattered in other 
lands are still learning all that's happened."

[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Some of us were at her castle. Some were not. 
It's natural to see things differently."
MID_ED2_#012,"So, we are not all in agreement. At least, 
at present."
MID_ED2_#013,"[Leif] 
[Lucina] 1 
[Lucina] 
Using our power every thousand years is one 
thing. The miracle, we've never used it before."
MID_ED2_#014,Never in all of existence...
MID_ED2_#015,"[Byleth] 
[Sigurd] 2 

[Sigurd] 
The cost of doing so is not small. Perhaps we 
should never, ever use it."
MID_ED2_#016,Hmm...

others think? What might they decide?"

Veyle gave the Ring of the Holy Knight to the 
Divine Dragon..."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Zephia] 
Apologies, my lord."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Sombron] 
The Ring of Azure Twins lost as well. Twice my 
Four Hounds failed me."
MID_OP1_#004,You do understand the gravity of all this.
MID_OP1_#005,"[Zephia] 
Yes."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Sombron] 
And Veyle?"
MID_OP1_#007,"[Zephia] 
Still in a deep slumber."
MID_OP1_#008,"No matter how much I amplify her draconic 
impulses, she won't awaken."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Sombron] 
She refuses her true nature... In that case, 
take this."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Zephia] 
Ah... What is it?"
MID_OP1_#011,"[Sombron] 
An enchanted helmet. It will strengthen the 
spell you cast on her."
MID_OP1_#012,"My power, with your spell, will correct what is 
wrong with Veyle."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Zephia] 
I see."
MID_OP1_#014,"[Sombron] 
Keep it safe. Use it when the time is right."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Zephia] 
Of course. As you will it."
MID_OP1_#016,There is...something else I would like to discuss.
MID_OP1_#017,"[Sombron] 
What?"
MID_OP1_#018,"[Zephia] 
Pardon me, Lord Sombron, but... Lady Veyle is 
your only child, correct?"
MID_OP1_#019,"[Sombron] 
My only living child."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Zephia] 
Yes."
MID_OP1_#021,"[Sombron] 
That is correct."
MID_OP1_#022,"[Zephia] 
Of course. I was speaking from fear, not fact. 
Forgive me."
MID_OP1_#023,"[Sombron] 
Why ask such a thing?"
MID_OP1_#024,"[Zephia] 
Veyle believes one of her siblings is alive. 
I thought it best to raise with you."
MID_OP1_#025,She spoke of an unbroken dragonstone.
MID_OP1_#026,"[Sombron] 
Hmm."
MID_OP1_#027,"[Zephia] 
But she must be mistaken. We both know 
the truth."
MID_OP1_#028,"Your children were killed in the war a thousand 
years ago. All but Veyle."
MID_OP1_#029,"I remember one who stood above the rest, 
with hair and eyes like fire."
MID_OP1_#030,What was the name again? Something like...
MID_OP1_#031,"[Sombron] 
Zephia."
MID_OP1_#032,"[Zephia] 
My lord."
MID_OP1_#033,"[Sombron] 
I do not remember all my children's names 
or faces. But that one I killed myself."
MID_OP1_#034,"[Zephia] 
Yes."
MID_OP1_#035,"[Sombron] 
Moments later, I was imprisoned. Did you 
collect the body?"
MID_OP1_#036,"[Zephia] 
I... I did not."
MID_OP1_#037,"[Sombron] 
Then I rescind what I said."
MID_OP1_#038,"[Zephia] 
..."
MID_OP1_#039,"[Sombron] 
The answer is no."
MID_OP1_#040,"And if you find that offspring...bring me a 
corpse this time."
MID_OP1_#041,"[Zephia] 
Yes, Lord Sombron. As you wish."
MID_OP2_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Thanks for arranging this ship for us, Alfred."
MID_OP2_#002,"[Alfred] 
Thank my mother, not me."
MID_OP2_#003,"When I said we were headed to Elusia, she got 
one of the fleet's finest lined up."
MID_OP2_#004,"[Alear] 
How was everything at the capital?"
MID_OP2_#005,"[Alfred] 
Well enough. There haven't been any attacks 
since we left for Brodia."
MID_OP2_#006,"[Alear] 
What a relief."
MID_OP2_#007,"[Alfred] 
I told Mother what the other side's been up to. 
How they're after ""sovereign blood."""
MID_OP2_#008,"She was shocked, of course, to hear about 
King Morion and King Hyacinth."
MID_OP2_#009,"[Alear] 
Understandably so."
MID_OP2_#010,"[Alfred] 
As for the destruction at Florra Port, the royal 
family will spare no expense on aid."
MID_OP2_#011,"Though it may be years before the harbor is 
returned to its original beauty."
MID_OP2_#012,"[Alear] 
We must defeat the Fell Dragon so that such 
horrors never happen again."
MID_OP2_#013,"[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
What's our plan? When we arrive, do we head 
straight for Elusia Castle?"
MID_OP2_#014,"[Alear] 
First, we should try to learn what we can from 
the Elusian people."
MID_OP2_#015,"Rings or no rings, if we don't know what we're 
up against, we could lose everything."
MID_OP2_#016,Besides...there's something I need to find out.
MID_OP2_#017,"[Diamant] 
And what's that?"
MID_OP2_#018,"[Alear] 
Whether Veyle is all right."
MID_OP2_#019,"[Diamant] 
Hm. From our vantage, the Hounds certainly 
didn't seem pleased."
MID_OP2_#020,"[Diamant] 
[Ivy] 3 

[Ivy] 
They may attempt to erase her personality. 
If anyone can do it, that woman can."
MID_OP2_#021,"[Alear] 
I know Veyle killed my mother. Nothing we've 
learned changes that."
MID_OP2_#022,"But I can't help but worry about her. I hope 
she's not hurt."
MID_OP2_#023,"[Alfred] 
Yes, I suppose she's a victim in this too. And 
she did risk her neck to give us the ring."
MID_OP2_#024,"[Alfred] 

[Timerra] 1 

[Timerra] 
Or it was all an act, and she's just gaining our 
trust to stab us in the back. Again."
MID_OP2_#025,"[Ivy] 
[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
That's worth considering. We don't know 
enough to rule anything out."
MID_OP2_#026,"[Alear] 
Still...I want to trust her."
MID_OP2_#027,"[Vander] 4 

[Vander] 
Divine One, excuse me. Two ships flying 
Elusian colors approach from ahead."
MID_OP2_#028,"[Alear] 
Any sign of the Hounds?"
MID_OP2_#029,"[Vander] 
None. However...it appears the enemy intends 
to attack us."
MID_OP2_#030,"[Alear] 
Then we've got no choice but to fight them on 
the water. Prepare for battle, everyone!"

left the castle, but..."

time thereafter."

would be proud to fight by your side."
