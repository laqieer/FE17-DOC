[Pandreo] 
AROOO! Who's ready to get their howl on?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
Awoo..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Louder, Lady Veyle!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
I─ I'm a bit embarrassed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Pandreo] 
This party was your idea! You wanted to give 
something back, remember?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Pandreo] 
If you want folks to let loose, you've got to lead 
by example."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Veyle] 
Yes, you're right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
I wanted to show everyone how grateful I am, 
and you made this party happen. So here goes..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Veyle] 
Awoo! Thank you so much for coming 
everyone!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Veyle] 
You gave me gifts─and the gift of happiness! 
In return, I hope you enjoy this celebration!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Looks like folks are clearing out. Time for us to 
clean up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Veyle] 
I had...so much...fun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Veyle] 
The party...it was amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Veyle] 
Everyone was so nice to me, and you wouldn't 
believe all the good conversations I had."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Veyle] 
I felt like I was dreaming."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Pandreo] 
I told you, didn't I? They know that 
you've changed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Veyle] 
I wonder if some people still distrust me. 
You know, deep down."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Veyle] 
But at least they got to know the new me 
a little bit. The real me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Veyle] 
Pandreo, I don't want this day to end."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Pandreo] 
No need to worry. We can have another bash."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Veyle] 
Oh good!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Pandreo] 
Though of course, we wouldn't want people to 
think you don't take the war seriously."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Pandreo] 
I suggest holding off on any more parties until 
the world is at peace."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Veyle] 
Of course. You're right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Pandreo] 
Meanwhile, you can depend on me. You're 
easily one of my favorite dragons, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Veyle] 
Thank you, Pandreo, for everything 
you've done."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Veyle] 
I will do my best to bring peace to our world. 
That would truly be something to celebrate."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Um, Pandreo?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Hey, is something the matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Veyle] 
I don't understand. How did I end up with all 
this food?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Let's see...vegetables, wheat, meat, fish. 
That's quite a haul you've got."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Veyle] 
There's so much, I don't even know what to 
do with it all!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Veyle] 
Why is everyone sending me these gifts?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Pandreo] 
They're not gifts exactly. They're offerings. 
People's way of expressing their faith in you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Veyle] 
I understand that the people who live in the 
queendom of Solm are quite free-spirited..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Veyle] 
But why are you...why is everyone...being so 
kind to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Veyle] 
It's just...it doesn't make sense."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Pandreo] 
Well, as angry and vengeful as humans can be, 
they can also be compassionate, forgiving."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Pandreo] 
Many people, in Solm and beyond, recognize 
that you've changed for the better."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Pandreo] 
I'm sure if they met you in person, they would 
show you nothing but kindness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Veyle] 
They would? Really?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Veyle] 
If that's how it is, I suppose I'd like to give 
something back to everyone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Veyle] 
They've given me the gift of happiness, and 
I want to repay them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Pandreo] 
I like it. What did you have in mind?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lady Veyle, can I have a moment?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Veyle] 
Yes, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Pandreo] 
As a man of the church, I worship the 
Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Pandreo] 
So I was wondering... Can I pray to you too?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Veyle] 
Oh, um..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Veyle] 
I don't think that's a good idea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Pandreo] 
Why not? You're a dragon, aren't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Pandreo] 
Dragons are sacred creatures. It's natural for 
humans to worship them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Veyle] 
Yes, I understand. But I'm not a Divine Dragon. 
I'm a Fell Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Veyle] 
As a cleric who worships the Divine Dragon, 
wouldn't it be...wrong for you to worship me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Pandreo] 
Divine Dragon, Fell Dragon... A distinction 
without a difference."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
But you must know what I've done."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Veyle] 
Your fellow worshippers would turn on you 
if you started praying to someone like me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Pandreo] 
No. Solm is an open-minded queendom."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Pandreo] 
When they see me praying to you, others will 
follow suit. Just you watch."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Veyle] 
Oh, I─ I don't think that's a good idea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Pandreo] 
You're overthinking it. Trust me on this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Veyle] 
But...what if you're wrong?"
