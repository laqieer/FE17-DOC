[Hortensia] 
Hey, Lady Anna? Can I talk to you for a minute?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Anna] 
Oh, Princess Hortensia! How'd it go with that 
perfume? Ready to place a full order yet?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
I've decided not to buy any, actually."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Anna] 
Huh? Did it not work?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Hortensia] 
Oh, no, it worked great. My whole look came 
together. I was the center of attention."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Even so...the perfume's not for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Anna] 
But why? You seemed like you had your heart 
set on being popular."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Hortensia] 
I love wearing makeup and perfume, but I think 
I'll steer clear of the enchanted stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Magic is a shortcut. I want people to be wowed 
by my cuteness and charm─not by a gimmick."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Anna] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Anna] 
Sorry, Princess Hortensia. I guess I pitched you 
the wrong product."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Hortensia] 
No, it was exactly what I needed at the time. 
I wouldn't have realized how I felt otherwise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Hortensia] 
Really, I'm nothing but grateful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Anna] 
Whoa."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Anna] 
You're more amazing to me now than when you 
were wearing that perfume."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Aw, thanks! From now on, my charm is gonna 
be just that. No quick fixes. All me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Anna] 
And I'm gonna keep building my business until 
I'm the number-one merchant in the world!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Hortensia] 
Sounds like a plan, young lady."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Anna] 
On that note, do you want to have another look 
at my non-magical beauty line?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Anna] 
Beauty products or otherwise, I've got all the 
tools you need in your quest for popularity!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Hortensia] 
Haha, go on, you smooth talker!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1

[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Anna] 
Why the long face, Princess Hortensia?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Hortensia] 
I tried your whole beauty line, but something's 
still not quite right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Anna] 
Are you saying...you're a dissatisfied customer?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Hortensia] 
No, the products are great... They're just not 
making me as happy as I thought they would."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Anna] 
Don't be so sure! My beauty line is tried, tested, 
and terrific."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Anna] 
It's expanded a bit since last time too. I'm now 
stocking my own brand of magic perfume."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Hortensia] 
Magic perfume? Is that a thing?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Anna] 
Yup. This enchanted aroma will put your 
cuteness over the top for sure."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Anna] 
Its magical potency more than makes up for the 
lack of staying power. I'd swear by it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Hortensia] 
It can really do all that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Anna] 
Don't take my word for it. Give it a try!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Hortensia] 
Ooo, that does smell delightful! Let's see what 
a spritz does for me. What do you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Anna] 
Whoa! I think we found the missing piece of the 
puzzle! It works even better than I thought!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Really? My image is finally complete? 
I'm entirely irresistible?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Anna] 
Oh, absolutely!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Anna] 
Tell you what, I'll give you a little as a sample. 
If you like it, come back and buy it, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Hortensia] 
This army's too pretty. It's not right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Hortensia] 
How am I supposed to be the cutest when the 
competition is this gorgeous?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Anna] 2 
[Anna] 
Aha, say no more!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Wait, you're..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Anna] 
Only a troubled maiden's best friend─the one 
and only Lady Anna! Cha-ching!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Anna] 
If it's cuteness you're after, Princess Hortensia, 
you might be interested in my beauty line!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Hortensia] 
You have my attention! I should tell you, 
though, I'm kinda picky about product."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Anna] 
I guarantee satisfaction with everything I sell."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Anna] 
After all, what I've got on offer today is tailored 
just for you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Hortensia] 
You're confident. I like that. OK, show me what 
you got."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Anna] 
Of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Anna] 
First is this pink rouge. Just a dab stays on all 
day. Apply it in the morning and forget about it!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Hortensia] 
Ooo..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Anna] 
There's also lipstick, soap, skin cleanser, and 
a crystal enchanted to add shine to your hair."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Anna] 
And finally, an accessory case to hold it all. The 
rainbow palette makes you cute just holding it!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Hortensia] 
These are...INCREDIBLE! I've gotta have 'em─ 
I'll take 'em all!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Anna] 
Thanks for the business! Ooh, I'm making 
a killing!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Hortensia] 
You deserve it─your stuff's impressive. 
I'm gonna be more adorable than ever!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Anna] 
Indulge me in a little market research. Why do 
you want to be cute, Princess Hortensia?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Hortensia] 
Uh, because the cuter you are, the more people 
like you, obviously."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Anna] 
So it's a popularity thing for you, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Hortensia] 
Of course. Anyway, I'm off─gotta see how all 
this is gonna come together for my look."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Hortensia] 
Thanks, Lady Anna!"
