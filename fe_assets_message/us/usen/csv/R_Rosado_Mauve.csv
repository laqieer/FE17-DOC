[Rosado] 
Hi, Mauvier."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Rosado. Have you come to lecture me again on 
""cute""? I thought I made my stance clear?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
You did. And I know, my timing wasn't great."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Rosado] 
I don't think someone as kind and focused as 
you can put the war aside until it's over."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Mauvier] 
I am rather focused, yes. Lack of focus leads to 
defeat─in battle and in life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Mauvier] 
You have seen what I could not. If I had realized 
it myself, I could have spared you the trouble."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Mauvier] 
For that, I apologize."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Rosado] 
No, don't apologize! But if it's OK with you, 
I'd like us to make a promise to each other."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Mauvier] 
What kind of promise?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Rosado] 
Once the war is over, once there's peace, let's 
make it a point to broaden your horizons."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Mauvier] 
Once there is peace, you say."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Mauvier] 
Heh, you are a strange one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Mauvier] 
I think you would be more fulfilled if you spent 
your days with other people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Rosado] 
I'm not making this promise with them, though. 
I'm making it with you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Mauvier] 
I...appreciate that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Rosado] 
So can we call it a promise? We'll explore the 
cuteness of the world together in peacetime?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Mauvier] 
If that would please you, then yes. We shall 
travel whenever you like."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Mauvier] 
Together, we shall see ""cute,"" and we will eat 
only the spiciest of stews."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Rosado] 
Oh, uh... Right, spicy stews! Sure, whatever's 
fun for you─we'll do it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Mauvier] 
Heh, I look forward to it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 

[Rosado] 
OK, look at this accessory case. Seems kind of 
ordinary, right? Wrong! Bunny ears!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Rosado] 
Isn't that the most adorable thing you've 
ever seen?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Mauvier] 
I agree that it looks like a rabbit, yes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Rosado] 
OK...more straightforward. What about this 
handkerchief? It's got pretty summer flowers!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Mauvier] 
Hmm... The embroidery is quite well done."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Mauvier] 
But as for what is ""cute"" about it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Mauvier] 
I am sorry. I cannot see what it is you want me 
to see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Rosado] 
Hmm... You're a tough one, but I still think we 
can make headway. Let's get down to basics."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Rosado] 
Think of a time in your life when your pulse 
was racing. When your heart fluttered!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Mauvier] 
Fluttered?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Rosado] 
You know... ""Ah, it's so cute! I can't stand it! If 
I must look a moment longer, I fear I will die!"""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Rosado] 
Like that!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Mauvier] 
Oh, I know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Mauvier] 
My heart did flutter when I was struck by an 
enemy's poisoned arrow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Rosado] 
There's nothing cute about poison..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Mauvier] 
I am sorry. I do not think I can learn the ways 
of ""cute."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Mauvier] 
As a child, my education by worshippers of the 
Fell Dragon was a time of great suffering."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Mauvier] 
Their brainwashing did not work, yet I was left 
with absolutely no connection to ""cute."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Mauvier] 
I do not believe I am capable of learning its 
meaning now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Rosado] 
Mauvier...don't give up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Mauvier] 
My apologies. I must be going."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 

[Rosado] 
Hey, Mauvier!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Rosado."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Rosado] 
Are you always this, ah...tense?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Mauvier] 
I do not intend to be."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Rosado] 
Come on, relax! How can you stay grumpy 
looking at this cute face?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Mauvier] 
Grumpy? Well, such is my life."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Mauvier] 
As for ""cute,"" I have little experience. Please see 
my reaction as uneducated, rather than rude."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Rosado] 
Oh, that's it! I think I get it now!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Mauvier] 
Get what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Rosado] 
You're uninitiated. You haven't developed your 
cute sense! No wonder you're a bit of a grump!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Rosado] 
I can help with that. Let me teach you all about 
cuteness appreciation! Get you enjoying life!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Mauvier] 
That is not necessary."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Rosado] 
Are you kidding? It's top priority!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Rosado] 
Not being able to feel cuteness is like...it's like 
not being able to taste the heat in a spicy stew!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Mauvier] 
Hmm... I do appreciate a spicy stew. OK, then. 
Teach me about cuteness."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Rosado] 
Yes! Leave it to me─you're gonna love this!"
