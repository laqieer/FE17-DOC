[Jade] 
Bunet, do you have a spare moment?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
Ah, Jade. I do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
Is that a flower I smell?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jade] 
I wanted to thank you for cooking that delicious 
meal the other day. This flower is for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Bunet] 
For me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Bunet] 
I'm touched. Would you be offended if I took 
a little nibble from one of the petals?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jade] 
You want to know what flowers from a friend 
taste like, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Bunet] 
I didn't realize you had taken up mind reading."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jade] 
I've experienced enough of your habits to 
detect a pattern."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Bunet] 
I see. Well, understanding cuts both ways."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Bunet] 
Here. Look."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jade] 
Wow. This food looks amazing. Why did you 
prepare all of this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Bunet] 
I anticipated that you might come thank me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Bunet] 
In preparation, I went ahead and made this 
modest feast for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Jade] 
Thank you, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jade] 
Is this our dynamic now? Thanking each other 
back and forth through polite gestures?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Bunet] 
Strong friendships have been built on less."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jade] 
I suppose it does offer a reliable framework... 
with defined boundaries."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Bunet] 
Agreed. Now that that's settled, I'll just..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Jade] 
Touch my armor and you're a dead man."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Bunet] 
Heh. Fair enough."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Bunet] 
Good news, Jade. I am going to treat you to 
that stuffed crab stew we discussed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Jade] 
I don't recall any such discussion."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Bunet] 
""Jade's Repose."" That would be a good name 
for it, don't you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Jade] 
Oh. Right. I remember now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jade] 
You kept talking at me while I meditated inside 
my armor. Then you compared me to seafood."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Jade] 
It involved something like...cramming different 
ingredients into crab shells."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Bunet] 
Yes, yes. Anyway, that armor of yours... 
May I have a lick?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Jade] 
This conversation is over."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Bunet] 
Your armor may prove to be an interesting 
substitute for a crab shell. So much room..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Bunet] 
At what heat does one stew metal, I wonder?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jade] 
You're not getting anywhere near my armor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Jade] 
You're also...very obviously not listening to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Bunet] 
Come again? Oh, yes. Sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jade] 
I will admit, this chat is making me very hungry. 
Are you going to cook that stew or not?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Bunet] 
Yes, of course. Nothing is finer than sharing a 
meal with a friend."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Jade] 
Yes, as long as that's all this arrangement is─a 
friend sampling the cooking of another friend."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Bunet] 
Good. Then I will get cooking."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Bunet] 
But first, just a quick taste of that armor..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Jade] 
No!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Jade] 兜あり 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Jade] 兜あり 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Bunet] 
Jade? What are you doing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Jade] 兜あり 
Practicing mindfulness."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Bunet] 
Ah... I heard a rumor that you deal with stress 
by meditating in your armor. Seems it was true."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Jade] 兜あり 
Did you need help with something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Bunet] 
It's just that you look so appetizing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Jade] 兜あり 
Excuse me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Bunet] 
Your armor-clad stillness─it calls to mind one 
of my favorite dishes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Bunet] 
You take a crabshell, stuff it with vegetables, 
meats, and rice, and stew it for three days."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Bunet] 
Oh... I'm getting hungry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jade] 兜あり 
You're making it difficult to meditate, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Bunet] 
Aw, I can almost taste them..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Bunet] 
Those hearty bites of sumptuous stuffed crab..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Jade] 兜あり 
Please go away, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Bunet] 
Oh, was I bothering you? Farewell, then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Bunet] 
[Jade] 兜あり 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Jade] 兜あり 
Now I'm getting hungry."
