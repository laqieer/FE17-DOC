[Boucheron] 
Time for my afternoon tea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Lapis] 
Hey, Boucheron. I made a ton of snacks. Here. 
I bet it'll go great with your tea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Well, that was nice of you. Hang on, though. 
What is that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
A snack."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Boucheron] 
This is your snack? A weed?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Lapis] 
Yeah!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lapis] 
I pulled weeds earlier and then cooked them up 
to give as treats. Doesn't everyone do that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lapis] 
Oh, come on. This isn't a universal thing either?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Boucheron] 
Afraid not."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lapis] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Boucheron] 
Lapis, be honest with me. Are you from a 
poor village?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Lapis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lapis] 
Wh-what makes you say that?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Boucheron] 
It was getting increasingly obvious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lapis] 
Oh no, no, no, no! That's no good! I don't want 
anyone to know. Especially not...him."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Boucheron] 
""Him""?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lapis] 
Gah! Forget I said anything! Please, just don't 
tell anyone about this!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Boucheron] 
It's OK, Lapis. I'm not making fun of you or 
anyone else who came from poverty."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Boucheron] 
If anything, I'm inspired by the creativity it 
instilled in you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lapis] 
Now you're just lying to make me feel better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Boucheron] 
No, really. I've tried the watered-down milk 
and the ""fill up on smells"" trick for myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Lapis] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lapis] 
And...what did you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Boucheron] 
They weren't bad. I feel like I got a window into 
a whole different world."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Lapis] 
Really?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Boucheron] 
Really! So I'd love to try your snacks."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Boucheron] 
Wow, this flavor is unbelievable!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Boucheron] 
My life is now divided into the time before I'd 
tried this and the glorious time after."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Lapis] 
You know what, Boucheron?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Lapis] 
You're a good guy. I mean that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Boucheron] 
Aww, you're too kind. I'm just a guy who's all 
brawn and no brains."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Lapis] 
If you're really interested, I could teach you 
some more customs from my village."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Boucheron] 
I'd love that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Boucheron] 
Hang on, though. Before that, we have to share 
your snack with the others."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Boucheron] 
Hey, everyone! We've got a special treat today! 
Line up for snack time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Lapis] 
Haha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038,"[Lapis] 
Thanks, Boucheron. That means a lot to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Lapis] 2 
[Lapis] 
Looks like it's the two of us on serving duty 
again today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Looks like it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Ooo! We get steak today!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lapis] 
Mmm! It looks so delicious!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lapis] 
Gather around, everyone! Bring your rice and 
line up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Boucheron] 
Wait, why are you calling everyone? We serve 
people one at a time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Lapis] 
Huh? But we have to fill up on the smell first."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Boucheron] 
Fill up on what? What are you talking about?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lapis] 
The steak's smell, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Lapis] 
You've got to eat your rice while you can smell 
the steak grilling. That's how you get full."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Boucheron] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lapis] 
Come on, Boucheron. You're a grown-up. 
You should know all this by now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Boucheron] 
Is this some Brodian custom?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Lapis] 
No? This is how people eat all over the world."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Says who?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lapis] 
My family back home. And everyone else in 
the village, for that matter."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Boucheron] 
Lapis, I don't think anyone else does that. 
Not anywhere in the world."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Lapis] 
Haha, nuh-uh! You're not fooling me again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Boucheron] 
No, I'm not joking. I mean it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Lapis] 
Um, really?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Lapis] 
You're not just teasing me? Because that...that 
would be really rude."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Boucheron] 
Once again, I'm completely serious."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Lapis] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Lapis] 
You're right! Ha, silly me. I guess I got a little 
mixed up again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Boucheron] 
Hmm. Whereas for me, certain things are 
becoming clearer..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Lapis] 2 
[Lapis] 
You're...Boucheron, right? I'm Lapis. I'll be on 
serving duty starting today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
That's right, I'm Boucheron. I'll be serving with 
you, looks like. Nice to meet you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Let's get this done quick. I think everyone's 
pretty hungry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Here we go. That should be enough milk."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lapis] 
Enough?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lapis] 
That's way too much."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Boucheron] 
You think so? It seems about right to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Lapis] 
Then you need to get your eyes checked."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lapis] 
That's enough milk to last 10 days."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Boucheron] 
What are you talking about? It won't last the 
length of this meal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Lapis] 
What are you talking about? Look. Pour one 
part milk into the cup..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lapis] 
Then add ten parts water."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Boucheron] 
Hold on a second! Why would you add water? 
And why so much?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lapis] 
You don't dilute your milk? I always heard it 
was unhealthy to drink straight."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Boucheron] 
That's the first I've heard of it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lapis] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Lapis] 
You're not messing with me, right? You're 
being serious?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Boucheron] 
Completely serious."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Lapis] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Lapis] 
In that case...forget I said anything. I must have 
been confused."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Boucheron] 
I'm a little confused myself..."
