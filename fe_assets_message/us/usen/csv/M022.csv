MID_ED1_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Veyle] 3 

[Alear] 
That's it. I've summoned the Emblems, and 
we've fended off our enemies."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Veyle] 
What a relief."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alfred] 2 
[Alfred] 
I think I'd better apologize. To both of you."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Alear] 
What for?"
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alfred] 
Doubting what you said."
MID_ED1_#006,"I thought this was all one of Sombron's tricks─ 
a way to turn us against each other."
MID_ED1_#007,"But when we fought together, I knew it was 
you. Our ally. Our friend."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
Corrupted or not, I am glad you returned."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Alear] 
Thank you all for placing your trust in me."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alfred] 

[Timerra] 2 

[Timerra] 
And thanks to Lady Veyle! We couldn't have 
won without you."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Ivy] 
[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
Yes. Wresting back control of yourself, reviving 
the Divine Dragon... You did much today."
MID_ED1_#012,"If not for your efforts, we'd probably be dead."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Veyle] 
Thank you. I did what I could."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Diamant] 

[Alear] 

[Veyle] 
[Veyle] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Now we're all together again..."
MID_ED1_#015,...
MID_ED1_#016,"[Veyle] 
What's the matter?"
MID_ED1_#017,"[Alear] 
I can't move..."
MID_ED1_#018,"[Veyle] 
What? No..."
MID_ED1_#019,"[Alear] 
I'm vanishing."
MID_ED1_#020,"[Veyle] 
I knew this was a risk, but it wasn't supposed 
to happen so soon."
MID_ED1_#021,"I gave you all the power I could. It should have 
been enough."
MID_ED1_#022,"Unless... Oh no. Summoning the Emblems must 
have drained you."
MID_ED1_#023,"[Alear] 
I didn't realize."
MID_ED1_#024,"[Veyle] 
It's all right. I'll try again. Hang on!"
MID_ED1_#025,"Guardians of the underworld, cast aside the 
rules that govern life and death..."
MID_ED1_#026,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_ED1_#027,"[Veyle] 
Your body is rejecting my power! It can't 
take anymore..."
MID_ED1_#028,"[Alear] 
Thank you for trying, Veyle. But it seems my 
time has come."
MID_ED1_#029,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_ED1_#030,"[Alear] 
It's all right. The 12 Emblems are here."
MID_ED1_#031,"With their help, I know you'll be able to 
stop Sombron."
MID_ED1_#032,"[Veyle] 
No! You can't leave! You said we'd save the 
world together!"
MID_ED1_#033,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry. You'll have to do that without me."
MID_ED1_#034,"At least I was useful in the end. I can die 
knowing you're all safe."
MID_ED1_#035,"If only I could fight to the end with you, 
my friends..."
MID_ED1_#036,"[Veyle] 
Brother!"
MID_ED1_#036_F,"[Veyle] 
Sister!"
MID_ED1_#037,"[Alear] 
We got the rings back. We're all together."
MID_ED1_#038,"I wish I could have finished the mission Mother 
gave me..."
MID_ED1_#039,"I wish I could see the world come to peace. 
But all I see is..."
MID_ED1_#040,"[Alear] 
Light?"
MID_ED1_#041,"[Veyle] 

不明 1 
不明 
Dragon child. You desire the power to fight... 
to the end, alongside everyone."
MID_ED1_#042,"[Alear] 
Marth?"
MID_ED2_#001,"[Alear] 2 
[Veyle] 1 
[Alfred] 3 
[Alfred] 
The 12 Emblems must have granted 
their power..."
MID_ED2_#002,"[Veyle] 
Beautiful..."
MID_ED2_#003,"[Veyle] 
[Alfred] 

[Alear] 
How did this..."
MID_ED2_#004,"[Lumera] 1 

[Lumera] 
Before your slumber, I made you a promise."
MID_ED2_#005,"I said I'd give you a birthday present that suited 
you perfectly."
MID_ED2_#006,I always knew this day would come.
MID_ED2_#007,"A very happy birthday to you, ."
MID_ED2_#008,"[Lumera] 

[Alear] 
So, this ring..."
MID_ED2_#009,"[Marth] 1 
[Marth] 
That has become your Emblem Ring, 
."
MID_ED2_#010,"[Alear] 
Marth!"
MID_ED2_#011,"[Marth] 
Lumera's power was held in that ring. You have 
restored the power of the Divine Dragon."
MID_ED2_#012,"She must have known this day would come─ 
the day of your rebirth."
MID_ED2_#013,"[Alear] 
I was dead... And now, look at me, I feel...new. 
What do you mean, ""Emblem Ring""?"
MID_ED2_#014,"[Marth] 
Your life was saved by the combined power of 
12 rings, making you the thirteenth Emblem."
MID_ED2_#015,The Fire Emblem.
MID_ED2_#016,"[Alear] 
I'm the thirteenth Emblem? The Fire Emblem?"
MID_ED2_#017,"[Marth] 
[Celica] 1 
[Celica] 
That's right, ."
MID_ED2_#018,"And that is your Emblem Ring, much like the 
rings that house our spirits."
MID_ED2_#019,"[Celica] 
[Sigurd] 1 

[Sigurd] 
We Emblems have only ever been spirits. 
But you had a physical form..."
MID_ED2_#020,"Perhaps this is now why you seem unique 
among us."
MID_ED2_#021,"[Alear] 
And it's like I was never Corrupted!"
MID_ED2_#022,"[Sigurd] 
[Leif] 1 
[Leif] 
Your power as an Emblem dwells in the ring, 
just as dragons imbue their power into stones."
MID_ED2_#023,"Though you died, you are now reborn as an 
Emblem with a new body."
MID_ED2_#024,"[Alear] 
But...how?"
MID_ED2_#025,"Sombron used your power. I thought you could 
only grant it once every thousand years."
MID_ED2_#026,"[Leif] 

[Roy] 1 
[Roy] 
The 12 rings have another power. One we 
kept secret."
MID_ED2_#027,"[Alear] 
And what's that?"
MID_ED2_#028,"[Roy] 

[Lyn] 1 
[Lyn] 
Now that you're an Emblem, we can finally 
reveal the truth."
MID_ED2_#029,"[Lyn] 

[Eirika] 1 

[Eirika] 
We have always been able to perform the 
miracle at any time."
MID_ED2_#030,"[Eirika] 
[Ike] 1 
[Ike] 
To use it, we all had to be together and agree 
on who deserved the miracle."
MID_ED2_#031,"[Alear] 
So that means, I..."
MID_ED2_#032,"[Ike] 
[Micaiah] 1 
[Micaiah] 
Yes. We all agreed we wished to fight alongside 
you, ."
MID_ED2_#033,"[Micaiah] 
[Byleth] 1 
[Byleth] 
We could do this once and never again. Not in 
all the thousands of years ahead."
MID_ED2_#034,"[Byleth] 
[Lucina] 1 
[Lucina] 
What's more, this will be the last gift that we 
will ever give this world."
MID_ED2_#035,"[Lucina] 
[Corrin] 1 
[Corrin] 
This took all of our future power. It was worth it 
to fight alongside you now."
MID_ED2_#036,"[Corrin] 
[Marth] 1 
[Marth] 
This is the first time we Emblems have shared 
the same wish─for this, for you."
MID_ED2_#037,"[Alear] 
Everyone, you..."
MID_ED2_#038,"[Marth] 
This was the only way we could save you. 
No one returns from death."
MID_ED2_#039,"Now, being an Emblem is perhaps not what you 
desired. I hope we have done the right thing."
MID_ED2_#040,"[Alear] 
I've died twice. I didn't expect to be back again. 
So, thank you!"
MID_ED2_#041,"My friends and I will do our best to protect this 
world. I'll make the most of what you've done."
MID_ED2_#042,"Oh, and Marth..."
MID_ED2_#043,I'm so glad to see you again.
MID_ED2_#044,"I'm sorry we were separated in Elusia. It's been 
so long since then..."
MID_ED2_#045,"[Marth] 
Oh, it was barely a blink, compared to your 
years of slumber."
MID_ED2_#046,"It's good to see you, my fellow Emblem."
MID_ED2_#047,"[Alear] 
Ha! Yes, my fellow Emblem."
MID_ED2_#048,"[Marth] 
[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
Glad to have you back, Divine One."
MID_ED2_#049,"[Timerra] 3 

[Timerra] 
Don't even think about dying again! You 
hear me?"
MID_ED2_#050,"[Alfred] 

[Vander] 1 

[Vander] 
I don't think I could survive losing you 
a third time."
MID_ED2_#051,"[Timerra] 
[Ivy] 3 

[Ivy] 
How I prayed at the end...to be with you again. 
We all were, and now, here we are."
MID_ED2_#052,"[Vander] 
[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
And you're an Emblem. I look forward to seeing 
what you can do."
MID_ED2_#053,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry I worried you all."
MID_ED2_#054,"I'm not going anywhere ever again. I am with 
you now, all the way to the end."
MID_ED2_#055,"[Diamant] 

[Ivy] 
[Veyle] 1 

[Veyle] 
Now we'll always be together!"
MID_ED2_#056,"[Alear] 
Veyle, without you, I wouldn't be here."
MID_ED2_#057,Thank you.
MID_ED2_#058,"[Veyle] 
No... You saved my life, too, remember?"
MID_ED2_#059,I should be thanking you.
MID_ED2_#060,"[Alear] 
What is this? An earthquake?!"
MID_ED2_#061,"[Marth] 3 
[Marth] 
No. This is something far different. A greater 
force is in motion."
MID_ED2_#062,Something is happening in Gradlon.
MID_ED2_#063,"[Veyle] 
Let's look."
MID_ED3_#001,"[Alear] 2 
[Marth] 4 
[Veyle] 1 

[Alear] 
What in the world? What's all that in the 
middle of the sea?"
MID_ED3_#002,"[Veyle] 
Gradlon... It's back..."
MID_ED3_#003,"[Marth] 
A portal is opening in the sky. Soon, Sombron 
will set out to invade other worlds."
MID_ED3_#004,"[Alear] 
We have to stop him."
MID_ED3_#005,"[Marth] 
I wish we could, but there's a barrier in the way."
MID_ED3_#006,"[Veyle] 
Yes, and it's covering the entire continent. 
The power that must have taken..."
MID_ED3_#007,"Papa doesn't want us to interfere with 
his plans."
MID_ED3_#008,"[Alear] 
How do we break through?"
MID_ED3_#009,"[Marth] 
We will need to destroy the Fell Dragon Shards 
that are sustaining the barrier."
MID_ED3_#010,But I don't know where to find them.
MID_ED3_#011,"[Veyle] 
I can help."
MID_ED3_#012,"[Alear] 
You can?"
MID_ED3_#013,"[Veyle] 
I feel...I guess you'd call it a vortex of Fell 
Dragon power building up in Gradlon."
MID_ED3_#014,"I think there are two of them... No. Three. 
Follow me."
MID_ED3_#015,"[Alear] 
We'll destroy the Fell Dragon Shards and 
shatter the barrier. To Gradlon!"
MID_EV1_#001,"[Veyle] t 
[Veyle] 
Angry 

[Veyle] 
Look. The Emblem Rings have been scattered 
on the ground."
MID_EV1_#002,"Please, brother. Get close to a ring and try 
summoning an Emblem!"
MID_EV1_#002_F,"Please, sister. Get close to a ring and try 
summoning an Emblem!"
MID_EV2_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
We've found them."
MID_EV2_#002,"Teach us, Emblem of the Academy. Reignite us, 
Emblem of Awakening."
MID_EV2_#003,"Sweep across, Emblem of Blazing!"
MID_EV3_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
Here they are."
MID_EV3_#002,"Care for us, Emblem of Echoes. Heal us, 
Emblem of Dawn."
MID_EV4_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
Here we go..."
MID_EV4_#002,"Fight on, Emblem of Radiance. Provide for us, 
Emblem of the Holy War."
MID_EV4_#003,"Restore calm, Emblem of the Sacred."
MID_EV5_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
Now, please show yourself."
MID_EV5_#002,"Rise up, Emblem of Binding. Free us, Emblem 
of Genealogy."
MID_EV5_#003,"Bare your fangs, Emblem of Fates!"
MID_EV6_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Smile 

[Alear] 
That's all of the rings!"
MID_MOVIE1_#001,[Alear]
MID_MOVIE1_#002,"[Sombron] 
Ugh... I am your father. How dare you turn 
your sword on me!"
MID_MOVIE1_#003,You mean to strike me down?
MID_MOVIE1_#003_2,"Go on, do it!"
MID_MOVIE1_#004,"[Lumera] 
Why are you here all by yourself?!"
MID_MOVIE1_#005,"[Alear] 
The war is finally over, Mother. We don't have 
to worry any─"
MID_MOVIE1_#006,Ah!
MID_MOVIE1_#007,"[Sombron] 
Die, treacherous whelp..."
MID_MOVIE1_#008,"[Lumera] 
No..."
MID_MOVIE1_#009,"[Alear] 
I guess Fell Dragons have to die in the end... 
But I wanted to be...a good dragon."
MID_MOVIE1_#010,"[Lumera] 
And you will! Someday life will return to you."
MID_MOVIE1_#010_2,"[Lumera] 
And when that beautiful day...should dawn..."
MID_MOVIE1_#011,I will give you a birthday gift that suits you perfectly.
MID_MOVIE1_#012,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Mother..."
MID_MOVIE1_#013,If I see that day...
MID_MOVIE1_#014,"maybe I'll return...dressed in white...a gleaming 
sword at my side..."
MID_MOVIE1_#015,"A Divine Dragon, like you... Ready to save the world."
MID_MOVIE_#001,"Dragon child, you who fought bravely, even after death..."
MID_MOVIE_#002,Would you rise once more?
MID_MOVIE_#003,I want to fight. It can't end here.
MID_MOVIE_#004,"No matter how hard it may be, I have to 
continue until the world is safe."
MID_MOVIE_#005,I must fight...like the Emblems have!
MID_MOVIE_#006,"I have heard your wish. And thus, our power is yours."
MID_OP1_#001,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
..."
MID_OP1_#002,Not a nightmare... It was a memory...
MID_OP1_#003,Where am I?
MID_OP1_#004,Oh... I must have died protecting Veyle.
MID_OP1_#005,There's no waking up again this time.
MID_OP1_#006,"I had dreamed I would awaken as a hero... Only 
now I realize, that did happen. But it's too late."
MID_OP1_#007,I wonder if I'll be able to find Mother here.

MID_OP1_#011,"[Alear] 
Veyle? Why are you here?"
MID_OP1_#012,"[Veyle] 
Papa used the rings to raise Gradlon."
MID_OP1_#013,"The helmet reactivated, my head began to 
swim, and then...I was here."
MID_OP1_#014,"Things didn't go how I wanted them to. And 
now it seems I've died."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Veyle] 
Papa said you're my big brother."
MID_OP1_#016_F,"[Veyle] 
Papa said you're my big sister."
MID_OP1_#017,"You gave your life to protect me. I'm so sorry. 
You should have let me die."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Alear] 
Don't say that! I made the right choice."
MID_OP1_#019,"You have a link back home. There's still a 
chance for you."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Veyle] 
No... No more."
MID_OP1_#021,"[Alear] 
What?"
MID_OP1_#022,"[Veyle] 
I tried so hard. I wanted Papa to look at me 
and not see a defect."
MID_OP1_#023,"I wanted him to forget about the other worlds 
and just be with me."
MID_OP1_#024,"I'd always think, ""If only I tried harder..."""
MID_OP1_#025,"But it never mattered! I kept getting crushed 
over and over..."
MID_OP1_#026,"I'm so tired. If I have to die again and fail 
once more..."
MID_OP1_#027,I'd rather it just end here─with you.
MID_OP1_#028,"[Alear] 
Oh, Veyle..."
MID_OP1_#029,"[Veyle] 
Hey. Why don't we fall asleep...together? 
The world will end with or without us."
MID_OP1_#030,"And...I feel happy because I finally found you. 
Maybe the others will join us eventually."
MID_OP1_#031,"[Alear] 
Perhaps you're right."
MID_OP1_#032,"[Veyle] 
Well, then..."
MID_OP1_#033,"[Alear] 
Except...I'm not ready to give up. I want to save 
our world and everyone I care about."
MID_OP1_#034,"Veyle, you have been through so much, and 
I understand why you feel the way you do."
MID_OP1_#035,"But please, don't give up. Not before you 
experience the life you deserve."
MID_OP1_#036,"[Veyle] 
I don't care anymore. Even if I returned and 
survived all of it..."
MID_OP1_#037,"I can't stop Papa because I can't 
summon Emblems."
MID_OP1_#038,"All I can do is create the Corrupted. A foul 
ability befitting a Fell Dragon."
MID_OP1_#039,"[Alear] 
Corrupted..."
MID_OP1_#040,"Veyle, there is something you can do."
MID_OP1_#041,"[Veyle] 
Huh?"
MID_OP1_#042,"[Alear] 
Revive me as one of the Corrupted."
MID_OP1_#043,"[Veyle] 
What?!"
MID_OP1_#044,"[Alear] 
You did it to King Hyacinth. It was as if he'd 
come back to life─returned to himself."
MID_OP1_#045,"Perhaps I could go back to the living world in 
the same way."
MID_OP1_#046,"[Veyle] 
Maybe, but you aren't thinking this through!"
MID_OP1_#047,You hate the Corrupted. They terrify you!
MID_OP1_#048,"Now you want to be one? If we do that, you'll 
never be able to change back!"
MID_OP1_#049,"This way, at least you died as yourself. Would 
you really want to die as one of them?"
MID_OP1_#050,"[Alear] 
I'll sacrifice more than that if it saves everyone."
MID_OP1_#051,"How I die doesn't matter. I just want to end 
this war. However I can."
MID_OP1_#052,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_OP1_#053,"[Alear] 
Please don't give up, Veyle. If we don't try, 
we lose everything."
MID_OP1_#054,"To me, this is the only way forward."
MID_OP1_#055,"[Veyle] 
But..."
MID_OP1_#056,"[Alear] 
Veyle... What do you live for?"
MID_OP1_#057,"[Veyle] 
What do you mean?"
MID_OP1_#058,"[Alear] 
My friends told me it doesn't matter where 
you're from. What's important is how you live."
MID_OP1_#059,"How you live and what you do shapes your 
future. So...who do you want to become?"
MID_OP1_#060,"[Veyle] 
I've never thought about that."
MID_OP1_#061,"But if it were possible for me to change now, 
I suppose..."
MID_OP1_#062,"I'd want to be like you. I'd want to become a 
dragon who saves the world."
MID_OP1_#063,"[Alear] 
We really are siblings."
MID_OP1_#064,"[Veyle] 
Hm?"
MID_OP1_#065,"[Alear] 
I said something very similar a long time ago."
MID_OP1_#066,Let's go back and save our world. Together.
MID_OP1_#067,"[Veyle] 
All right."
MID_OP1_#068,"I'll give it one last try. I hope to see you 
soon, brother."
MID_OP1_#068_F,"I'll give it one last try. I hope to see you 
soon, sister."

You're my dear sister, and I trust you with all of 
my heart."

Aww, you miss her, Mauvier? Then I'll kill 
you first."

other side."
