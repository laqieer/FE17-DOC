[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
Lady Veyle! You look like someone who could 
stand to run some laps!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
Hehe, why do you say that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alfred] 
Because you've got that look on your face. The 
one that says, ""Things are unbelievably terrible."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alfred] 
Listen, some problems you just can't solve, 
no matter how hard you wish you could."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alfred] 
For those, you gotta get out there and run until 
all you remember is the run."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
I don't know..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Veyle] 
How can I just forget?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Veyle] 
The terrible things I did... The pain I caused..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Veyle] 
My heart is so full of guilt, and I'm afraid I'm 
going to feel like this forever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alfred] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alfred] 
You know what? This sounds too tough to leave 
behind, even with the help of a good run."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Veyle] 
Yes...I think you're right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alfred] 
So, every mile or two, try a few sets of 
push-ups. That oughta do the trick."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Veyle] 
Um..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alfred] 
And if you add some crunches, you'll be golden! 
I guarantee you a good night's sleep after that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Veyle] 
Crunches?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Veyle] 
Hehe!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Veyle] 
Oh, Alfred. I don't think my problems can be 
solved by push-ups...or crunches."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alfred] 
Of course. You know that, and I know that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alfred] 
You probably won't ever forget all that stuff 
you told me about."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Veyle] 
No."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Veyle] 
I'll continue to shoulder this guilt and regret 
for a long time..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alfred] 
Maybe you will. But you've gotta give yourself 
a break sometimes, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alfred] 
If you don't set your troubles down every now 
and then, they'll crush you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Veyle] 
You're right, Alfred. Thank you so much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Veyle] 
You know, I think I might want to go for a run."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Veyle] 
Will you come with me? Please?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Alfred] 
Just say the word."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Alfred] 
I'd be happy to push you so hard, you can't 
think of anything else. It's what I do best!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Alfred, there's something I've been worried 
about."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
Hmm, well... How about we go for a 
run together?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Veyle] 
I don't understand. How will that help?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alfred] 
Haha, when the sweat starts to drip and your 
legs get sore, everything else melts away!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Veyle] 
So, I'm just supposed to...to forget about the 
stuff that's worrying me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alfred] 
Sure! As long as that stuff's not bothering you 
anymore, that's a good thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Veyle] 
Um, let me try again. I have worries that I 
actually want to solve, not just forget about."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alfred] 
Then tell me all about 'em."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Veyle] 
OK. Well, I want to find a way to be of help 
to people once the war is over."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Veyle] 
I don't know exactly what to do yet, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Veyle] 
I wondered if I could ask you for help figuring 
it out?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alfred] 
Of course! I'm happy to do whatever I can."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Veyle] 
Oh, thank you! I knew you were the right person 
to ask."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Veyle] 
But here's what worries me. Alfred, I did so 
many bad things...before."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Veyle] 
I don't think anyone, except maybe the people 
here, will accept my help."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alfred] 
Yeah, could be. Lotta people out there don't 
know the whole story with you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alfred] 
But that's OK. You can take all the time you 
need to get folks to understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alfred] 
I'll be there vouching for you every step of 
the way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alfred] 
It's the least I can do for a good buddy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Veyle] 
That's very kind of you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alfred] 
But I guess this doesn't go too far toward 
solving your problems, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alfred] 
Maybe there's something more I can do 
right now?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Veyle] 
No, it's OK. You've done so much for 
me already."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Veyle] 
Thank you, Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Ack..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alfred] 
Lady Veyle!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Veyle] 
Oh, Alfred..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alfred] 
You're drenched in sweat. Are you feeling OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Veyle] 
It's so, so spicy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alfred] 
What is?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Veyle] 
This soup I'm eating."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alfred] 
Wait...is that all?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
Haha! Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Veyle] 
What's so funny?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alfred] 
You just look so dead set on eating that soup, 
no matter how spicy it is."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
It's my favorite, but I can't help making 
a weird face every time I eat it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Veyle] 
I know. How about you give it a try?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Veyle] 
It's so spicy you'll make a weird face too. 
Just you wait and see!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alfred] 
Challenge accepted!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alfred] 
Eww..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alfred] 
Hmm?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alfred] 
AHH! HOT! Too hot! Need water NOW!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Veyle] 
Hehehe, see! Your face was way weirder than 
mine. I win!"
