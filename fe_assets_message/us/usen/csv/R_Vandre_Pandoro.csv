[Vander] 
Hngh! Come on, Vander. Mustn't let those 
young folk show you up..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Vander, what's going on? Is this a training 
technique you learned in Lythos?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Vander] 
No! It's nothing! Now...go away!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Oh... I was just checking in as a friend. Sorry to 
disturb you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Vander] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Vander] 
Pandreo, wait. I was trying to...learn how 
to dance."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, OK. You're learning how to dance."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Pandreo] 
Wait a minute. Learning how to dance?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Vander] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Pandreo] 
But I thought you had a bad back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Vander] 
Shut up, will you! I am trying to understand 
what the young people get out of it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Vander] 
But these motions are...beyond me. I feel young, 
but my body has no such delusions."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Ah, it's just that you're not used to it. Anyone 
can learn with a little practice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Vander] 
Hm. In that case, I suppose I'll keep at it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Hm-hm!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Pandreo] 
You're nothing if not steadfast. I admire that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Vander] 
Is that one of those ironic compliments you 
young people enjoy so much?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Pandreo] 
No, really! Though you and I are from different 
generations, we share beliefs as holy men."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Pandreo] 
I think learning from each other's experiences 
can only benefit us both."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Pandreo] 
Like with the stories you told at my party─ 
I really appreciated hearing them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Vander] 
I am always glad to impart what I have learned."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Vander] 
Let us continue teaching each other─for the 
church's future, and indeed, the world's."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Pandreo] 
Agreed!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Vander] 
To that end, I will master this dance so that 
I may ""boogie down"" at your next party. Hup!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Vander] 
URGH! MY BACK!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Pandreo] 
Oh! Sweet mother of─ How is it bent like that?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Thank you for coming to the party today, 
Sir Vander! You really elevated the proceedings."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Vander] 
Pandreo, did my ears deceive me, or were you 
and the other guests...howling?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, don't worry about that. Just a thing 
we do when the spirit moves us."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Pandreo] 
We were riveted by your fascinating stories 
about Queen Lumera."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Vander] 
Well, that's good, but... Really, what bizarre 
gathering did I witness?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Vander] 
You spoke of pious songs and dances. I was 
expecting something rather solemn."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Vander] 
Instead, it was a circus! Everyone hopping 
about and yelping like rabid dogs."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Vander] 
Could you even hear what I was saying over 
all the commotion?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Pandreo] 
Of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Pandreo] 
That was why we got so excited. We were 
celebrating your stories in our bodies and souls."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Vander] 
Hm, is that so. Call me old-fashioned but... 
I usually celebrate stories by listening to them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Pandreo] 
I did notice you didn't dance with us."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Vander] 
Of course not! This creaky back of mine would 
snap if I cavorted around like that!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Still, I appreciate your open-mindedness. In the 
early days, some followers would complain."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Vander] 
Did they now?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Pandreo] 
Yes. People in Solm don't tend toward religion. 
The church used to be rather, ah, ill-attended."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Then I had an idea that turned things around."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Vander] 
To make church more like a party."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Pandreo] 
Exactly! If you want people to listen, you have 
to speak in a language they understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Vander] 
You worked hard to rebuild your church. 
I apologize for calling it a circus."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Vander] 
Though...unorthodox, your methods have clearly 
brought in new worshippers. I appreciate that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Pandreo] 
That is high praise coming from you, Sir Vander."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Vander] 
Yes, well. Perhaps more flexible thinking is just 
what the world needs right now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Sir Vander, is it true you used to serve in Lythos 
under Queen Lumera?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Vander] 
Yes, I was her attendant. Why do you ask?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Pandreo] 
I just want to say that as a man of the cloth, 
I hold you in the highest regard."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Pandreo] 
I would have given my left arm for such an 
honorable station─in the Holy Land, no less."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Vander] 
Keep flattering me and you may lose an ear 
instead. I'll talk it off with my old war stories."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Pandreo] 
Please do! I'd love to hear about what it 
was like."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Vander] 
Certainly. Though perhaps we should find a 
more appropriate place to talk."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Pandreo] 
Why don't you come to my next party? 
That ought to be a suitable setting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Vander] 
Hm. I'm not usually one for parties."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, I'm sure you'll fit right in. It's just a small 
gathering at the church."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Pandreo] 
Young adherents praying for peace─some pious 
singing and dancing. That sort of thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Vander] 
Worship through song and dance? Why, that 
sounds marvelous."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Pandreo] 
I see it as my clerical duty to help people find 
comfort in these difficult times."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Vander] 
I understand. You put on these get-togethers as 
a kind of service to your congregants."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Exactly! So, would you care to join us?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Vander] 
Of course. How could I refuse an invitation to 
such a sanctified gathering?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Wonderful! I look forward to seeing you there."
