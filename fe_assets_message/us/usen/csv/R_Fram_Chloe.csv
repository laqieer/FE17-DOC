[Framme] 
OK, I'm back. And I brought fried eel."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Chloé] 
Nice. Ooh, they cut it into little bite-sized 
chunks too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
Time to give it the ol' taste test!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Framme] 
Go for it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Chloé] 
Mmm, these are good. There's a nice softness 
to the inside once you get past the outer crust."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Chloé] 
Hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Chloé] 
Oh."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Framme] 
What's up? Oh no, don't tell me..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Chloé] 
This isn't eel."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Framme] 
Aww! I'm so, so, so sorry!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Chloé] 
So, uh, what am I eating?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Framme] 
I just checked the receipt, and it's...fried bugs."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Chloé] 
Bugs?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Chloé] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Chloé] 
That's amazing! I had no idea bugs could be 
so delicious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Framme] 
Are you─ You're really OK with that?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Chloé] 
Hm? Well, sure! It's gonna be tough to stop 
myself from eating all of them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Framme] 
Wow. I thought for sure you'd be mad."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Chloé] 
What's to be mad about? Thanks to you, I've 
got a new kind of folk food to look out for."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Chloé] 
If I'd sent anyone else, I'd just be eating the 
same old fried eel again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Chloé] 
I should keep you in mind for the next time I'm 
too busy to hit up a new food stall too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Framme] 
I'd love that! Anything to be helpful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Framme] 
So, can I take your order for the next time?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Chloé] 
Hmm, what am I in the mood for?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Chloé] 
Wait, what am I saying? The whole point is to 
see what you manage to come up with."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Chloé] 
Finding out what you somehow bring me is half 
the fun. Who knows what I'll end up eating next!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Framme] 
Hahaha, thanks! Here's to more mystery meals!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Chloé] 2 
[Framme] 
One snake sandwich, as requested! 
Here you go."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
Thanks! I'm gonna try it right now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Chloé] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Chloé] 
What a sandwich! The fluffy bread lulls you in, 
and then crunch! The roasted snake hits you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Chloé] 
It's a flavor cascade from the first bite. Twelve 
out of ten."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Framme] 
Yay! I'm so glad you like it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Chloé] 
What the?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Chloé] 
There's something slightly off about this..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Framme] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Chloé] 
Are you sure this is a snake sandwich?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Framme] 
Sure, I'm sure. Look, you can see the roast 
snake right there, yeah?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Chloé] 
No. It's close, but it's not snake."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Chloé] 
I think it's actually...eel?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Framme] 
Ah! I think you're right..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Framme] 
I'm so sorry! I remember now... The snake 
sandwich stall was next to the eel stall."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Chloé] 
Oh, so you went to the wrong one? 
Aw, Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Framme] 
This is just the kind of screwup I keep making 
as Steward of the Dragon too. I'm real sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Chloé] 
Don't worry about it. Even if it's eel and not 
snake, my rating stands."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Chloé] 
Here, try for yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Framme] 
OK. Here goes..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Framme] 
What the heck? Has eel always been this good?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Chloé] 
That's what I'm saying. It's like I'm tasting it for 
the first time. The true appeal of eel."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Chloé] 
Oh, that reminds me. I heard about another new 
food stall opening up soon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Chloé] 
If you don't mind, could I ask you to go buy me 
some more eel dishes?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Framme] 
I'm on it! And this time, I'll definitely get your 
order right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Chloé] 2 
[Chloé] 
This mission is taking so much longer than 
I thought."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Chloé] 
By the time I'm done, it'll be too late."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Framme] 
What's the rush, Chloé? Ooh, do you have a hot 
date tonight?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Chloé] 
Nope. There's this folk-food stall I was hoping 
to visit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Framme] 
A folk-food stall?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Chloé] 
Yeah. I have a thing for local foods made with 
unusual ingredients."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Chloé] 
But the shops that sold them were already rare, 
and the war has made them almost nonexistent."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Chloé] 
I'd heard there was a food stall opening today, 
so I was hoping to check it out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Framme] 
If it's that important to you, I can go in your 
place. I'll be your personal shopper!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Chloé] 
You'd do that for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Framme] 
Sure! I'm not so busy that I can't make a slight 
detour on the errands I was running anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Chloé] 
Whoa, thanks! I think I'll take you up on that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Framme] 
So, what can I get for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Chloé] 
It's roasted snake meat between two buns. 
They call it a snake sandwich!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Framme] 
Wh─ Why would anyone..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Chloé] 
Folk food is always tied to local traditions."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Chloé] 
Eating it is like taking a bite of history. That's 
what makes it so great."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Framme] 
Oh... Huh. I think that makes sense...from a 
certain point of view."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Framme] 
Anyway, I'll be back in two shakes with your 
sandwich of snakes!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Chloé] 
Here's some money. Buy one for yourself, too, 
so we can eat them together!"
