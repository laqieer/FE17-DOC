MID_RELIANCE_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Zelkov! It is now time..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
for me to stop challenging you. It does not 
matter anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
You seem less than *pleased* about it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
I know that you...dislike me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Zelkov] 
*Dislike* you? What makes you say so?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
Come on. It is clear you and Princess Ivy both 
care little for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
It makes me sad. I...wanted to be friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Zelkov] 
*Friends*? Ugh, you are a fool."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Zelkov] 
I had meant to wait until Princess Ivy was 
present to *reveal* this, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Zelkov] 
*Here* is what I have been painting."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
What is this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Zelkov] 
My *completed* work. The three of us─you, 
Princess Ivy, and myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
You...included me. Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Zelkov] 
Princess Ivy intended this as a gift for you. 
To *celebrate.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
Celebrate what?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Zelkov] 
The day she and I *met* you. 
Have you forgotten?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Zelkov] 
Today is the anniversary of that day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
Oh."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Zelkov] 
You came to Elusia Castle in search of 
challenging *duels.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Zelkov] 
Your search for stronger *opponents* led you 
all the way from your homeland to us."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
I defeated every foe the castle could muster 
for me...until you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
That was my first ever defeat. I was crushed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Zelkov] 
But King Hyacinth was *delighted* by your 
skill. He pressed you into Princess Ivy's service."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Kagetsu] 
You and Princess Ivy had such looks on 
your faces."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Kagetsu] 
You were both so displeased and so angry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Zelkov] 
You had just cut your way through every castle 
*guard* for reasons we could only guess at."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes, it must have looked bad to you. I am sorry 
for that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Zelkov] 
I was indeed rather angry at the time, but 
all is *forgiven* now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Zelkov] 
Princess Ivy has forgiven you as well. That is 
why she now *celebrates* the day we met."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Zelkov] 
You are important to her."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Kagetsu] 
Zelkov... Thank you..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Zelkov] 
Are you...*crying*?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Zelkov] 
No matter. I was about to go find Princess Ivy. 
Perhaps you would *accompany* me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Kagetsu] 
I will wait here. I don't want her to see me 
this way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Zelkov] 
Do not *concern* yourself about that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Zelkov] 
Princess Ivy might actually *approve* of seeing 
this side of you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Kagetsu] 
Do you think so? Are you both so truly 
accepting of me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038,"[Zelkov] 
Come, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#039,"[Kagetsu] 
My heart bursts with love for you and Princess 
Ivy! My exploded heart will love you forever!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Zelkov! Our time is at hand. Prepare yourself!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Zelkov] 
Again, I am *afraid* I must decline."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
Ugh! I tire of hearing that! It is not your right 
to deny me this way!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Face me in mock battle now, or...I will fight 
your artwork in your place."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Zelkov] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
You always have time for some trivial 
obsession! Never for your friend!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
How are we supposed to bond?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Zelkov] 
Calm yourself. I hear your *concerns,* but 
destroying my art will not make this better."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Zelkov] 
It would only *ensure* I not speak to you again. 
Put down your weapon, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Zelkov] 
What about this is *amusing* to you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
This tense mood! Do you feel it? It is as if we 
are rivals, destined for conflict!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
At last, you are taking me seriously!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
If you will not face me as my friend, then 
at least you will do so as my opponent!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Zelkov] 
*Enough.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
What, standing down already? Does your art 
mean so little to you after all?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Zelkov] 
I have seen your eyes. You lack the conviction 
of a killer. You are a *child* seeking attention."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Kagetsu] 
Child?! How dare you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Zelkov] 
Leave me. This is a *genuine* warning."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
I get no say in this at all, do I?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Zelkov] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Zelkov] 
Yes. This is *acceptable.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
Zelkov! Training bout! Now!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Zelkov] 
Yaah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Zelkov] 
Must you insist on *startling* me so?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
Did I catch you off-guard? Haha, come now. 
You are better than that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
Our work for Princess Ivy demands unflappable 
mettle! Your will must be steel!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
So, training bout! Face me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Zelkov] 
Apologies, but I am presently *preoccupied.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
What is it this time? Watching birds? 
Sculpting clay?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
Your smirk tells me it must be some silly 
new obsession."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Zelkov] 
I am painting. And I require *silence* to focus, 
if you would be so kind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
I knew it would be painting someday. Set it 
aside for now. Single combat awaits!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Zelkov] 
This pursuit is *important* to me. Please find 
another training partner."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
Is this art of yours more important to you than 
our friendship, Zelkov?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
You are my only colleague! It is important 
we spend time together."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Zelkov] 
Mm-hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
Too focused to respond. Ignoring me 
completely. Seems I am alone again."
