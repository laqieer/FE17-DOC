[Mauvier] 2 

[Alear] 
May I join you as you help the village today?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Pardon me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
It is inappropriate for the Divine Dragon to 
help with such menial tasks."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
I disagree."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Mauvier] 
You are a strange one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Mauvier] 
Why do you feel you must be so kind to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
Well, I realized something after spending time 
with you. We have quite a bit in common."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Mauvier] 
Impossible. You have never engaged in villainy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
We are, each of us, unable to resist offering a 
helping hand to those in need."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
Our only difference? You momentarily strayed 
from the path. But now you are home."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Mauvier] 
Are you making excuses for my actions?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
You can't forgive your past mistakes precisely 
because you're a good person."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
The only fault I can see in your character is that 
you don't believe you can be good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alear] 
You don't need to burden yourself with shame 
or seek atonement..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
All you need to do is trust your friends and 
stand by their side."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
Please trust me, Mauvier. I want nothing more 
than to help you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Mauvier] 
I have made so many mistakes that I have long 
told myself I am beyond redemption."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Mauvier] 
Yet, you make me question my way of thinking."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Mauvier] 
Perhaps the Divine Dragon understands who I 
am better than I do myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
Of course not."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Mauvier] 
I accept your offer of help in the village. That is, 
if you are still willing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alear] 
Let's get to it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Mauvier] 
What an odd sensation! My chest feels warm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alear] 
That's happiness. A feeling you deserve, and 
one you are about to give to others."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Mauvier] 
With the Divine Dragon by my side, anything 
is possible."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Mauvier] 
Thank you. I would never have found my way 
without you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 

[Alear] 
I've been thinking about how you said you are 
not a good person. I heartily disagree."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
For example, I've watched you go out of your 
way to help people in town."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Mauvier] 
My past actions serve as evidence that I am 
otherwise. I strive now only for penance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Mauvier] 
I once wished to live a humble life. I followed 
the Fell Dragon as I was taught."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Mauvier] 
That path led to my becoming the enemy of 
many. Most notably, you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
But those days are gone..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Mauvier] 
Anything I say will be a weak excuse for my 
part in my own downfall."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Mauvier] 
I failed to stop Lady Veyle or the rampage of 
the Four Hounds."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Mauvier] 
So long as I bear those sins, I am unworthy of 
redemption or forgiveness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Mauvier] 
My acts of kindness towards the people of this 
town are only a selfish attempt at atonement."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Mauvier] 
Any words of praise─from anyone, especially 
you─give me no pleasure. Only suffering."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
How long do you expect your penance to last?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Mauvier] 
I do not know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Mauvier] 
I do not think my work will be done, even 
after death."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Mauvier] 
I am guilty of too much to hope otherwise."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 

[Alear] 
Mauvier, I'm curious. What are some of your 
favorite things?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Pardon? Why would you wish to know?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
I've decided to give you a gift as a token of 
my gratitude."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Mauvier] 
A gift from the Divine Dragon?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Mauvier] 
For what reason? Perhaps you are mistaken 
about who I am."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alear] 
You are Veyle's knight, yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
Veyle is alive today because of your actions."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
She is my only sibling, and I cannot thank you 
enough for protecting her."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
Do you understand why I might want to reward 
you for such service?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Mauvier] 
I understand. However..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Mauvier] 
Knowing I have your gratitude is reward 
enough."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
Only my gratitude?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Mauvier] 
I am pleased you value my efforts to aid the 
Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Mauvier] 
I am not a ""good person."" As your former 
enemy, I am unworthy of your praise."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Mauvier] 
Pardon me. I am needed elsewhere."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Mauvier, you don't..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Thank you for your help today─aiding in the 
relief of these troubled people."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Guiding the lost, mediating conflicts... A lot has 
happened today."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Mauvier] 
Tiring work, but worth it to see people smile."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Mauvier] 
I've realized my charitable acts were always 
penance to alleviate my own pains. No more."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
I do see you smile more than you used to."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
It's a wonderful thing, seeing you heal."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Mauvier] 
I can trust myself─and others─unlike before. 
And it is trust that has helped me to find peace."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Mauvier] 
It is because of you that I have found this truth 
about myself."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
Oh?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Mauvier] 
Is my statement so odd?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
Not at all. I was just thinking how nice it is to 
hear that you are happy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
I have been considering something... No. 
Perhaps not."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Mauvier] 
Did you just hide something?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
No. Not at all. I've not hidden anything."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
Oh no..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Mauvier] 
Is this...the Pact Ring? Why would you risk 
having something so valuable here?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
I─ Um... I was..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Mauvier] 
Divine One...do you mean to... Will you give 
me this ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
Huh?! I..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
This ring marks a bond between myself and 
someone I consider very dear to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
Asking for this ring is saying you wish to be 
my partner..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
Is that what you want?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Mauvier] 
Indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Mauvier] 
You saved me, body and soul."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Mauvier] 
At first, I was thankful. Then the feeling grew. 
You became quite special to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Mauvier] 
When I saw the Pact Ring just now, I finally 
acknowledged those feelings."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Mauvier] 
I realized I should be the one beside you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Alear] 
Mauvier..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Mauvier] 
However, I fear I am not worthy of this ring. 
Not in this moment."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Mauvier] 
But...I will be someday. Will you consider 
my request?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033,"[Alear] 
You know...I've almost offered you this ring 
once or twice before."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035,"[Alear] 
You are brave, fierce, and loving. Your kind 
heart is why I'm drawn to you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#036,"[Alear] 
Still, I could never work up the courage. I'm so 
glad you asked."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#037,"[Alear] 
I wonder what Veyle would think of this?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#038,"[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle recently mentioned that she cares 
about us both and our happiness."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#039,"[Alear] 
Heh, did she? How very Veyle to see what 
neither of us would admit."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#040,"[Alear] 
Well then, it is time for me to muster my 
courage after all."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#041,"[Alear] 
Mauvier, please accept this ring and become 
my partner."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#042,"[Mauvier] 
I accept, and I am honored."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#043,"[Alear] 
I hope you will cherish this ring and our bond 
forever and always."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#044,"[Mauvier] 
I shall, Divine Dragon ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#045,"[Mauvier] 
I thought I would never feel happiness. Now I 
know nothing else. I will always be by your side."
