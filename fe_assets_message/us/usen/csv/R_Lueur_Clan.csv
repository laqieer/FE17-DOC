[Clanne] 2 

[Alear] 
Clanne, you're looking bright-eyed and 
bushy-tailed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Clanne] 
Yes, I'm feeling much better now that I've 
gotten some rest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
Good. Please, try not to overwork yourself 
going forward, all right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Clanne] 
Listen. It's like I said─we stewards waited a 
thousand years for you to wake up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Clanne] 
And you're as amazing as I imagined. No, even 
more so!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Clanne] 
But I... I failed you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Clanne] 
I'm supposed to make your life easier. Instead, 
I made you worry about me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Clanne] 
I'm really sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
""Sorry""? You're doing a great job, Clanne."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
It's really heartening to see how hard you work."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Clanne] 
It is?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
Yes. And not just that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alear] 
I know you've always been there to support me. 
Even since before I woke up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
I find it quite touching how deeply you care 
for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Clanne] 
Yes, well... Of course, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
Clanne? Are you crying?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Clanne] 
I'm just...really happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Clanne] 
The Divine Dragon thinks I did a good job."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Clanne] 
I'm going to keep on doing whatever I can to 
help you out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alear] 
I appreciate that. But please..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Clanne] 
I know, I know. I'll make sure not to push 
myself too hard."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alear] 
Haha, glad to hear it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Clanne] 2 

[Alear] 
Um, Clanne?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
Uh... Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
Psst. Clanne. Clanne!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Clanne] 
AH! My apologies, Divine One!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
Is everything OK? You were really out of it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Clanne] 
I'm fine. Got a little distracted, that's all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
OK... Listen. I think you might be wearing 
yourself out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Clanne] 
What? No, I'm not! I was just...uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Clanne] 
I'm...really not..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
Admit it. Your plate's too full with everything 
you do for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Clanne] 
What? No! Absolutely not! If anything, it's not 
full enough!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Clanne] 
Pile my plate with more of those tasty, tasty 
responsibilities! Anything for the Divine Dragon!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Clanne] 
Seriously, whatever you tell me to do, I'll do it. 
Go ahead! Give me an order!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
Well...if you insist..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
I order you to get some rest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Clanne] 
No fair! You cheated!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
Sorry. You're irreplaceable. I can't have you 
wearing yourself out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
You have to take some time off so that you're 
ready in case the worst happens."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Clanne] 
But... But..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alear] 
Rest, Clanne. That's an order."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Clanne] 
All right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Clanne] 
If you insist, I'll just...lie down for a bit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Clanne] 2 
[Clanne] 
Divine One, what are you doing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Oh, hello, Clanne."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
I was just tidying up a bit. Tomorrow's a busy 
day, so I thought I'd get it out of the way now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Clanne] 
Let me take care of that. You should get 
some rest!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
That's all right. I can handle it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Clanne] 
No, no. That won't do. I'm gonna have to insist."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
But..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Clanne] 
Please? You know, I waited a long time for you 
to wake up."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Clanne] 
And not just me. The stewards before me spent 
their whole lives waiting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Clanne] 
Now, after a thousand years, I get to serve you! 
It's like a miracle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Clanne] 
So...please, let me do it. Honestly, truly, I would 
be honored to help."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
Very well, you've convinced me. I'll leave it 
to you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Clanne] 
Thank you, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
I should be thanking you for taking such great 
care of me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alear] 
I'm very lucky to have you as a steward."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Clanne] 
You mean it?! Oh man. I'm so happy I could 
faint!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Haha, please don't. Now that I'm free from 
tidying up, I'm going to get some rest."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Clanne] 2 
[Clanne] 
Divine Dragon... Can I talk to you about... 
It's about something serious."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Of course, Clanne. What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Clanne] 
Ever since I was little, I wondered about the 
Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Clanne] 
I had so many ideas about who you were or 
what you might be like."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
Hah, so did I live up to what you imagined?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Clanne] 
I think... I think it would be better if I hadn't 
met you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Clanne] 
If I only ever saw you asleep, like all the 
stewards before me, I wouldn't feel so...so..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
Clanne?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Clanne] 
I know that, as a steward, I'm not supposed to 
be saying things like this. I know that..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Clanne] 
But... But I... I want..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Clanne] 
I want to be a great steward. Like I imagined 
I'd be─once you woke up, I mean."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Clanne] 
I want to be who you call when you need help. 
But that can't happen... I'm not that strong."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
Clanne, that's..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
I've always found you an excellent steward."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Clanne] 
I felt like I was, at first─when you were still 
asleep all the time. But now..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Clanne] 
All I do is think about how I should help you 
more than I do. Or than I can."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
Clanne..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
I agree with you. Completely and totally. You 
should be helping me more than you are."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Clanne] 
Oh... I...should?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
Indeed. And it's well past time we discussed 
this problem."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Clanne] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
As my steward, you have many duties. One of 
which is to be my right hand. But you're not."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Clanne] 
I-I'm not? But I try so hard, I mean... What do 
I mean? What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Alear] 
My steward cannot be all I need unless they 
are designated as my most important officer."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
Here. This is the Pact Ring. I have only the one, 
and you have earned it. Many times over."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
You understand what this is? Yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Clanne] 
Oh, h-hang on... I'm so happy I'm dizzy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Alear] 
Clanne, you're swaying. Have a seat, before you 
fall over. Please."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Clanne] 
The Pact Ring? For me? Ah, come on. You're 
just saying stuff to cheer me up."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033,"[Alear] 
The pact can only be formed with my closest 
ally. Do you accept?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034,"[Clanne] 
Um... I mean... If you say it's real, sure. Yes. 
Since this is definitely not a dream I'm having."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035,"[Alear] 
To care from the heart for someone other than 
yourself? Most people aren't capable of that."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#036,"[Alear] 
But you are, Clanne. And I am thankful for your 
service. And your friendship."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#037,"[Clanne] 
Me too!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#038,"[Clanne] 
Divine Dragon . This new duty is 
an honor! I will be your steward forever."
