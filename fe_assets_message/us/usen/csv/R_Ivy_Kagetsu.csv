[Kagetsu] 
Our time has come, Princess Ivy!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Let us draw anchor, hoist our mainsail, and set 
this boat of friendship on its maiden voyage!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
Hmm... It appears we are stuck in port."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps I was mistaken, and it is not yet time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Ivy] 
That's not it, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
Oh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Ivy] 
The truth is...I don't have many friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Ivy] 
When I was growing up, adults were always 
conniving and scheming."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Ivy] 
I grew to learn that was how the world worked."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Ivy] 
As a result...it was quite a long time before I 
met anyone I could trust enough to call a friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
As crown princess, you must have been limited 
in your contacts."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
I imagine it was cold and harsh to be raised 
in this type of environment."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Ivy] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Ivy] 
That's why I found you so disconcerting at first."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Ivy] 
When someone is friendly toward me right 
away, it's my instinct to be suspicious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Ivy] 
But you've never tried to take advantage of me. 
You don't seem to have any ulterior motives."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
Hahaha! Of course not! I am much too simple 
for schemes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Ivy] 
Until recently, I couldn't have hoped to 
understand your...purity."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Ivy] 
That's why you felt like an unknown. You could 
not be what you seemed, so...what were you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Ivy] 
Now I've realized you're exactly as you appear. 
That's your charm, in fact."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
Oh! Such kind words."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Ivy] 
So, Kagetsu... That's why..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Ivy] 
I would like us to be...friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Kagetsu] 
Are you certain? Wonderful, wonderful! 
Yes, Princess Ivy! Of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Kagetsu] 
Let us be friends until time itself comes to 
its end!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Ivy] 
Hm-hm! Yes, let's."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Ah! Princess Ivy! I was raised in Pale Sands."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Ivy] 
OK... Why are you telling me this?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
You said you dislike unknown quantities."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
So, I am going to tell you everything about 
myself. Then I will be known."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Ivy] 
Not the worst idea, I'll grant you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
Once you come to know me, we will no longer 
be princess and retainer, but friend and friend!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
It is worth trying, at least."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Ivy] 
Uh...haha..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
What else can I tell you? I have two siblings, 
brother and sister. Both younger. Very cute."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
My father has great swordsmanship. My mother 
has strange powers, which perhaps came to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
I care very much for my family, but I have also 
long dreamed to see the world at large."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
That is why I explained to them in writing my 
decision to leave. And I am on this journey now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
Oh no! Have I done something wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
How foolish of me! I should not have presumed 
you would wish to hear my entire life story."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
Please forgive me, Princess Ivy. I should have 
noticed sooner it was not what you wanted."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Ivy] 
No, that's not it. On the contrary, I am actually... 
rather pleased."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Ivy] 
I had no idea that becoming friends with me 
was so important to you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Ivy] 
I'm flattered. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
Ah, you are too kind!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Ivy] 
I don't dislike you, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Ivy] 
I do dislike unknowns. They make me wary. 
But that doesn't mean I dislike you as a person."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Ivy] 
And after today, I think it's safe to say my 
impression of you has improved."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Kagetsu] 
Wonderful! So, we may become friends soon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Ivy] 
Not the worst idea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes, I see it! Princess Ivy, dinner tonight shall 
be...bum-bum-ba-BA! Vegetable stir-fry!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Ivy] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
Your response is very underwhelming. Do you 
dislike stir-fry?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Ivy] 
I don't have strong feelings about the menu."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
Then what does it mean when your face wears 
this dubious look?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Ivy] 
I am thinking."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
You have the ability to see the future."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Ivy] 
You never predict anything important, but your 
predictions are correct every single time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
Kind of you to notice!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Ivy] 
It was not a compliment. I don't understand 
how you do it. I find it unsettling."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
I am unsettling? Why?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Ivy] 
You are an unknown quantity. I dislike 
unknown quantities."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
You dislike me, Princess Ivy? We each have our 
tastes, I suppose, but...this makes me sad."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
Wait! Even if you do not like me, I like you 
enough for both of us. So there is no problem!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Ivy] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Ivy] 
You are a strange one, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Kagetsu] 
Ah! There you are! There is your joy!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
To bring such joy to your face is at least some 
compensation for your dislike."
