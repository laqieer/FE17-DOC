Relax 
[Ike] 
I like that look in your eye. It's clear your 
fighting spirit is strong."

[Alear] Strike 

[Alear] 
I know the only way I'll beat you is to fight 
harder than you."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Ike] 
Then you understand what lies ahead."
MID_BT1_#004,"[Ike] 
Angry 
[Ike] 
Now show me you can fight as well as you talk."

[Timerra] 
It's kind of strange to face off against you. 
I mean, it was my duty to safeguard your ring."
MID_BT2_#002,"[Ike] b 
[Ike] 
Relax 
[Ike] 
Is it hard for you to see me as your opponent?"
MID_BT2_#003,"[Timerra] 
Relax 

[Timerra] 
No! I mean, I want to show you how strong 
I am!"
MID_BT2_#004,"[Ike] 
Angry 
[Ike] 
Good answer. Now show me what you can do!"

[Ike] 
There's something different about you, Fogado."
MID_BT3_#002,"[Fogado] t

Angry 

[Fogado] 
I decided since I was fighting you, I should 
be extra serious."
MID_BT3_#003,"[Ike] 
Angry 
[Ike] 
You have no intention of losing, then. I see."
MID_BT3_#004,"[Fogado] 
Relax 

[Fogado] 
Never. If we're doing this, then I've got to win."

[Ike] 
Great work, ! You overcame the 
trial well."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Ike."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Ike] 
You should know that, going forward, the 
fighting's going to get more intense."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Ike] 
It's important to remember that you're a leader, 
and you must not give in to the pressure."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Ike] 
In this war, there can be no retreat."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
You're right. If we run away, the world will be 
covered in darkness."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Alear] 
But I worry that fighting this hard may be too 
much for everyone. Or...too much for me..."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Ike] 
There are people who need your help. Don't 
worry. You are more than capable."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Ike] 
And when it seems your spirit might break, it's 
the bonds you've forged that will win the day."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
I'll hold your words in my heart."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Ike] 
Don't worry. If it looks like you've forgotten it, 
I'll be there to remind you."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Alear] 
You'll be by my side, always?"
MID_ED1_#013,"[Ike] 
Always."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Ike. I'm glad to know you're here 
with me."

[Alear] 
Where are we?"
MID_OP1_#002,"[Ike] 
Gebal Castle. At least, that's what it looks like."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
Someplace you've been?"
MID_OP1_#004,"[Ike] 
Yeah. It's near the border between the nations 
of Crimea and Gallia."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Ike] 
Interesting that this place is where we will have 
our trial."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Alear] 
Trial?"
MID_OP1_#007,"[Ike] 
We were pursued here by forces from the 
kingdom of Daein. They laid siege, trapping us."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Ike] 
Our escape was cut off. The strength of their 
forces was overwhelming."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Ike] 
My father had died, and I'd taken up his role 
as leader of the Greil Mercenaries."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Ike] 
And this is where I met my first great trial."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Alear] 
That sounds rough. What did you do?"
MID_OP1_#012,"[Ike] 
I fought─to protect my sister and the 
Greil Mercenaries."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Ike] 
If you found yourself in the same situation, 
what would you do?"
MID_OP1_#014,"[Alear] 
I'd like to think I would also fight. I don't want 
anyone I care about to be harmed."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Ike] 
And I believe you would fight well."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Ike] 
So show me how you would defend those near 
to you. No words now, only deeds."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Alear] 
A trial? You want me to fight you?"
MID_OP1_#018,"[Ike] 
If you win this fight, our bond will become 
even stronger."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Alear] 
Understood! I won't lose."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Ike] 
That's the spirit. Now, let's begin!"
