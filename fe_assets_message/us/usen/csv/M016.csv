MID_BT1_#001,"[Marni] b 
$ [Marni] Surprise 
[Marni] 
Huh? We came here to hunt a couple thieves. 
What are you punks doing here?"
MID_BT2_#001,"[Marni] b 
[Marni] 
Angry 
[Marni] 
Hahaha! Gotcha, sticky fingers! Wanna find out 
what I do to no-good traitors?"
MID_BT4_#001,"[Marni] b 
[Marni] Pain 
[Marni] 
Fine, we'll call it even. Next time, though? 
You're dead. Super-duper dead."
MID_BT5_#001,"[Mauvier] b 
[Mauvier] 
Angry 
[Mauvier] 
Hm. I should have guessed Hortensia's retainers 
would seek your forces out."
MID_BT6_#001,"[Mauvier] b 
[Mauvier] 
Angry 
[Mauvier] 
No mercy for mutineers."
MID_BT8_#001,"[Mauvier] b 
[Mauvier] Pain 
[Mauvier] 
I withdraw for now. But we will meet again."
MID_ED1_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
The Elusian soldiers have fled. Marni and 
Mauvier too."
MID_ED1_#002,Now we can head to Firene.
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alfred] 
Yes, right away! If those ships made landfall, 
then my people are in danger."
MID_ED2_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Zephia] 2 

[Griss] 3 
[Zephia] 
Ah, that cool breeze. Hm. Lovely, isn't it? 
Almost a shame we'll arrive in Firene soon."
MID_ED2_#002,"[Veyle] 
I'm surprised you came with us, Zephia."
MID_ED2_#003,"You're so loyal to Papa, I figured there was no 
way you'd approve of this."
MID_ED2_#004,"[Zephia] 
Oh? Well, your father is my master. But..."
MID_ED2_#005,"Lately, his orders have been somewhat 
concerning."
MID_ED2_#006,"[Veyle] 
I know exactly what you mean. He thinks 
nothing of killing people."
MID_ED2_#007,"I have the same blood in my veins, of course. 
Maybe it's natural people mistrust me."
MID_ED2_#008,"[Zephia] 
Oh, Lady Veyle, no. I heard about those awful 
things the Divine Dragon said."
MID_ED2_#009,"That you killed Lumera? Stole the rings? If I 
were you, I wouldn't believe a word of it."
MID_ED2_#010,"After hearing who your father was, the Divine 
Dragon probably said that to hurt your feelings."
MID_ED2_#011,"[Veyle] 
Hm. I've decided I won't harm anyone, ever. 
Even if it costs me my life."
MID_ED2_#012,"So I'm not going back to Papa. I don't want to 
destroy this world."
MID_ED2_#013,"[Zephia] 
How kindhearted of you."
MID_ED2_#014,"[Veyle] 
If you two really want to help, then after I've 
cleared up this misunderstanding..."
MID_ED2_#015,will you help me find my sibling?
MID_ED2_#016,"[Zephia] 
What a silly thing to say! You are Lord 
Sombron's only child."
MID_ED2_#017,You have no brothers or sisters.
MID_ED2_#018,"[Veyle] 
That's not true. We've met."
MID_ED2_#019,Look at this.
MID_ED2_#020,"[Zephia] 
How beautiful. It looks like a dragonstone."
MID_ED2_#021,"[Veyle] 
It is a dragonstone."
MID_ED2_#022,"A thousand years ago, I was crying and one of 
my siblings gave it to me. I remember it well."
MID_ED2_#023,"""Even though I can't stay with you, I'll always 
be your friend."""
MID_ED2_#024,"""If you're sad or lonely, remember...if this stone 
is intact, that means I'm still alive."""
MID_ED2_#025,"As you can see, in all this time, it hasn't 
even cracked."
MID_ED2_#026,"[Zephia] 
..."
MID_ED2_#027,"[Griss] 
But that means... What does that mean?"
MID_ED2_#028,"[Veyle] 
It means my brother is still alive, and I'm going 
to find him."
MID_ED2_#028_F,"[Veyle] 
It means my sister is still alive, and I'm going 
to find her."
MID_ED2_#029,"Perhaps with his help, I can convince Papa to 
end this horrible war."
MID_ED2_#029_F,"Perhaps with her help, I can convince Papa to 
end this horrible war."
MID_ED2_#030,"[Zephia] 
..."
MID_ED2_#031,"[Veyle] 
Zephia, is something wrong?"
MID_ED2_#032,"[Zephia] 
No, I'm just so...moved."
MID_ED2_#033,"After we've finished our business in Firene, 
Griss and I will help find your sibling."
MID_ED2_#034,"[Veyle] 
Thank you! I've been looking on my own this 
whole time. You two will be a big help."
MID_ED2_#035,"[Zephia] 
Look, Lady Veyle! Firene on the horizon."
MID_ED2_#036,"Why don't you take in the view? Maybe reflect 
on what you'll say to patch things up."
MID_ED2_#037,"[Veyle] 
Good idea."
MID_ED2_#038,"[Veyle] 
[Zephia] 
..."
MID_ED2_#039,"Another one of Lord Sombron's children 
survived?"
MID_ED2_#040,"[Griss] 
First I'm hearing of it."
MID_ED2_#041,"[Zephia] 
I don't understand... They all perished in the 
war a thousand years ago."
MID_ED2_#042,"All of them except Lady Veyle, who was too 
young to fight."
MID_ED2_#043,"I watched it happen, Griss. Watched as each and 
every one of them met their end."
MID_ED2_#044,Unless... No.
MID_ED2_#045,"[Griss] 
What? Remember something?"
MID_ED2_#046,"[Zephia] 
It's only a hunch. But if I'm right, we may have 
a problem on our hands."
MID_ED2_#047,"[Griss] 
Good thing we heard this before she fell asleep."
MID_ED2_#048,"[Zephia] 
Yes. After all, once we've gotten to Firene and 
uncovered the truth..."
MID_ED2_#049,she will never awaken again.
MID_EV1_#001,"[Marni] b 
[Marni]

[Marni] 
Finally! This is where those thieves ran off 
to, right?"
MID_EV1_#002,"[Mauvier] t 
[Mauvier] 
Angry 
[Mauvier] 
By all accounts, yes. Now we sniff them out."
MID_EV2_#001,"[Goldmary] t 
[Goldmary] Sad 
[Goldmary] 
Moments ago the beach was dry, and now the 
water is up to my ankles."
MID_EV2_#002,"The tide here seems to rise and fall at a 
moment's notice."
MID_EV2_#003,"Try to keep me on dry land, will you? Ugh, I'd 
hate to be stuck tromping around in the water..."
MID_EV3_#001,"[Rosado] t 
[Rosado] Pain 

[Rosado] 
Our side's cuter for sure, but by the looks of it, 
theirs might be tougher..."
MID_EV3_#002,"[Eirika] b 

[Eirika] 
Angry 

[Eirika] 
Worry not, Rosado. With my power, you can 
punch through even the hardiest foes' defenses."
MID_EV3_#003,"[Eirika] 
Relax 
You may also call upon my twin brother's 
abilities, if you like."
MID_EV4_#001,"村人おばさん t 
* 村人おばさん Surprise 
村人おばさん 
Yeah, I saw those troops on the shore. Be 
careful, all right? And take this. Might help."
MID_OP1_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
With Emblem Corrin added to our ranks, each 
country's rings have been collected."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Alfred] 
Right. No more rings in the wild. Between us 
and Sombron, they've all been taken."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
Let's consider the situation."
MID_OP1_#004,There are five Emblems on our side.
MID_OP1_#005,"Lyn, Lucina, Ike, Byleth, and now Corrin."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Alfred] 
Meanwhile, the Fell Dragon's got seven in his 
grubby claws─most of them our old allies."
MID_OP1_#007,"Marth, Sigurd, Celica, Micaiah, Leif, and Roy."
MID_OP1_#008,"As well as another Emblem Ring his forces stole 
from Lythos─the Azure Twins."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Alear] 
To gather all 12, we will need to face the 
enemy directly."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
Are you proposing we invade Elusia?"
MID_OP1_#011,"[Alfred] 
[Ivy] 1 

[Ivy] 
Returning to Elusia already..."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Timerra] 4 

[Timerra] 
Yeah, that's gotta be complicated."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Ivy] 
Indeed. But that aside, invading Elusia now 
would be a mistake."
MID_OP1_#014,"They have a clear advantage─seven Emblems 
to our five."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Alear] 
The worst-case scenario is that they steal more 
of our rings. That's what concerns me."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Ivy] 
If that happens, we can abandon all hope of 
defeating the Fell Dragon."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Alear] 
But the longer we wait to attack, the more likely 
it is they'll attack us."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Diamant] 
It's best that we strike first. One never wants to 
be on the wrong end of an ambush."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Ivy] 
[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
But we're not ready to take the offensive. 
Rock and a hard place, huh?"
MID_OP1_#020,"[Alfred] 

[Vander] 1 

[Vander] 
Pardon the interruption."
MID_OP1_#021,"[Alear] 
Vander. What is it?"
MID_OP1_#022,"[Vander] 
Word from the port of Solm─a number of 
warships were spotted on the horizon."
MID_OP1_#023,"Judging from the crests on their sails, they 
appear to be Elusian vessels."
MID_OP1_#024,"[Alear] 
They're attacking the queendom again?"
MID_OP1_#025,"[Vander] 
No, in fact...the fleet sails toward Firene."
MID_OP1_#026,"[Vander] 
[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
My kingdom..."
MID_OP1_#027,"[Alear] 
We'd better take a look for ourselves."
MID_OP1_#028,"[Timerra] 
Let's head to the Azure Coast. It's near the 
border, and it's got a clear view of the sea."
MID_OP2_#001,"[Marni] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Marni] 
♪Hmm-hmm♪ Smooth sailing! At this rate, 
we'll be the first ones in Firene."
MID_OP2_#002,"[Mauvier] 
It would seem so."
MID_OP2_#003,"[Marni] 
Wonder why Zephia told us to go ahead... Our 
orders are to kill everyone we see, right?"
MID_OP2_#004,"With this kinda head start, think of the body 
count we can get. We'll be heroes!"
MID_OP2_#005,"Seems like Zephia's really taken a shine to us. 
Don'tcha think, Mauvier?"
MID_OP2_#006,"[Mauvier] 
I do not particularly care. I have my orders and 
I will follow them."
MID_OP2_#007,"[Marni] 
Ugh! See, this is why I can't stand you. You 
never praise me, and you're no fun at all!"
MID_OP2_#008,"I thought Griss was bad! At least he's not the 
boringest man in the world..."

current strategy."

Whatever. Leave them be. We'll catch up later

MID_OP2_#020,Warships are already in pursuit.
MID_OP2_#021,"[Mauvier]

they went?"

We're in Solm now. I think it's safe to say we 
lost them."

Perhaps we should pause for a moment, then? 
I'm sure your wyvern needs to rest her wings."
MID_OP3_#003,"[Rosado] 
Good idea. Let's take a breather and then start 
looking for Hortensia."
