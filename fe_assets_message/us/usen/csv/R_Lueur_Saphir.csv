[Saphir] 2 

[Saphir] 
Divine One... I'm sorry for how I reacted 
to what you said about the way I fight."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
Please, don't apologize. It was insensitive 
of me to pry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
You weren't wrong. I'm still holding on to 
hatred of Elusia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
But being the only one who lived...somehow 
that's even more unforgivable."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Saphir] 
If my friend had survived the attack instead of 
me, Brodia's knights would be stronger for it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Saphir] 
I think that's why I go all out in every battle. 
Trying to make up for the loss."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
Thank you for confiding in me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
Hearing it actually makes me feel a lot better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Saphir] 
How do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
If you trained so hard purely for revenge, 
I'd have to try to talk you out of it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
Even if it leads to strength, that path is too full 
of grief to follow."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
But now I see that you push yourself to fulfill 
the wish of someone you care about."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
I'm sure your friend appreciates it, but I still 
don't think it's worth the pain you're carrying."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alear] 
If I were her...I'd just want you to be happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Saphir] 
You know...I never even considered that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Saphir] 
Maybe you're right. We are talking about 
one of the kindest people I've ever met."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Saphir] 
But how can you be so sure what she'd think 
in this situation, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
It's easy to know that sort of thing when you 
care about a person."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Saphir] 
Ah..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
Was that the wrong answer?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Saphir] 
No, of course not. It's...nice to hear."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Saphir] 
Thank you, Divine One. It means a lot to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Saphir] 2 

[Saphir] 
OK, that's enough sparring for today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
Thanks again for indulging me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Saphir] 
There really is such kindness in your eyes, even 
when you're fighting. It's refreshing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Saphir] 
Anyway, thanks for the warm-up. I'm off to do 
some strength training."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
One training session straight to another? 
Your stamina's amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Saphir] 
When training is all you have, you give it all 
you've got."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
What do you mean, ""training is all you have""?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Saphir] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Saphir] 
Yeah, OK. I don't usually talk about this, but 
you deserve an answer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Saphir] 
I've always been strong, even as a kid. But back 
in those days, I had a friend I could never beat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Saphir] 
This friend trained hard─and I mean hard─with 
the goal of becoming the strongest knight ever."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Saphir] 
One day, Elusia attacked my village. My friend 
was killed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Saphir] 
After that, I figured someone should honor her 
wish to be the strongest. Might as well be me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
I'm so sorry for your loss."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
I can't help but feel that isn't the only reason 
you train so hard, though."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Saphir] 
What makes you say that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
That ferocity when you fight...it doesn't feel 
like grief to me. It feels more like vengeance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Saphir] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Saphir] 
I really should get back to training. Muscles'll 
tighten up if I stand around too long."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Saphir] 
Thanks for letting me talk your ear off, though. 
I'll see you later."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alear] 
Saphir..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alear] 
I went too far. I should apologize..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Saphir] 2 

[Alear] 
Thank you for sparring with me, Saphir."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Saphir] 
No problem. Always a pleasure to find an 
opponent who can help me work up a sweat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
Glad to hear it, since I barely kept up. I see now 
why Brodia holds you in such high regard."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Saphir] 
Don't be too modest. You're good, and you've 
got lots of room to grow."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Saphir] 
Strength, skill, speed... You're full of potential. 
Keep training─you'll see."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alear] 
Maybe, but what I really envy is your intensity. 
The way you press the attack...it's relentless."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
Do you think I've got the potential to be as 
ferocious a fighter as you are?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Saphir] 
That's..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
Saphir?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Saphir] 
Ah, sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Saphir] 
Listen... You'd be better off not modeling your 
fighting style too much after mine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Saphir] 
Ferocity doesn't suit you. You're too kind 
a person for it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Saphir] 
Just be yourself, and hang on tight to that 
kindness. Don't let it go."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
I understand, Saphir. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Saphir] 2 

[Alear] 
Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Saphir] 
Hah, nice one. I yield."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
Thanks for the match."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
That's enough training for today, though. 
Phew, you really wore me out."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Saphir] 
You gave it your all today, Divine One. That was 
some intense stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Saphir] 
I know I said you had potential, but even I didn't 
expect you to develop so quickly."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
If I have, it's thanks to you─and not just 
your encouragement."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
I want to be strong enough to protect you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Saphir] 
Protect me?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
Haha, I'm not sure I've ever seen you 
blush before."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Saphir] 
No one's ever said anything like that to me 
before. I have no idea how to respond."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
However ferocious you might be, you still 
have a tender heart."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
I love that about you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
That's why I want you to have the Pact Ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Saphir] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
You're the person I care for most. This ring 
is a symbol of how precious you are to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
So, what do you say? Sparring partners forever?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Saphir] 
I..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Saphir] 
Can I really let myself be so...happy?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
I know it might seem impossible. You've been 
through so much pain and struggle."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
But that's exactly why you deserve to have 
some happiness."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Saphir] 
You're right, . Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Saphir] 
I'll take this ring and your offer happily."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Good, because I'm going to be there for you 
from now until the end."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Saphir] 
That goes both ways. I'll fight with all I have 
to protect you...and to make you happy."
