[Alear] 
Merrin, listen. I'm sorry for blowing up at you 
the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Merrin] 
""Blowing up"" is a bit strong..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
I didn't understand that you were observing me 
so closely because you genuinely care."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
No... I was in the wrong, not you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Merrin] 
I was completely oblivious to how my actions 
made you feel."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
You know...now that we understand each other 
better, I'd be happy to help you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
There aren't many books about Divine Dragons, 
and nobody's asked me about my life before."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
You want to fill that gap─help people learn 
about me. I can see the value in that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
What I'm trying to say is...please, observe to 
your heart's content."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Merrin] 
Really?! You mean it?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
I mean it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Merrin] 
Thank you, Divine One! I really appreciate that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Merrin] 
When I'm observing you, I forget about all the 
stress and worry. Everything bad slips away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Merrin] 
I just feel...joyful! And I want to share that joy 
with others, you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
Haha! You're truly one of a kind, Merrin. Maybe 
I should write a book about you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Merrin] 
You flatter me, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
I do have a request. Stop thinking of me as 
""more than human,"" all right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
I may be the only Divine Dragon, but hey. 
You're one of a kind too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Merrin] 
Hehe, you make a good point! I guess we're 
both rare critters, aren't we?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
Exactly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
Oh, and also? I want to be the first to read this 
book of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Merrin] 
Of course! I can't think of anyone better to 
fact-check it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
Merrin... It's difficult to train with you staring at 
me like that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Merrin] 
Don't mind me. I'm not even here."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Merrin] 
I'm simply observing your behaviors to gather 
material for my book."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
And how long do you plan to do that, exactly?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Merrin] 
As long as it takes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Merrin] 
Don't you worry. I'm not going to stop until I've 
captured every last detail!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
Oh, please, cut it out!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Merrin] 
What? I was just..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
You were just nothing! I'm not one of your 
critters, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alear] 
Yes, I am a dragon. I live longer than humans 
and have certain unique abilities."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
But I also have feelings. I don't appreciate being 
gawked at like an animal."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Merrin] 
Divine One, I'm so sorry!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Merrin] 
It's just that...to me, you are more than human."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Merrin] 
You're a truly divine being. I wanted to make 
sure future generations understood that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Merrin] 
In hopes that they would protect you, the one 
and only Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Merrin] 
But I never meant for you to feel like some kind 
of research specimen."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
I know you didn't. It's all right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Merrin] 
No, it's not! Because that's exactly how I made 
you feel, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Merrin] 
Forget about the book. I'll stop writing it. 
I'm sorry, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alear] 
Merrin, please! It's really OK!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Divine One, I have something to discuss with 
you, if it's not too much trouble."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Oh? No, it's no trouble at all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
But first, you can loosen up a little. I don't bite, 
I promise."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Merrin] 
Aha, of course! Forgive me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Merrin] 
I've been working up the courage to ask you 
about this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Merrin] 
See, I love rare critters, and I especially 
love dragons."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
So, you think of me as a...rare critter?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Merrin] 
Well, you're rare at least. You're the world's 
only Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Merrin] 
So I was hoping you'd help me understand your 
species a little better."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
Um... Wow."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Merrin] 
What's wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
Nothing, nothing. Please, go ahead."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Merrin] 
All right, I'll cut to the chase, then. Tell me, 
what is a typical day like for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
Let's see... Someone wakes me up in the 
morning. I eat breakfast. I train until noon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alear] 
I live like a normal person, to be honest. 
Is that helpful?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Merrin] 
Very! Basic activity is much like that of an 
average human..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Wait... Are you writing all this down?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Merrin] 
Of course. This is excellent material for the 
book I'm working on about you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alear] 
Book?! You don't think that's a little much?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Merrin] 
What do you mean? Future generations deserve 
to know all about the Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Alear] 
I, uh... I guess so."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Divine One! I've finished a draft of my book! 
Would you mind giving it a read?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
I'd be happy to. Let me take a look..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
""The Divine Dragon awoke in a 
floating castle after 1,000 years of slumber..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
""Humble and kind, the Divine Dragon fought 
with a courageous heart to protect the people."""
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
I think I'm starting to blush..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Merrin] 
It is the truth."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
""The Divine Dragon can live thousands of years 
and possesses powers that humans do not."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
""However, this dragon's habitat and behaviors 
are no different than those of a typical human."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
""And let it be noted, the Divine Dragon is the 
most precious being in the world to the author."""
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
Merrin, this is..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Merrin] 
I'm sorry. I had to write it. Don't worry, I'll cut it 
from the final copy. It's just..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Merrin] 
Divine One, I need you to know how important 
you are to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Merrin] 
And I want people to always remember there 
was a human who cared very deeply for you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
I want you to leave it in."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Merrin] 
I don't..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
And please add this: ""The author of the book 
was equally as precious to the Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
""So much so, the Divine Dragon gave Merrin the 
Pact Ring and vowed to be with her always."""
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Merrin] 
D-Divine One! You cannot give me something 
so precious!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
If you care so very deeply for me, you have 
to accept it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
Your book must tell the truth─that the Divine 
Dragon adored a human named Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Merrin] 
If that's how you feel. Thank you, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
When this incredible book is done, I hope people 
will see that I'm not so different from them."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Merrin] 
Yes, there's just one problem. I can't finish 
it yet."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
Why not?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Merrin] 
I have to write about our life together─about 
how a human and dragon cared for one another."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
You make a good point, Merrin. And I can't wait 
to write that part of the story with you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Merrin] 
Yes!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Merrin] 
I adore you, Divine One. The stories we write 
together will be told for thousands of years."
