[Citrinne] 
What am I going to do..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Does Diamant even understand how a future 
king should behave?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
I heard my name. Did you need me for 
something, Citrinne?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Oh. No, I was just...talking to myself. Do you 
need me for something?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Diamant] 
I just came by to let you know that I sent the 
nobles a letter."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Citrinne] 
You did what?! Why? You promised you 
wouldn't make things worse!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Diamant] 
Don't panic. I didn't mention you at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Diamant] 
I made it clear that I won't wage any wars, but 
will prioritize a prosperous future for Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Citrinne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Diamant] 
That should put a stop to the rumors, right? 
No more whispers of collusion."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Yes, I believe that will do it..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Citrinne] 
I'm sorry you had to resolve this, Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Diamant] 
No, I should have sent a reply myself. I'm sorry 
that I passed my duty on to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Citrinne] 
And I should have been more direct. It was my 
attempted sweet-talking that led to the rumors."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Citrinne] 
I hope things settle down soon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Citrinne] 
I miss dancing my cares away, and it's starting 
to feel like I'll never attend another formal ball..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Diamant] 
That depends on how well I do my job."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Citrinne] 
You mean how well we do our jobs."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Diamant] 
You're right. We'll need everyone to work 
together to bring peace to Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Diamant] 
I hope you'll keep pushing me forward, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Citrinne] 
Of course I will. We are close cousins, after all. 
Practically siblings."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Diamant] 
Yes, it has felt that way. I hope that never 
changes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Citrinne] 
Diamant, would you like to play a game of tag? 
Just like we used to?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Diamant] 
Are you sure you wouldn't rather play princess?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Citrinne] 
No, I'm in a rare mood for tag─and this time, 
you're it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Citrinne] 2 
[Diamant] 
Citrinne! Thanks again for giving the nobles my 
answer. It's been nice to have that off my back."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Diamant] 
Sorry if it was a hassle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Citrinne] 
There is no need for royalty to apologize to a 
simple retainer, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Diamant] 
""Prince"" Diamant? You never call me that. 
Is everything OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Citrinne] 
Everything is fine. Please excuse me, my prince. 
I have an errand I must attend to..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Diamant] 
Hold it. Tell me what's going on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Please, Diamant, I'm in a very awkward 
position."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Diamant] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Citrinne] 
It's dangerous for me to be seen speaking so 
casually with the heir to Brodia's throne."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Diamant] 
We're cousins. We've known each other our 
whole lives. Where is this coming from?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Citrinne] 
The nobles did not care for your response. 
I must be cautious in my exchanges with you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Citrinne] 
Rumors are quickly spreading that my family 
has been colluding with Brodia's future king."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Diamant] 
Ah...I see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Diamant] 
I placed more of a burden on you than I ever 
could have imagined, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Citrinne] 
It's quite all right, Prince Diamant. I─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Diamant] 
I shouldn't have asked you to do my job for me. 
I'm going to clear this up. Right now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Citrinne] 
No! You'll only complicate things further."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Diamant] 
I have no choice. I've been robbed of my cousin 
and have to get her back."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Citrinne] 
Ooh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Citrinne] 
Very well. I surrender."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Citrinne] 
I'll resume our usual, casual banter...like making 
you promise not to kick down any doors."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Diamant] 
That's more like it. And don't worry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Citrinne] 
""Don't worry"" is not a promise, Diamant. I need 
to hear you say it. Do not make things worse!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Diamant] 
I promise. Trust your cousin, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Citrinne] 2 
[Diamant] 
Hah! Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Citrinne] 
There you are, Diamant. I thought I might find 
you here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Diamant] 
Citrinne. I don't remember telling anyone where 
I was going to be training."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Well, I know this is your preferred escape when 
something is bothering you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Diamant] 
Heh. Can't hide from you. Guess I haven't 
changed much since I was a kid."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Citrinne] 
We used to play in these castle gardens all 
the time, remember?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
I would try to play princess, but you always 
turned it into a game of tag."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Diamant] 
Of course. Tag makes for good training."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Diamant] 
So..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Diamant] 
Is this about that letter from the nobles?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Indeed. They're eager for a response."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Citrinne] 
I've been sent here to ask you directly about 
your stance on future military campaigns."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Citrinne] 
These nobles are acquaintances of my family. 
As a noble myself, I can't ignore their demands."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Citrinne] 
Diamant, don't send me back empty-handed. 
I don't have the energy for tag anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Diamant] 
War is profitable. The nobility is expecting to 
line their pockets for years to come."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Diamant] 
I, on the other hand, do not intend to wage any 
wars during my reign as king."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Citrinne] 
I'm so glad to hear that. The nobles won't like 
it, but you can leave them to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Diamant] 
Sorry to make you the messenger."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Citrinne] 
It's fine. I'll take this over the diplomatic battles 
you must survive in the royal court any day."
