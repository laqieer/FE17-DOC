[Merrin] 
Ha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Chloé] 
You can do it, Merrin!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
Yes, I can!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
HA!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Merrin] 
Hahaha, I did it! I pulled off the finishing 
move perfectly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Chloé] 
Beautifully done, Merrin!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Merrin] 
And I have you to thank for it, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Merrin] 
You've been helping me with my training since 
this morning, and the long hours are paying off."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Merrin] 
I am grateful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Chloé] 
But are you sure you want to train with me? 
Aren't there others who are more qualified?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Merrin] 
No. I wouldn't have anyone else."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Chloé] 
How come?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Merrin] 
Honestly, you're one of the few friends I feel 
I can be...uncool...around."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Merrin] 
I don't have to worry you'll be disenchanted 
if your fairy-tale knight isn't quite flawless."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Merrin] 
I am so grateful for that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Chloé] 
Hah, so that's it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Chloé] 
You know, I'm not the only one who feels 
that way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Chloé] 
Who could be disenchanted with you? It doesn't 
matter if you stumble sometimes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Chloé] 
Everyone knows how cool you are, and a few 
mistakes won't change that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Chloé] 
We know you have the true spirit of a knight 
inside."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Merrin] 
Chloé, I have to say..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Merrin] 
I feel so lucky to have met you, and I'd be 
honored if you'd go on fighting by my side."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Chloé] 
It would be a dream come true, Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
HA!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Merrin] 
Hahaha, well, well. I landed that finishing blow 
beautifully, if I do say so myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Merrin] 
Still, more practice is in order. Perfection is the 
only option on the battlefield."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Merrin] 
Ha-AH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Merrin] 
Whoa! What the─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Merrin] 
AHH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Chloé] 1 
[Chloé] 
Oh no, Merrin! Are you OK?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Merrin] 
Chloé? How long have you been watching me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Chloé] 
Quite a while now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Chloé] 
I would've said something sooner, but I didn't 
want to interrupt your training."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Merrin] 
Ugh... I wish you hadn't seen me looking so... 
so uncool!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Merrin] 
Knights never make such sloppy mistakes in 
fairy tales. I'm sure you're disenchanted now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Chloé] 
Aw, it's OK, Merrin. Uh-oh, you scraped your 
forehead. Let's get that taken care of."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Merrin] 
I feel so pathetic."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Chloé] 
It was just one silly mistake. Don't beat yourself 
up over it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Chloé] 
When I think about you, I think about how hard 
you work, not about how you messed up once."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Chloé] 
You're still a gallant knight from a fairy tale 
in my eyes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Merrin] 
Chloé... Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Chloé] 
Besides, I said I'd take care of you, didn't I?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Merrin] 
Haha, you did. Though, this isn't quite the same 
as an upset stomach."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Merrin] 
But perhaps messing up isn't so bad. Especially 
if someone like you ends up taking care of me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Chloé] 
Oh, hello, Merrin!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Merrin] 
Well hello, Chloé. You're looking beautiful, 
as always."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Merrin] 
You know, I saw these blossoms and 
immediately thought of you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Merrin] 
One beauty deserves another. I hope you 
like them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Chloé] 
Wow... That's really sweet of you, Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Chloé] 
You're so charming and cool...like a knight out 
of a fairy tale."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Merrin] 
Me? Charming and cool?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Merrin] 
Haha, you're much too kind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Merrin] 
Hey, I happen to have some sweets. They're 
delicious. Care to share them with me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Chloé] 
Aww, what a nice surprise! I would love to."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Merrin] 
Today is shaping up to be a fine day, indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Chloé] 
Let's sit over there, with the nice view. We can 
share your sweets and my pickled fish guts."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Merrin] 
Sorry, did you say pickled...guts?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Chloé] 
I bet you they'll go perfectly with the sweets."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Merrin] 
Eh, I'm not so sure about that. Honestly, the 
combination sounds fairly wretched."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Chloé] 
You never know until you try, though."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Merrin] 
Perhaps just one bite, if you insist. But if I get 
an upset stomach, you have to take care of me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Chloé] 
I'd be happy to. Shall we brave the unknown 
together, Merrin?"
