[Boucheron] 
I've done it! I've finally reached the cabin! 
Forest Sage, here I come!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Excellent, you have *arrived.* Welcome. I am the 
Forest Sage."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Huh? Is that...Zelkov?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Boucheron] 
I... I don't understand. What's going on?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Zelkov] 
As promised, here is your *medicine.* Go on, 
try it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Boucheron] 
Uh...OK."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Boucheron] 
It's sweet. It tastes like, uh...candy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Zelkov] 
Correct. It is nothing more than a *confection.* 
Perhaps it will put a slight spring in your step."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Zelkov] 
As for your *sense* of direction...you did reach 
this remote cabin with very little help."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Perhaps that *suggests* something about the 
state of your abilities."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Boucheron] 
Oooh! I got better without even realizing it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Zelkov] 
*Precisely.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Zelkov] 
I had heard rumors of this weakness of yours. 
*Correcting* it seemed like a worthy project."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Zelkov] 
That is how the *Forest Sage* came to be. 
I devised this stratagem to lead you here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Boucheron] 
You went to a lot of trouble."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Zelkov] 
Elaborate *pursuits* are a passion of mine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Zelkov] 
At first, I thought I would simply *train* you in 
navigation. But that was much too simple."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Zelkov] 
I required a more intricate plan, and so I devised 
*this.* I hope you enjoyed the experience."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Boucheron] 
You know what? I did. Thanks for putting all 
this together for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Zelkov] 
You are every bit the *gentleman* I had heard. 
Some would be angry about the deception."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Boucheron] 
Angry? Don't be silly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Boucheron] 
I really appreciated the ""Forest Sage."" I even 
hoped we might be friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Zelkov] 
Why is *that*?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Boucheron] 
Well, I remembered that nice letter they left for 
me and the blanket they covered me with."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Boucheron] 
It was obvious how much they cared. In my 
mind, they seemed pretty swell."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Zelkov] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Boucheron] 
There's just one problem... I doubt this has 
done anything for my sense of direction."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Zelkov] 
What? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Boucheron] 
You're not the first person to coach me on how 
to correct my mistakes there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Boucheron] 
None of it's worked. That's why I really had my 
heart set on that medicine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Boucheron] 
But in the end, it was only sugar."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Zelkov] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Boucheron] 
Are you OK, Zelkov? Sorry about this. I know 
it must be disappointing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Zelkov] 
Oh, no, my friend. *Quite* the opposite."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Zelkov] 
This proves to be a grander *game* than I had 
anticipated. I am excited to plot my next move."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Boucheron] 
Your next move? You mean to do it again?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038,"[Zelkov] 
Soon, you will receive a missive from the Ocean 
Sage. I hope you will *attend* to their words."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#039,"[Boucheron] 
Hahaha, all right. As you wish, O great 
sage Zelkov."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Ah, Boucheron. What became of the Forest 
Sage *situation*?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Well... I tried to meet them, but...I got lost on 
the way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Zelkov] 
An *unforeseen* turn of events, to be sure."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Boucheron] 
It was strange, though."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Boucheron] 
I took a nap in an empty cave, and when I woke 
up, there was a letter from the Forest Sage."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Zelkov] 
Go on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Boucheron] 
It was full of encouragement, like ""You're close,"" 
""You got this,"" and ""Don't give up."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Zelkov] 
*Extraordinary.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Boucheron] 
That's not all. It explained which wrong turns 
I'd made to get so lost."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Boucheron] 
And it offered advice on what I could do to get 
better at finding my way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Zelkov] 
I wonder about the *motivations* of this 
so-called Forest Sage."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Zelkov] 
They could have simply left the *medicine* with 
this note, but chose not to do so. Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Boucheron] 
It must be really important, for some reason, 
that I make it to that cabin."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Zelkov] 
A *mysterious* sage, to say the least."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Yeah. I've made up my mind, though. I'm going 
to reach that cabin, no matter what."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Zelkov] 
I admire your *determination.* Allow me once 
more to wish you luck."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Boucheron] 
Thanks. Fingers crossed that next time, I'll have 
good news for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Is this a good idea?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Is something the *matter*?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Look at this. It's an invitation from someone 
called the ""Forest Sage."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Zelkov] 
I am *unfamiliar* with the moniker."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Boucheron] 
Me too. But they want me to go to their cabin."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Zelkov] 
Oh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Boucheron] 
See this map of the mountain they drew?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Boucheron] 
It says if I can get to the cabin, they'll give me 
special medicine to fix my sense of direction."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Boucheron] 
I didn't know such a thing existed, but 
according to this, it does."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Zelkov] 
A cure for poor direction sense? Does the world 
truly hold such *wonders*?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Boucheron] 
I hope so. The thing is, my sense of direction, 
honestly, is pretty bad."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Boucheron] 
The other day, I went out for a walk holding 
a compass, and I STILL got lost."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Zelkov] 
Most *concerning.* So, what will you do?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Boucheron] 
What else can I do but go?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Boucheron] 
This has been a problem, and not just for me. 
If a potion really can fix it, I have to try."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Zelkov] 
Then allow me to wish you good *fortune.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Boucheron] 
Thanks. Here's hoping it helps!"
