[Jean] 
Sir, I'm sorry I was so rude last time. I didn't 
mean to fall asleep in the middle of a lesson."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Lindon] 
You have nothing to apologize for. Getting you 
some rest was the whole point."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
Although there was a lesson to be learned 
there from the flowers."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jean] 
There was?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Lindon] 
Don't be in such a hurry that you neglect to 
take rests. You'll miss the forest for the trees."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jean] 
Aw..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jean] 
I admit, I did have an easier time concentrating 
on that book once I got home from the meadow."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Lindon] 
Aha! Glad to hear it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jean] 
Sir? Would you do me the honor of taking me 
on as a student?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Lindon] 
Who, me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Jean] 
I learned a lot from that lesson."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jean] 
I need more than books. It would be better if I 
had a whole range of knowledge and expertise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jean] 
That's the kind of thing a master sage like you 
could offer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lindon] 
Hm-hm, a master sage, huh?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Jean] 
Should I not call you that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lindon] 
No, no. The title is fine. It's just..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Lindon] 
I have a lot to teach, and I'm getting on in years. 
I might end before my curriculum does."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jean] 
I wouldn't worry too much about that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jean] 
I'm still learning, but as your doctor, I'll see to 
it that you stay in good health."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Lindon] 
Hm-hm, so that's the deal, eh? Well played, 
well played."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lindon] 
I accept, then. From now on, consider yourself 
my student."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Jean] 
Thank you, sir! I'll make you proud!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
Here we are, Jean. Your new classroom."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Jean] 
A meadow?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Jean] 
Why are we here? I don't see anyone who 
could teach me anything."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lindon] 
Look harder, then."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jean] 
Um...where?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Lindon] 
The flowers blooming all around us. They'll be 
your teachers for today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Jean] 
Heh, you're kidding, right, sir?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lindon] 
Oh, not at all. I'm very serious."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lindon] 
You've exhausted yourself, lad, both physically 
and mentally."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Lindon] 
Nothing you could read in a book right now will 
teach you as much as these flowers can."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Lindon] 
Humor me and take a seat at my side."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Jean] 
OK... If you say so."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Lindon] 
Now lie back slowly and look up at the sky. 
Then take a long, deep breath."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jean] 
OK..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Jean] 
Like that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lindon] 
My goodness, do you hear that? The flowers 
are whispering to you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jean] 
They are?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Jean] 
I don't hear anything."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Lindon] 
Hmm. Try relaxing your shoulders more and 
turning your ears toward them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Jean] 
Um..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Jean] 
I still don't hear anything."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Jean] 
They smell good, though. And there's a nice 
breeze in the air."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Lindon] 
Is that so? Then maybe you should take it all 
in more fully."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Jean] 
I'll do just that..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Jean] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Jean] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Lindon] 
Asleep at last. And about time too."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Lindon] 2 
[Jean] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jean] 
It's no use. I'm so tired that none of this 
is registering."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Lindon] 
Is there a problem, lad?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Jean] 
Hello, sir. I was just trying to get through 
this book."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lindon] 
Reading at this late hour, are you? I admire 
your determination. What are you studying?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jean] 
Medicine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lindon] 
Hmm... You look tired. It must be hard to focus 
so late at night."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jean] 
I know I haven't gotten much sleep, but there's 
just so much to memorize."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lindon] 
Battles by day, studies by night... The candle 
that burns at both ends doesn't last long, lad."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Lindon] 
You'll wear out your own body long before 
you learn to care for anyone else's."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jean] 
I know you're right. It's just..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lindon] 
You'd be better served closing those books for 
now and giving yourself a change of pace."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Jean] 
But I still have so much to learn!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lindon] 
Books are wonderful teachers, lad, but there 
are lessons they can't impart."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Lindon] 
It might be time you looked somewhere else 
to learn a thing or two."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lindon] 
Do that, and you might find that you'll get more 
out of your books when you return to them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Jean] 
You really think that's true?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Lindon] 
I do indeed. Give me a few days, and I'll see 
about setting up a lesson for you."
