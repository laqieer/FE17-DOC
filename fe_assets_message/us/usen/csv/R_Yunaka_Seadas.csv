MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Seadall] 
Yunaka...what's wrong? Where's that 
boundless joy of yours gone?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
I can't do it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
I can't face the audience─it's too much! 
I've gotta sit this one out! I'm sorry!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Seadall] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Seadall] 
You were excited to get up on stage the last 
time I saw you. What happened?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Yunaka] 
All the nice things you said, choosing me as the 
lead... It was all really flattering."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Yunaka] 
But I've never had so many people depending 
on me before. What if I'm a letdown?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Yunaka] 
They're here to enjoy themselves. Can they 
really do that with someone like me on stage?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Seadall] 
Yunaka, did you enjoy acting and dancing 
during our rehearsals? Was it fun performing?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Of course it was."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Seadall] 
Well, if you enjoyed it, then the audience will 
enjoy it too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Seadall] 
If you don't trust yourself on this, can you at 
least trust me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Seadall] 
I promise you, everyone is going to have a 
good time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Seadall] 
My eyes are closed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Seadall] 
My hand is here. If you trust me, then take it... 
and never let go."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Yunaka] 
Your lines... Why are you..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Seadall] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Yunaka] 
If you're certain this is what you want... 
I'm willing to believe in you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Seadall] 
Thank you for taking my hand. You are meant 
to be on that stage, Yunaka."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Yunaka] 
Hehe, as long as I've got your guarantee, I can 
honestly say I feel a lot better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Seadall] 
Soon everyone will see you for the talented 
performer I know you to be."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Yunaka] 
Thanks, Seadall."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Yunaka] 
OK, let's not keep 'em waiting."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Yunaka] 
There's a lot of folks out there counting on us 
to make them smile!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Please, find it in your heart to stay. Let me 
dance by your side forever..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Please don't hold me back. It will only serve to 
sharpen the pain of our parting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Seadall] 
My eyes are closed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Seadall] 
My hand is here. If you trust me, then take it... 
and never let go."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Yunaka] 
If you're certain this is what you want... 
I'm willing to believe in you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Yunaka] 
So long as we're together, from now until 
the end..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Seadall] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Seadall] 
Your performance...the nuance and honesty... 
I was right. You are gifted. More than I knew."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Yunaka] 
Aaah, I'm not so sure. I really don't have any 
experience with acting. This is all so new to me!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Seadall] 
Yunaka, your impressions are brilliant... 
because you're a brilliant actor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Seadall] 
And this show will be unforgettable because 
you will be an unforgettable lead."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Yunaka] 
I'm playing the lead?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Seadall] 
Well, I thought I'd be the lead. But now I know 
better. That role was meant for you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Seadall] 
We still have to practice the dance, but I have 
no doubt you can handle it, Yunaka."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Seadall] 
It's not easy putting on a show when times are 
hard like this. Dancing, laughing...it feels wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Seadall] 
But it's because times are hard that I have to do 
it─to remind the audience what joy feels like."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Seadall] 
I want this performance to succeed...for 
everyone's sake. Will you help me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Yunaka] 
I understand how you feel. And I respect that, 
honestly. OK... I'll help as best I can."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Seadall] 
Thank you. I can't do it without you, Yunaka."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Seadall] 
Together, I think we can make this one of the 
truly great performances."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Yunaka, I heard a rumor that you're very good 
at doing impressions. Is that true?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Zappy! I do them from time to time, for a giggle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Yunaka] 
Want a demonstration? Here goes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Yunaka] 
""I am Emblem Corrin. I'll fight with all I have!"""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Yunaka] 
Or how about..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Yunaka] 
""I am Ivy, crown princess of Elusia."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Yunaka] 
You get the idea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Seadall] 
Finally...I've found you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Yunaka] 
You were looking?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Seadall] 
Yunaka, please, I need you to join me on stage."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Yunaka] 
By ""stage,"" I take it you mean...the kind where 
you get in front of people and sing and dance?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Seadall] 
Exactly that kind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Seadall] 
I've been choreographing a stage play, and I am 
in need of an actor."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Yunaka] 
Ah! Nope! I can't do it! What you're describing 
is totally impossible."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Seadall] 
I'll guide you through it. I swear, I won't let this 
be a bad experience for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Seadall] 
Please, Yunaka. I can't make this performance 
happen without you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Yunaka] 
Heh, you sound so sure..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Yunaka] 
If that's really how you feel about it...I guess 
I can give it a try."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Seadall] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Yunaka] 
Just remember, if it turns out I'm terrible at this, 
I did warn you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Seadall] 
I promise you, there won't be any blame... 
only gratitude."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Seadall] 
I know what I've just seen. A gifted performer in 
the making."
