[Marth] 
Much has come to pass─meetings, farewells, 
and reunions alike. How are you faring?"
MID_BT1_#002,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] Status 

[Alear] 
I could never put those feelings into words. 
So...I'll answer you with my weapon."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Marth] 
Angry 
[Marth] 
I would ask for nothing less!"
MID_BT1_#004,"[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
Here I come!"
MID_BT2_#001,"[Veyle] t 
[Veyle] Sad 

[Veyle] 
Marth? Do I really have to fight you? I...I don't 
want to hurt any of my friends."
MID_BT2_#002,"[Marth] b 
[Marth] 
Smile 
[Marth] 
I am of no consequence to you. This battle is 
about conquering oneself."
MID_BT2_#003,"[Veyle] Strike 

[Veyle] 
Conquering oneself... Ah, I understand. I must 
conquer the Veyle I used to be!"
MID_BT2_#004,"[Marth]

[Marth] 
Now, raise your chin. You are not alone 
anymore. Remember that, and triumph!"

[Marth] 
Excellent. I could sense the power of your hope 
and your strength as warriors."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Marth] 
As I fought, I was reminded of an old friend."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Marth] 
I first met the Divine Dragon Tiki in the midst 
of battle. Much like this."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Alear] 
It's incredible that your world has a Divine 
Dragon in it too."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Marth] 
Yes. Like you, she fought for us humans."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Marth] 
Tiki was placed into a very long sleep in a 
temple where she would be kept safe."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Marth] 
She woke and was incredibly lonely. Once we 
met, she said she wanted to stay with us."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Marth] 
She called me ""Mar-Mar,"" like a kid sister might. 
Human or dragon, we became friends for life."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Alear] 
Then she and I have something in common 
besides our species─you."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
Marth, who fights to end people's suffering. 
Like her, I'm happy to be close to such a hero."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Marth] 
Since our first meeting, I have felt the same."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Alear] 
I'm grateful to you. I've become stronger 
because you are with me."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Alear] 
Having my friends by my side is what makes 
everything possible. I couldn't do this alone."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Marth] 
Then you understand. We will follow you 
always."

[Marth] 
I'd hate to embarrass myself fighting you, so 
don't expect this to be easy."

[Marth] 
I have been waiting for you. Do you believe 
you can best me?"
MID_LC1_#001,

[Marth] 
Odd. This looks very similar to Altea Castle."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Alear] 
Altea Castle. Is that a place in your world?"
MID_OP1_#003,"[Marth] 
That's right. It's where I grew up. After it fell 
into enemy hands, my allies and I took it back."
MID_OP1_#004,"[Alear] 
You lost your home?"
MID_OP1_#005,"[Marth] 
The Dolhr Empire, led by the Shadow Dragon 
Medeus, attacked. His forces overran the castle."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Marth] 
The castle knights offered protection, and many 
soldiers fell while aiding my escape."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Marth] 
On that day, I learned the true meaning 
of powerlessness."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Marth] 
Allies, like Princess Caeda and the mercenary 
Ogma, helped me retake my homeland."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Marth] 
My people call me the Hero-King, but I think the 
real heroes are those who helped me to win."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Marth] 
That's why I fight─for all those who believed 
in me. I want to deliver on their hope."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Alear] 
I...think I know what you mean."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Alear] 
I want a future of peace with my friends and 
allies. That vision pushes me to be my best."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Marth] 
You have grown strong in your battles and are 
more than worthy of their faith in you."
MID_OP1_#014,"[Marth] 
Now they stand beside you, ready to share your 
burden. Your struggles are not yours alone."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Alear] 
My friends and family have brought me all this 
way. I owe them so much."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Marth] 
Keep those feelings close to your heart, and you 
are certain to overcome this trial."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Alear] 
Trial?"
MID_OP1_#018,"[Marth] 
Battle me now, . This is the trial 
bestowed upon you."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Marth] 
Best me in combat to strengthen our bond. 
Win, and you will draw more power from me."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Alear] 
Let the battle begin. I'll show you I can 
overcome this or any trial!"
