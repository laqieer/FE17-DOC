[Veyle] 
Look at these flower petals here. How strange. 
It's almost like Seadall's fortune said."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Seadall] 1 

[Seadall] 
Under a full moon, gather petals glowing gold. 
Then comes true a wish so bold."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
The flowers you have there... I see you 
remembered my fortune."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
But the flower petals are white, not gold."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Seadall] 
Are they? Hold them up to the full moon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Veyle] 
Hm? Like this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
Oh, how lovely! They're shining gold."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Seadall] 
Those flowers only bloom on the night of a 
full moon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Seadall] 
The petals appear white but then shimmer gold 
when the moonlight strikes them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Veyle] 
They're so pretty!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Seadall] 
Their fragrance is thought to have a soothing 
power as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Seadall] 
I'd be happy if they could ease your pain even a 
little, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Veyle] 
Thank you, Seadall. You went to a lot of 
trouble to do this for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Seadall] 
I don't know what you mean."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Veyle] 
Don't be silly. You put together this whole 
beautiful act just for me, didn't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Seadall] 
I assure you I had nothing to do with it. Also... 
A fortune-teller never reveals his secrets."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Veyle] 
Oh, please..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Seadall] 
Now, I've repaid the favor."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Veyle] 
What favor?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Seadall] 
Thanks to your kind gesture before, my fortune- 
telling skills are back and as sharp as ever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Veyle] 
That's wonderful. I'm very happy for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Veyle] 
You know, Seadall, the moon is pretty tonight, 
isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Seadall] 
It is. Very. I don't think I'll ever forget how 
beautiful it looks tonight."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Veyle] 
No. I don't think I will either."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Veyle] 
Under a full moon, gather petals glowing gold. 
Then comes true a wish so bold."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Veyle] 
My wish is to bring peace and happiness to this 
world. And also..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Veyle] 
I wish for your happiness too, Seadall."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Seadall] 
Sorry, did you say something?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Veyle] 
No. I'm sure you're just hearing the sound of 
flowers blooming in the night."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Seadall! Your fortune the other day. It was right!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Veyle] 
I did what you said. I went to the market and 
pretended to be a cat. That is, I meowed a lot."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Seadall] 
Really? But I told you to ignore my reading."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Veyle] 
I thought I'd give it a try. You know, just for fun. 
But then, something amazing happened."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Veyle] 
I meowed and meowed, and I sounded so much 
like a cat, all the mice fled from the market."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Veyle] 
It made everyone at the market very happy...so 
happy, they gave me tasty treats to say thanks!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Veyle] 
It was all so exciting that suddenly I wasn't the 
least bit tired anymore. Your fortune was right!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Seadall] 
Really? It felt so...off when I said it. But if it was 
right on the mark, then...I'm back."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Seadall] 
Though, I don't think I'll be spreading that bit 
of news around."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Veyle] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Seadall] 
You're very kind, Lady Veyle. You really are."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Seadall] 
I lose my confidence, and you go and make up 
this adorable story just to cheer me up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Seadall] 
And it has cheered me up, so thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Veyle] 
Don't say that. I'm telling the truth! I really am!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Veyle] 
I will be very mad if you don't believe me!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Seadall] 
OK, OK. If it's going to be like that, then... 
I believe you. Satisfied?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Seadall] 
Now, since I've done as you asked and believed 
your story, allow me to read your fortune again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Veyle] 
If that's what you want, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Seadall] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Seadall] 
All is revealed. Under a full moon, gather petals 
glowing gold. Then comes true a wish so bold."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Veyle] 
Gather flower petals...that are golden and 
glowing...when there's a full moon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Veyle] 
How strange. I don't really understand what it 
means, but I guess I can try."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Seadall, I've heard you're really good at 
telling fortunes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Seadall] 
I am."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Seadall] 
Or I guess I should say...I was."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Veyle] 
Oh. Does that mean you're...not good at 
it anymore?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Seadall] 
Well, I guess I'd say I'm in a bit of a rut at 
the moment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Veyle] 
Hm. I didn't realize fortune-tellers could get 
""in a rut."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Seadall] 
It would seem so. Sometimes you just don't 
feel it, and it shows in your readings."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Veyle] 
I see. Well, I was thinking of asking you to tell 
my fortune."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Seadall] 
Is something troubling you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Veyle] 
Sort of. I've been very tired lately. I was hoping 
there might be some special way to fix it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Seadall] 
I see. I'm afraid I can't be of much help 
right now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
Is there anything you can do to get your 
fortune-telling powers back?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Seadall] 
I don't really know. I think I just have to wait 
for it to come back when it's ready."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Veyle] 
Well, how about you tell my fortune anyway? 
I won't mind if you get it wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Seadall] 
What? But why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Veyle] 
Humor me. I'll just assume your reading 
is incorrect."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Seadall] 
If that's what you want. Let's begin..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Seadall] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Seadall] 
All is revealed. Go to the market and act like a 
cat. Good fortune shall be given you back."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Veyle] 
Act like a cat...in the market? That's a little bit 
strange, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Seadall] 
Definitely strange. I told you I'm all out of sorts. 
Just pay it no mind. It won't come true."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Veyle] 
Hehe, if you say so."
