So our promise to rebuild Elyos together─our 
plan to see the world─none of that is possible?"
MID_OP2_#031,"[Marth] 
I'm so sorry, ."
MID_OP2_#032,"[Alear] 
There's no need to apologize."
MID_OP2_#033,I've asked so much of you... Too much.
MID_OP2_#034,"But when I thought about a future with you by 
my side...I felt truly happy."
MID_OP2_#035,"[Marth] 
There is a promise I can still keep."
MID_OP2_#036,"In Lythos, the day you awoke... What did I say 
when you summoned me?"
MID_OP2_#037,"""Your ally, until the very end."""
MID_OP2_#038,"[Alear] 
I remember."
MID_OP2_#039,"[Marth] 
I will never break that promise. Until this war's 
end─until my own─I will stay by your side."
MID_OP2_#040,"[Alear] 
You're so kind, Marth. You have always been 
so kind."
MID_OP2_#041,"[Marth] 
You are too. That's why we've made it this far."
MID_OP2_#042,"More than your strength, it's your care for 
others that has brought us all here."
MID_OP2_#043,"[Alear] 
Thank you."
MID_OP2_#044,"[Marth] 
Now, prepare yourself. We'll arrive at the 
portal soon."
MID_OP2_#045,"[Alear] 
I'm ready."
MID_OP3_#001,"[Alear] 2 
[Veyle] 4 

[Alear] 
So this is the portal to other worlds..."
MID_OP3_#002,"[Veyle] 
It's beautiful, but...very cold."
MID_OP3_#003,"[Sombron] 1 

[Sombron] 
You two. Here."
MID_OP3_#004,"[Alear] 
Sombron!"
MID_OP3_#005,"[Veyle] 
Papa..."
MID_OP3_#006,"[Sombron] 
I did not expect you to survive, let alone reach 
me here."
MID_OP3_#007,"[Alear] 
We've come to stop you from destroying Elyos."
MID_OP3_#008,"[Sombron] 
I am done with your worthless world. Return 
to it, and shut the portal. Live in peace there."
MID_OP3_#009,"You stay in your world. I now leave for 
other ones. That should satisfy us both."
MID_OP3_#010,"[Alear] 
You're going to return and attack Elyos again. 
We'll never believe you wouldn't!"
MID_OP3_#011,"And you've caused too much suffering─too 
much loss─to run free."
MID_OP3_#012,"We will defeat you right now, and prevent you 
from invading any other worlds."
MID_OP3_#013,"[Sombron] 
Hmph. Invading other worlds. You think my 
desire is so simple?"
MID_OP3_#014,"[Alear] 
Am I wrong?"
MID_OP3_#015,"[Sombron] 
Invasion is merely a means to an end. What I 
seek is a reunion."
MID_OP3_#016,A reunion with Zero Emblem.
MID_OP3_#017,"[Alear] 
Zero Emblem?"
MID_OP3_#018,"[Marth] 3 
[Marth] 
I've not heard word of this before."
MID_OP3_#019,"[Sombron] 
Of course not. That Emblem is not of 
your world."
MID_OP3_#020,Nor am I.
MID_OP3_#021,"[Alear] 
What do you mean?"
MID_OP3_#022,"[Sombron] 
Beyond this portal lie infinite worlds. One of 
them was my home."
MID_OP3_#023,"It had its own Emblem Rings, and a war arose 
to control them."
MID_OP3_#024,"My kind lost. The enemy used the rings' power 
to slaughter my relatives."
MID_OP3_#025,"All of them. I was very young... Our enemies 
granted me alone the mercy of exile."
MID_OP3_#026,"[Marth] 
You mean...they sent you to Elyos."
MID_OP3_#027,"[Sombron] 
A peaceful world, ruled by godlike dragons. 
I was meant to live a quiet life there."
MID_OP3_#028,"But I brought something with me, unknown 
to them. A single Emblem Ring."
MID_OP3_#029,"[Alear] 
Zero Emblem."
MID_OP3_#030,"[Sombron] 
In my world, known as the Emblem of 
Foundations. With my power, unable to speak."
MID_OP3_#031,"Legend said this Emblem fought without aid. 
So much ambition, and no allies."
MID_OP3_#032,"That story showed me the way forward in my 
complete isolation."
MID_OP3_#033,"I was trapped in this world without friends or 
family. Only that Emblem gave me comfort."
MID_OP3_#034,"[Marth] 
Whoever it was must have been mighty indeed."
MID_OP3_#035,"An Emblem should not be able to survive 
traveling from one world to another."
MID_OP3_#036,"To stay in form in a new world, even for 
moments... I've never heard of such power."
MID_OP3_#037,"[Alear] 
Now you want a reunion. So that Emblem 
is gone."
MID_OP3_#038,"[Sombron] 
Exactly─and all because of villagers that found 
me a few years after I arrived."
MID_OP3_#039,"They mistook me for an abandoned child. They 
pitied me─my first connection in your world."
MID_OP3_#040,"Soon after, the Emblem deserted me, leaving 
only the ring behind."
MID_OP3_#041,"And why? For bonding with the people of this 
world. I despaired, and then..."
MID_OP3_#042,I reduced their village to ash.
MID_OP3_#043,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_OP3_#044,"[Sombron] 
I swore to forgo all bonds in pursuit of my 
ambitions, as my Emblem had."
MID_OP3_#045,"I fought alone, confided in none, preparing to 
return to my world. To exact revenge."
MID_OP3_#046,"I needed pawns for my plan─and territory. 
I spent years amassing it all. Then, I attacked."
MID_OP3_#047,"[Alear] 
So, the war a thousand years ago... That's what 
it was about?"
MID_OP3_#048,"[Veyle] 
But, Papa, you weren't alone in this world."
MID_OP3_#049,"Mama loved you deeply. Your believers, your 
attendants...my siblings..."
MID_OP3_#050,"Zephia, Griss, Marni, Mauvier... My brother 
and me! Everything we did was for you!"
MID_OP3_#050_F,"Zephia, Griss, Marni, Mauvier... My sister 
and me! Everything we did was for you!"
MID_OP3_#051,"[Sombron] 
As I said, pawns. Acting on my command and 
mine alone."
MID_OP3_#052,"Meant to be used and discarded. Deaths which 
mean nothing."
MID_OP3_#053,"[Veyle] 
That's why you killed them all... But what about 
us? You wanted us to die?"
MID_OP3_#054,"[Sombron] 
You were no different to me."
MID_OP3_#055,"[Veyle] 
How...horrible."
MID_OP3_#056,"[Alear] 
You can't be right about your Emblem. You 
weren't left behind."
MID_OP3_#057,"[Sombron] 
What?"
MID_OP3_#058,"[Alear] 
A solitary warrior like that Emblem would know 
how hard it is to be alone."
MID_OP3_#059,"And...would stay by your side, sparing you that 
loneliness in exile."
MID_OP3_#060,"Until you weren't alone, and had new people 
in your life. Until you were OK."
MID_OP3_#061,"Don't you think, more than anyone, a true friend 
like that wanted you to have those connections?"
MID_OP3_#062,"[Sombron] 
You know nothing─nothing at all about 
my Emblem."
MID_OP3_#063,"[Alear] 
That's true. But if your Emblem disappeared 
without a word..."
MID_OP3_#064,Then you don't either. No one does.
MID_OP3_#065,"[Sombron] 
All the more reason to be reunited! I will scour 
world after world!"
MID_OP3_#066,"[Marth] 
Sombron. The Emblem of Foundations is 
no more."
MID_OP3_#067,"You can search and search─but there's 
no point."
MID_OP3_#068,"You might meet the original hero. But Emblems 
are not the same beings─we are not them."
MID_OP3_#069,"You will never be reunited with your Emblem─ 
ever again."
MID_OP3_#070,"[Sombron] 
Be silent."
MID_OP3_#071,"[Alear] 
I can only imagine how much resentment you 
feel. But to sacrifice so many others..."
MID_OP3_#072,"To be so selfish you'd destroy the world? Kill 
your own children?! It's all just so...wrong."
MID_OP3_#073,"[Sombron] 
I said, be silent! You are speaking of things you 
do not understand!"
MID_OP3_#074,"If not for my Emblem I would have died 
powerless. Small."
MID_OP3_#075,"That Emblem had the strength to stand alone! 
Unlike you, huddled together, whining like dogs."
MID_OP3_#076,"Such a warrior showed me the meaning of all 
existence─fight alone, take revenge!"
MID_OP3_#077,"[Marth] 
You're wrong. That's impossible. No Emblem 
wants to see a world destroyed."
MID_OP3_#078,"We aid people through our bonds with the 
Divine Dragons. We are a force for good!"
MID_OP3_#079,"We would never choose to let our power be 
exploited for evil."
MID_OP3_#080,"[Sombron] 
Enough of this nonsense! I won't let you 
stop me─or sway my intentions."
MID_OP3_#081,"I have striven for this for thousands of years. 
If you intend to stand in my way, you will die."
MID_OP3_#082,"[Alear] 
This is it. Prepare for battle, everyone!"

You dare turn your blade on me? You dare interfere 
with that which I have sought for so long?"
MID_OP4_#002,"Such fatal hubris. You will pay for that accordingly. 
Witness how fragile your bonds really are!"
MID_OP4_#003,"[Marth]

Huh?!"
MID_OP4_#005,"[Veyle]

MID_OP4_#006,"[Sombron] 
I am sealing off the portal back to your world. It's what 
I should have done the moment you arrived here."

lost in the distortion between dimensions forevermore."

of moments, the portal will be shut for good."
MID_OP4_#015,"Take comfort. For I shall inflict no further harm 
upon your world."

anguish, far from home."
