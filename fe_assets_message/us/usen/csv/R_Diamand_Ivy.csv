[Ivy] 
Prince Diamant, I have something to show you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Diamant] 
Is the gem in this necklace the one I gave you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
Yes. I decided to make it into something I can 
wear every day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Diamant] 
Well done. It's quite stunning."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Ivy] 
We don't have materials like this in Elusia, but 
we do have skill in craftsmanship."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Ivy] 
Perhaps this is a symbol of the way forward for 
us─Brodian resourcefulness, Elusian talent."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Ivy] 
A path to peace and prosperity based on 
respect for one another's gifts."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Diamant] 
I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Ivy] 
This gift, the gem, really has made me braver."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Ivy] 
Where else could I have gotten the courage to 
reimagine our entire relationship?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Diamant] 
Thank you, Princess Ivy...and I say that as a 
crown prince of Brodia this time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Ivy] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Diamant] 
Convincing Brodia to change its warmongering 
ways will be a battle of its own."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Diamant] 
War leads to profits, which lead to wars, which 
lead to further profits... It's a horrible cycle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Diamant] 
That cycle cannot continue. And I'm the only 
one who can stop it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Diamant] 
This necklace is a perfect symbol of our shared 
goal. Both of our kingdoms intertwined..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Diamant] 
So thank you. I promise you here and now that, 
under my rule, Brodia will champion peace."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Ivy] 
Thank you, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Ivy] 
I will take your words to heart and share them 
with my people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Ivy] 
With the two of us as role models, our kingdoms 
can stop fighting. We can open trade relations."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Ivy] 
Elusia's craftspeople will certainly benefit from 
access to Brodia's resources."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Diamant] 
If that leads to more goods like this necklace, 
both kingdoms will prosper."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Diamant] 
It's a good plan."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Ivy] 
Now we just need to bring it to fruition."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Diamant] 
And we will. We'll make sure of that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Diamant] 
Let's shake on it as leaders and friends. A new 
era of peace begins right here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Ivy] 
Gladly. Let this be the dawn of a new day 
between us."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1

[Ivy] 
Prince Diamant, I wanted to apologize 
for earlier."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Diamant] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Ivy] 
I failed to thank you properly─both for your 
discretion and for the gem you gave me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Ivy] 
Please let me make amends by expressing 
my gratitude now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Ivy] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Diamant] 
Oh, please don't worry about that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Diamant] 
Brodia has a lot to answer for. Offering a token 
like that gem is the least I can do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Ivy] 
It's true. Brodia has invaded our lands 
many times."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Ivy] 
I often wonder how my people would have fared 
without that suffering and bloodshed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Diamant] 
I'm not surprised. That's why you don't owe me 
any gratitude. I hope you understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Ivy] 
But you stepped in to help me, one person to 
another, in accordance with your values."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Diamant] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Ivy] 
That is why, in accordance with my values, 
I want to thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Diamant] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Diamant] 
If that's how you truly feel, Princess Ivy, then 
I accept your gratitude."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Ivy] 
It's all too easy for one individual to give 
a simple thank-you to another."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Ivy] 
Apologies are much the same. It is when 
kingdoms are involved that it gets complicated."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Diamant] 
That's true."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Diamant] 
My father was focused on our kingdom's affairs 
when he began expanding our territory by force."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Diamant] 
That singular focus is how things have always 
been done in Brodia...but that needs to change."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Ivy] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Diamant] 
My father is no longer here, but his influence 
remains. Change will take time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Diamant] 
If there's an easier way, I haven't found it yet. 
I often wonder if I'm ready to be king."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Ivy] 
I know exactly how you feel."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Diamant] 
Ah. I apologize. I didn't mean to unload like that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Ivy] 
No, I understand. I'm actually relieved to hear 
that you have the same concerns I do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Ivy] 
I am much more hopeful now for that future 
when you and I are king and queen."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Ivy] 2 

[Ivy] 
Is someone there?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Ivy] 
No one? Or...a ghost?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Ivy] 
Please don't be a ghost. Please don't be 
a ghost."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
Princess Ivy?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Ivy] 
Aaah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Diamant] 
It's OK. You're safe─I promise. Those shadows 
in the brush are just that, simple shadows."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Ivy] 
I was...actually jumping at shadows?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
You're right. Not a ghost to be seen."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Diamant] 
It isn't like you to misread foliage as an active 
threat. Is everything OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Ivy] 
Please don't tell anyone about this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Ivy] 
It cannot get out that the future ruler of Elusia 
was frightened by mere shrubbery."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Ivy] 
Or even worse, that the prince of Brodia had to 
come to her rescue."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Diamant] 
Believe me─I understand. I won't say a word."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Ivy] 
I am in your debt."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Diamant] 
It seems you've been dealing with this fear for 
a while..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Diamant] 
Here, Princess Ivy. I'd like for you to have this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Ivy] 
What is it? Some kind of...crystal?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Diamant] 
It's a gem from one of Brodia's mines. It's said 
to bring courage to those who need it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Diamant] 
Keep it as a good-luck charm. Then you won't 
have anything to be afraid of."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Ivy] 
Charity from Brodia is not going to do 
my royal image any favors..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Diamant] 
Don't think of it as a tether to Brodia. This is 
just a simple gift from me to you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Diamant] 
If it truly makes you uncomfortable, you don't 
have to keep it. I won't mind. Farewell."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025,"[Diamant] 

[Ivy] 
Thank you, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026,"[Ivy] 
I didn't know such treasures could be found 
in Brodia."
