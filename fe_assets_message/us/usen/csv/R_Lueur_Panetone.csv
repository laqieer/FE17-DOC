[Panette] 
Aw, damn. I guess it won't be so easy to find 
them after all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
Panette? You're up late."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Panette] 
Ah! Good evening, Divine One!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
What's that letter you're reading?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Panette] 
I employed a Solmic investigator to find my 
parents. This is her report."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Panette] 
Alas, it seems the search has come up empty."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
Huh. I thought you said your parents were 
horrible people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Panette] 
Yes, well... Our conversation made me realize 
I have some feelings in need of resolution."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Panette] 
I thought perhaps now, with the benefits of 
time, I could speak to them with a cooler head."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Panette] 
Thus my desire to track them down...assuming 
they are still alive, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
I'm impressed. It's brave of you to try facing 
them after all these years."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
Panette, how about I help find your parents?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Panette] 
No, no... I would not dream of such 
an imposition!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alear] 
It's the least I can do to repay you for 
your training."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
Besides, we've seen our share of dangerous 
battles together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
You, me, the others─we have a connection. 
We help each other. Let me help you, please."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Panette] 
Very well, then. I will gratefully accept your aid."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Panette] 
Truth be told, even if we do not find my 
parents, I have already found my family."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Panette] 
What more do I truly need?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Panette] 
In a brawl, the most crucial blow is the first. 
Victory oft rests on attacking before your foe."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Panette] 
Thus, you must be agile─agile enough to strike 
with a raptor's swiftness!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
Be agile. Got it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Panette] 
That way, even if your enemies do attack first, 
you will be able to evade their fists."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
Makes sense..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Panette] 
Is something the matter, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
I'm just surprised that a noblewoman like you 
knows so much about brawling."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Panette] 
I suppose there is no need to obscure the truth. 
The woman standing before you is not a noble."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Panette] 
Why, in time past, she was quite wild indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
Really?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Panette] 
Yes. My parents were awful─gallivanting about 
with nary a thought for their children."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Panette] 
So I fled. Before the princess appointed me, 
I lived a roaming, solitary life."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Panette] 
It was then that I learned how to fistfight."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry you had to endure all of that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Panette] 
Sorry? If not for running away from that 
wretched home, I would hardly be who I am."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
I see. Well... Would you like to tell me more 
about your past?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I think it might help me to hear about your life 
before you met Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Panette] 
Why, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Panette] 
If my stories of woe can help you, I would be 
all too happy to share them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Panette] 
HYAAA!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
That was incredible!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Panette] 
Yes. Learn to strike with that much force and 
you are sure to trounce all comers."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Panette] 
In truth, I was rather surprised when you asked 
me for lessons in brawling."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Panette] 
I take it you wish to give someone a forceful 
talking-to. A debtor, perhaps?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alear] 
What? No, nothing like that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
I figure that I could lose my weapon when I'm 
in battle or get ambushed when I'm not."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
Just in case, it's best I learn how to hold my 
own in physical combat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Panette] 
I see. That is quite shrewd, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Panette] 
Very well. I shall instruct you in the ancient art 
of the fisticuffs."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Panette] 
How to hone an indomitable spirit. How to 
repel foes with a mere scowl."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Panette] 
There is much I can teach you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
I see. Well, I'm ready to learn!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Panette] 
Good. I will make you into the most fearsome of 
scrappers. Let us begin!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Panette] 2 

[Alear] 
No word on your missing parents today, I take 
it? Don't lose hope yet. We'll keep looking."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Panette] 
Divine One... I have come to the conclusion that 
it is time to abandon the search for my parents."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
But...why?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Panette] 
It is regrettable, but we have searched high 
and low. There is nothing more to be done."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Panette] 
That said, I thank you, sincerely. You have been 
a steadfast companion throughout."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Panette] 
Searching for my parents with you has been... 
enjoyable. I hope we can continue on together."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
If that's what you want, Panette, then yes, 
I would like to continue on with you. Always."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Panette] 
I─ I don't understand..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
I told you before we had a connection, but it's 
more than that. I mean, I want us to be more."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
Please, take this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Panette] 
That's...the Pact Ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
You're supposed to give it to someone you 
care for deeply. For me, that's you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Panette] 
Divine One...I─ I cannot."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Panette] 
My parents were once wildly happy with one 
another. But in time, their relationship soured."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Panette] 
People's feelings change. I cannot bear the 
thought of that happening to us."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
That was your past, Panette. You have a whole 
future ahead of you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
Everyone has their ups and downs. You and 
I too─good times and otherwise."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
But you have the agility of a raptor, and now 
so do I. We can evade anything together."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Panette] 
Haha! Over and over again, you astonish me, 
Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Panette] 
I see I've impressed upon you the importance of 
agility. But what of the rest of the brawler's art?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
Nothing to do with us. So, what do you think? 
Will you accept this ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Panette] 
Yes. I will, gladly."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Panette] 
Stay with me, from now until 
forever, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Of course. I am your partner and you are mine."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Panette] 
I like the sound of that."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Panette] 
I can think of no one I'd rather fight beside. 
You are the one I truly adore."
