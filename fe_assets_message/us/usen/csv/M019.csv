MID_ED1_#003,"[Marni] 
I can't go back! I'm just gonna get an earful 
from Lord Sombron. Or worse...Zephia!"
MID_ED1_#004,"[Mauvier] 
And after all your nonsense about being exempt 
from scolding. Now, let's hurry to Lady Veyle."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Wait, tell me! Is Veyle all right?"
MID_ED1_#006,"[Mauvier] 
Lord Sombron has given Zephia a new kind of 
magic to use on Lady Veyle. If she does..."
MID_ED1_#007,the true Lady Veyle will never awaken again.
MID_ED1_#008,"[Alear]

MID_ED1_#009,"[Mauvier] 
The others think this is a happy outcome. But 
I... I have always worried for her safety."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
You really do want to protect her, don't you?"
MID_ED1_#011,"[Mauvier] 
I have said too much. Marni, I am returning now, 
with or without you."

Is it a good idea to just let them go?"

We took back the rings. Besides..."

him right at her side."

I never lost faith that we would return to you. 
Thank you, ."
MID_ED2_#003,"On the Shadowy Moor, and at Florra Port, it 
pained me to fight against you."
MID_ED2_#004,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry for putting you through that. I promise 
to never let that happen again."
MID_ED2_#005,"I can't believe there are so many of the 
Corrupted in Elusia..."
MID_ED2_#006,"[Roy] 
The Fell Dragon is behind the rise of the 
Corrupted in this kingdom."
MID_ED2_#007,"Sovereign blood is no longer enough for him. 
He's abducting the people of Elusia."
MID_ED2_#008,"When Sombron drains them, they turn into the 
Corrupted. That's why they're everywhere."
MID_ED2_#009,"[Alear] 
You mean the Corrupted we killed were..."

MID_ED2_#011,"Solm, Brodia, Firene─they'll all suffer if the 
Corrupted leave my kingdom. We must act now."
MID_ED2_#012,"If any of my people still remain, I must do all 
I can to save them."
MID_ED2_#013,"[Alear] 
Those two came all the way here to stop us 
from reaching Elusia Castle."
MID_ED2_#014,"The Four Hounds must be desperate to keep 
us at bay. Let's find out why."

Why'd the Divine Dragon dock here? The place 
is infested."

Sombron go?"
MID_OP1_#003,"[Griss] 
Bet he was mad we lost the rings, huh?"
MID_OP1_#004,"[Zephia] 
Very."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Griss] 
Ahaha, knew it! So, he's gonna punish us, 
right? Finally, yes!"
MID_OP1_#006,"[Zephia] 
In fact, no. It was a scolding, nothing more. 
He impressed upon me the gravity of our role."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Marni] 
That's all? Hah! He must really love us."
MID_OP1_#008,Feels good to be appreciated!
MID_OP1_#009,"[Zephia] 
Has Lady Veyle woken up yet?"
MID_OP1_#010,"[Mauvier] 
No. That spell you keep casting on her... 
This is getting reckless."
MID_OP1_#011,"We should dispense with the magic for now. 
Allow her to return to normal."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Zephia] 
The spell will soon have a more stable effect. 
Lord Sombron gave me an enchanted helmet."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Mauvier] 
What?"
MID_OP1_#014,"[Zephia] 
For her to wear. A helmet imbued with his 
power that will amplify the spell I cast on her."
MID_OP1_#015,"Finally, I can erase the defect from existence. 
I intend to use it shortly."
MID_OP1_#016,"I would like to have some good news for my 
next meeting with Lord Sombron."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Griss] 
Speaking of news, our warships ran into the 
Divine Dragon's forces."
MID_OP1_#018,"No luck stopping 'em. Sounds like they're 
sailing to Elusia as we speak."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Zephia] 
Huh... Moving faster than I expected."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Griss] 
Yeah. Only a matter of time before they're 
knocking at our door."
MID_OP1_#021,"[Marni] 
Ooo! Want me to buy us some time? I can do it!"
MID_OP1_#022,"[Zephia] 
Of course, dear. So good of you to volunteer. 
But I can't have you going all alone."
MID_OP1_#023,"Mauvier. You'll accompany her, won't you?"
MID_OP1_#024,"[Mauvier] 4 
[Mauvier] 
Very well."
MID_OP1_#025,"[Marni] 
What? Why? I'd be fine on my own!"
MID_OP1_#026,"[Zephia] 
You are good, of course. But you'd achieve 
even greater success with Mauvier at your side."
MID_OP1_#027,"[Marni] 
Well, OK! All the more praise for me then, right?"
MID_OP1_#028,"[Mauvier] 
Zephia, I ask one thing. Wait to cast your spell 
on Veyle again until we return."
MID_OP1_#029,"[Zephia] 
All right, Mauvier."
MID_OP1_#030,"[Mauvier] 
Then we depart."
MID_OP1_#031,"[Marni] 
We'll be back before you know it!"
MID_OP1_#032,"[Mauvier]

[Zephia] 
Hmm..."
MID_OP1_#033,"[Griss] 
Ugh, Mauvier. He's way too attached to that 
other Veyle."
MID_OP1_#034,"[Zephia] 
Truly. But it doesn't matter at the moment. 
And won't, as long as he stays in his place."
MID_OP1_#035,"The Four Hounds are my family. I will always 
love Mauvier. Always. As long as he obeys."
MID_OP1_#036,"Now, we have a serious matter to discuss─what 
Lady Veyle said about having a sibling..."
MID_OP1_#037,"[Griss] 
Right, right... That dragonstone of hers─ 
something about it being whole, not broken."
MID_OP1_#038,"[Zephia] 
Yes, exactly. We need to look into that. 
The situation bears...examination."

people. Why is it so quiet?"

responsibility to help them."

people to save."

be lost elsewhere."

best for everyone."
