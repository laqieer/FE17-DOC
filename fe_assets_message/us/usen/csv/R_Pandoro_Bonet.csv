[Pandreo] 
Hey, Bunet! What did you think of the party? 
Pretty fun, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Oof. That bad, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Bunet] 
Forgive me... The noise was overwhelming. 
My head is still spinning."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, I see. That's probably my fault."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Bunet] 
I will say, everyone was in high spirits. Even in 
times like these, good cheer abounded."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Pandreo] 
That's the magic of a good shindig! But how 
about you? Learn anything?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Bunet] 
Certainly. I came away with many insights."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Bunet] 
I noticed that you spent most of the time simply 
listening to people share their troubles."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Well, sure! My parties aren't all about me. 
I want to help people feel better, you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Pandreo] 
After all, though I may look like a run-of-the-mill 
scoundrel, I am a man of the cloth!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Bunet] 
Yes... Now I see the error I made. I wanted my 
cooking to steal the show."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Bunet] 
But good party food lets the conversation take 
center stage."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Bunet] 
Headache aside, I'm glad I went. Next time I will 
cook the perfect dish for you and your guests."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Pandreo] 
That would be great! Thanks, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Pandreo] 
And hey, let me know if there's anything I can 
do to help. Anything at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Bunet] 
Well, there is one thing you can do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Bunet] 
Let me give you one little lick."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Pandreo] 
One little WHAT?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Pandreo] 
Um. Uh, you're kidding, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Bunet] 
No. I'm quite serious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Bunet] 
I must understand your festive spirit in order to 
capture it in my cooking."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Bunet] 
Now, roll up your sleeve. It'll be quick. No need 
to be nervous."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Pandreo] 
Uh... Hehe..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Bunet] 
Pandreo? Is something the matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Pandreo] 
I've been to some wild parties in my day, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Pandreo] 
That's a bit too far, even for me!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Bunet] 
Pandreo, how was the party?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Bunet] 
Did the critic appreciate my cooking?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, uh, yeah. She was very impressed, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Bunet] 
But?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Pandreo] 
Well, to be honest, it wasn't that popular with 
anyone else."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Bunet] 
What? But I sampled it myself. The flavor 
was heavenly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, don't get me wrong. It tasted great."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Pandreo] 
It was just a little too...gourmet. Party food's 
gotta be easy to pick up and walk around with."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Bunet] 
What?! Why?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Pandreo] 
You know, people like to mingle while they eat. 
This felt like a stuffy dinner at the royal court."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Pandreo] 
I should have said something. I-I know you 
haven't been to many parties, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Bunet] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Don't beat yourself up, though. It's not like 
people didn't eat it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Bunet] 
A chef's sacred duty is to make the right food 
for the occasion...and I failed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Bunet] 
I made something far worse than a bad dish. 
I made...the wrong dish."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Pandreo] 
Bunet, it's not like that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Bunet] 
I am your friend and I let you down. A mere 
apology will not suffice. Please, strike me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Pandreo] 
What?! No! You went to so much trouble 
making that food. I'm not gonna hit you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Bunet] 
I ruined your party, and still you find it in your 
heart to forgive me... You are a true friend."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Bunet] 
Pandreo, when is your next get-together?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Pandreo] 
Looking to redeem yourself, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Bunet] 
No. At least, not yet. Before redeeming myself, 
there is something I must do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Bunet] 
I must attend...a party."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Pandreo] 
Whaaat?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Bunet] 
Ah, what a delicious aroma. It smells so fresh 
and so...green."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Yeah, I love the smell of fresh-cut grass!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Phew! Looks like that's the last of the weeds 
in the Somniel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Which means we're done with our Sentinel 
duties for the day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Bunet] 
Does weeding really count as Sentinel duty?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Pandreo] 
Sure, why not? If we do it, that's what it is!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Pandreo] 
Bandits may not come around here, but the 
Somniel still needs protecting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Bunet] 
Hm, yes. We have to defend it from the 
merciless onslaught of...weeds."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Pandreo] 
Oh! Bunet, old pal. Don't forget I'm counting on 
you to make food for the party."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Bunet] 
Leave it to me. As always, I will prepare a 
flawless banquet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Pandreo] 
That's what I like to hear. You're a man among 
men, you know that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Bunet] 
Think nothing of it. I am glad for any chance to 
hone my culinary skills."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, that reminds me. I heard there's gonna be 
a famous food critic there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Bunet] 
Really?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Yeah! It might be a good chance to show her 
what you can do."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Bunet] 
Interesting... In that case, I will prepare an 
innovative new dish for the occasion."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Bunet] 
Something that is sure to set the food critic's 
eyes alight. Be sure to watch for her reaction."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Pandreo] 
Why don't you come see it for yourself?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Bunet] 
I dislike parties. Too noisy, I find. Like a dish 
with many strong flavors all at once."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Pandreo] 
Ah, too bad. I guess that's the price you pay for 
those acute senses of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Bunet] 
Just report back to me afterward. That is all 
I ask."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Pandreo] 
You got it, good buddy! Can't wait to taste the 
grub you whip up!"
