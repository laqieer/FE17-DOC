[Alcryst] 
Seadall? I'd like to apologize once more for our 
conversation the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
I really should have considered your feelings 
before asking about your past..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
It didn't bother me, and you didn't do 
anything wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
I've been thinking about your stories since then."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alcryst] 
I had assumed the caravan lifestyle was all fun 
and games...but that's not true, is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Seadall] 
No. Fun isn't the right word."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Seadall] 
That life can be brutal beyond compare. 
I watched friends die during raids...and worse."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alcryst] 
There must have been so many hardships...and 
yet, I assumed it was a life of leisure."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alcryst] 
If I had looked past my own desires for even a 
moment before speaking... I really am sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Seadall] 
Oh, Prince Alcryst..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Seadall] 
Like I said, you've done nothing wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Seadall] 
Yes, bad things happened when I was traveling 
with the caravan."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Seadall] 
But good things happened too. Many more 
good things."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Seadall] 
The caravan was my family and my home. 
I count myself lucky to have lived that life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alcryst] 
I'm very glad to hear that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Seadall] 
So please, do not hesitate. Ask as many 
questions as you like."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Seadall] 
Ask me about the strange and wonderful foods 
I tasted for the first time at the border village."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Seadall] 
Or about the morning sun I watched set the sky 
on fire as it rose over the desert oasis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Seadall] 
There are so many questions I hope you ask. 
And so many stories I hope to tell you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alcryst] 
Your tales mesmerize me, Seadall. I can't wait 
to get lost in them again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alcryst] 
Please, tell me a new one─and another after 
that! Tell me stories until the break of dawn."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Seadall] 
Haha... With pleasure, Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Alcryst] 
That's amazing! Wolf jousting sounds like a 
thrilling sport to witness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
That it is."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Seadall] 
But it's the fights out in the crowd...hm, that's 
where you'll find the real action."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Seadall] 
There are plenty of ways to amuse oneself in 
Solm, but nothing is quite like the Wolf Arena."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alcryst] 
So many stories... What a fascinating life you've 
led, Seadall."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alcryst] 
Your descriptions are so vivid. I feel as if I've 
witnessed it all with my own eyes!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alcryst] 
The caravan lifestyle sounds like so much fun."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alcryst] 
Coming and going as you please, following your 
own whims and curiosities all over the world."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alcryst] 
No restrictions, no cares...and if you ever grow 
bored, you can just set off on another journey."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alcryst] 
I wish I could have that life..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Seadall] 
Yes, well..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alcryst] 
There's one story you haven't told yet. When 
did you first join the caravan?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alcryst] 
I bet you were born into it. Am I close?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Seadall] 
No. I was born in a town by the sea. 
It was...beautiful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Seadall] 
I was so young when my father died, I have no 
memories of him. My mother raised me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Seadall] 
She was a fortune-teller, but...an ill-fated one. 
She got sick and died when I was young."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Seadall] 
One thing led to another... Before long, I was 
living on the streets."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alcryst] 
On the streets? But why?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Seadall] 
I was a child without a family. Where else 
would I live?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Seadall] 
But one day a caravan was passing by. The 
travelers called to me...invited me to join them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Seadall] 
And I did. I traveled with them from that day on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Seadall] 
Speaking was difficult for me then. Words were 
hard. So my teacher taught me to dance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Seadall] 
I learned that I didn't need words to 
communicate. That saved me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Alcryst] 
I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Seadall] 
Ah, my apologies. That story is not so amusing 
as the others..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Alcryst] 
Please, I'm the one who should apologize. 
I didn't think before broaching the subject."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Seadall] 
No, I've darkened the mood."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029,"[Seadall] 
I'm sorry. I think this is a good place to stop 
for now. Another time, Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Seadall] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Seadall? May I ask you about something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Seadall] 
What would you like to know, Prince Alcryst?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 
I've heard that you were once part of a 
traveling caravan."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Is that true?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Seadall] 
Yes. That's right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Seadall] 
Merchants, performers, dancers... I've traveled 
with them all and many more."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alcryst] 
Really?! That must have been incredible!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Seadall] 
""Incredible""? That's a flattering description. 
I'm surprised you think so."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alcryst] 
Well, I've rarely traveled outside of Brodia. 
My duties as a prince keep me so busy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Seadall] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alcryst] 
I'm also a bit of an introvert... I envy those who 
can navigate foreign cultures with ease."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Seadall] 
The world is full of wonders. The things I've 
seen...some of it would take your breath away."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Seadall] 
In fact, if you're truly interested in that life, 
I could tell you a story or three."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alcryst] 
Really? I would enjoy that very much!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Seadall] 
Of course, if I tell you these tales, I will be 
obliged to leave out some of the best bits."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Seadall] 
I can't be responsible for inspiring a prince to 
go adventuring beyond his kingdom's walls."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alcryst] 
Oh, no need to worry. I'm not that brave. I was 
anxious just asking you a simple question."
