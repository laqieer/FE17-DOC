MID_ED1_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Timerra] 
That takes care of that. Sorry for roping you 
into the scuffle, Divine One."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
That's all right. But I haven't had a chance to 
say why I'm here."
MID_ED1_#003,"I already explained this to Queen Seforia and 
Prince Fogado, but..."
MID_ED1_#004,The Fell Dragon has been released. He's back.
MID_ED1_#005,"[Timerra] 
Hm."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
It's sudden, I know. You're probably shocked."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Timerra] 
I already knew."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Alear] 
You did?"
MID_ED1_#009,"[Timerra] 
Mom and Fogado did too. We've all known for 
a while now."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
Fogado, you too?"
MID_ED1_#011,"[Fogado] 3 

[Fogado] 
Sorry. Truth is, our chance meeting in Tullah 
Desert...wasn't totally by chance."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Alear] 
Were you deceiving us?"
MID_ED1_#013,"[Fogado] 
The opposite, actually. I had to make sure that 
you weren't deceiving us."
MID_ED1_#014,"When the Fell Dragon returned, we had to take 
steps to protect our country."
MID_ED1_#015,"[Timerra] 
I'll lay it out for you."
MID_ED1_#016,"The palace has scouts all over Elyos─keeping 
an eye on the three kingdoms."
MID_ED1_#017,"When Elusia brought back the Fell Dragon, 
we learned about it early on."
MID_ED1_#018,"But we couldn't beat him without the Emblem 
Rings─and we couldn't use them without you."
MID_ED1_#019,Our only option was to focus on defense.
MID_ED1_#020,"The Corrupted started appearing, so we had 
to quickly lay out a plan."
MID_ED1_#021,"[Alear] 
And what was the plan?"
MID_ED1_#022,"[Timerra] 
First off, Mom would stay in the palace. She'd 
work with the royal guard to keep out intruders."
MID_ED1_#023,"And we'd send out our militia, the Sentinels, to 
bolster soldiers' efforts against the Corrupted."
MID_ED1_#024,"[Fogado] 
As captain, my job was to watch out for the 
Corrupted near the Elusian border."
MID_ED1_#025,"If someone claimed to be the Divine Dragon, 
I'd size them up and bring them to the palace."
MID_ED1_#026,"[Alear] 
That's why you hid the fact you're a prince."
MID_ED1_#027,"[Timerra] 
I was in the Sentinels too. And I wandered the 
country, keeping our ring safe."
MID_ED1_#028,"[Alear] 
As part of this plan, did you ever consider 
asking for another country's help?"
MID_ED1_#029,"[Timerra] 
No. Because then we'd have to help them."
MID_ED1_#030,"We can't fight another country's battles. We're 
stretched thin fighting our own."
MID_ED1_#031,"That's how Solm does it. You scratch your own 
back, we'll scratch ours, thank you very much."
MID_ED1_#032,"[Alear] 
I see."
MID_ED1_#033,"[Timerra] 
I'm sorry we misled you. But we did it to 
protect the queendom."
MID_ED1_#034,"[Alear] 
I don't mean to criticize your country's way of 
doing things. I'm just surprised."
MID_ED1_#035,"[Timerra] 
Here's the most important part of the 
plan, though."
MID_ED1_#036,"If you did turn out to be the Divine Dragon, 
we'd give you the Ring of the Radiant Hero..."
MID_ED1_#037,"And then tell you where to find our other 
Emblem Ring."
MID_ED1_#038,"[Alear] 
Solm has a second ring?"
MID_ED1_#039,"[Timerra] 
Yup. The Ring of the Crux of Fate. It's in the─"

Hortensia, princess of Elusia, has breached 
the palace."

Oh... Oh."
MID_ED1_#044,"[Timerra]

what's on the menu first!"
MID_MOVIE1_#003,"Ahem... And now, an exclusive performance 
from the one and only..."
MID_MOVIE1_#004,Timerra!
MID_OP1_#001,"[Seforia] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Seforia] 
Divine One, royals of the three kingdoms... 
Welcome to Solm Palace."
MID_OP1_#002,"I'm Seforia, the queen of Solm."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
It's an honor to meet you, Queen Seforia."
MID_OP1_#004,"[Seforia] 
And you. Really, it's a treat."
MID_OP1_#005,"And a surprise! I never expected Fogado to 
bring the Divine Dragon here."
MID_OP1_#006,"Out of everything he's done on his outings, 
this is the most impressive."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Fogado] 4 

[Fogado] 
I was just doing what any prince would do for 
his queen."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Seforia] 
That's ""Mom"" to you. My son─tries to act so 
cool, so detached."
MID_OP1_#009,"Anyway! Those introductions when you arrived. 
There were...a lot of them."
MID_OP1_#010,"First you, Divine One, and then the Firenese, 
Brodian, and Elusian royalty..."
MID_OP1_#011,"Quite the guest list! I was so overwhelmed, 
I nearly fell off my throne."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Alear] 
You have my apologies. We're here about a 
very important matter."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Seforia] 
Yes, you said. Fell Dragon Sombron's return. 
I had no idea all that was happening."
MID_OP1_#014,"And he created those creatures, hm? That 
explains why they're so vicious."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Alear] 
But your palace hasn't been attacked by 
the Corrupted? Or Elusian forces?"
MID_OP1_#016,"[Seforia] 
Oh, it has. We got rid of them."
MID_OP1_#017,"[Alear] 
I see. You got rid of them..."
MID_OP1_#018,"Wait, really? All of them?"
MID_OP1_#019,"[Seforia] 
You seem surprised."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Alear] 
I'm impressed. But certainly glad no one's 
breached the palace."
MID_OP1_#021,"[Seforia] 
I'm sorry to hear the other countries are having 
a harder time of it. And Queen Lumera..."
MID_OP1_#022,"I visited her in Lythos many times. She was 
always very gracious."
MID_OP1_#023,"Naturally, the queendom of Solm stands with 
you in your war against the Fell Dragon."
MID_OP1_#024,"[Alear] 
Thank you. On that note, I have a request."
MID_OP1_#025,"The Ring of the Radiant Hero, which was 
entrusted to Solm... May I take it?"
MID_OP1_#026,"[Seforia] 
Of course. I'll get it right away."
MID_OP1_#027,Wait... Hmm...
MID_OP1_#028,Where was it again?
MID_OP1_#029,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_OP1_#030,"[Seforia] 
I haven't seen it for a while. Fogado, do you 
know where the ring might be?"
MID_OP1_#031,"[Fogado] 
No clue. Maybe it's in the doodad drawer?"
MID_OP1_#032,"[Fogado] 

[Seforia] 
Hm. Please, wait here a moment."
MID_OP1_#033,"[Alear] 
Oh! OK..."
MID_OP1_#034,"[Seforia] 
[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
The ""doodad drawer."""
MID_OP1_#035,"[Ivy] 
[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
Has it been lying around in a musty cupboard 
this whole time?"
MID_OP1_#036,"[Alfred] 
[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
This is one of the strongest Emblem Rings. 
I... I don't know what to say."
MID_OP1_#037,"[Diamant] 

[Alear] 

[Seforia] 1 

[Fogado] 3 

[Seforia] 
Ah, you know what? I just remembered. Timerra 
took it with her."
MID_OP1_#038,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Timerra?"
MID_OP1_#039,"[Fogado] 
My sister. Also, the crown princess."
MID_OP1_#040,"[Seforia] 
She's set to inherit my crown...and like Fogado, 
she's always out doing who knows what."
MID_OP1_#041,"To be fair, I acted the same when I was young. 
Anyway, she's been gone for days."
MID_OP1_#042,"[Fogado] 
Probably on a camping trip. Oh, that sounds 
great right now."
MID_OP1_#043,"[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
So it's true. The crown princess and prince 
aren't around much."
MID_OP1_#044,"[Alfred] 
[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
And she doesn't know when they'll be back."
MID_OP1_#045,"[Alear] 
We can look for Princess Timerra. Do you have 
any idea where she might be?"
MID_OP1_#046,"[Seforia] 
I think she was heading to the southern desert... 
in which case, she'd set up camp in the oasis."
MID_OP1_#047,"[Alear] 
All right, then. We'll head there."
MID_OP1_#048,"[Seforia] 
You know, a trip to the oasis is just what I need! 
I'll pack my things."
MID_OP1_#049,"[Fogado] 
Actually, Mom, how about you stay put?"
MID_OP1_#050,"[Seforia] 
Oh, all right. You kids go on without me."
MID_OP1_#051,"If you find Timerra, do summon the Emblem, 
will you? I'd love to meet him."
MID_OP1_#052,Be careful. It's already getting dark out.
MID_OP1_#053,"[Fogado] 
Come on, everyone─I'll lead the way!"
MID_OP2_#001,"[Timerra] 2

backup singers, Merrin and Panette!"

We're bandits. Bandits!"

Really in it. Right now!"

Timerra and her friends singing."
MID_OP3_#004,"[Alear] 
Oh... Sorry."
MID_OP3_#005,"[Fogado] 
Haha, don't worry about it. People call them 
the Racket of Solm for a reason."
MID_OP3_#006,"Weird that they stopped. An attack, you think?"

Let's get over there and find out."

MID_OP4_#004,"[Timerra] 
Don't tell me! You're the Divine Dragon, right?"
MID_OP4_#005,"Fogado wouldn't have come here unless he'd 
found you first."
MID_OP4_#006,"[Alear] 
He wouldn't have... What?"
MID_OP4_#007,"[Timerra] 
Not important. We've got bigger steaks to roast. 
Have to deal with these bandits, for a start!"
MID_OP4_#008,"It'd really help if you could use your summoning 
powers on this ring."

I've always wanted to meet the person who 
lives in here. Can you make that happen?"
