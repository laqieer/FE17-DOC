[Alear] 
That's the last of the bandits. You've been a 
huge help, Yunaka."
MID_ED1_#002,"If not for you, we'd be scratching our heads in 
an empty shrine right about now."
MID_ED1_#003,I can't thank you enough.
MID_ED1_#004,"[Yunaka] 
It was nothing, really..."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alfred] 
I wonder who took it from the shrine in the 
first place."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
It must have been those bandits, right?"
MID_ED1_#007,"[Yunaka] 
Uh... Well..."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Alear] 
What's the matter?"
MID_ED1_#009,"[Yunaka] 
I have a...uh...confession. The thing is..."
MID_ED1_#010,I didn't find the ring. I stole it.
MID_ED1_#011,"[Alear] 
Huh?"
MID_ED1_#012,"[Yunaka] 
I was strapped for money, and when I saw the 
shrine, I figured it might have valuables."
MID_ED1_#013,"I went inside, heard Micaiah's voice, and pow, 
there's the ring staring right at me."
MID_ED1_#014,"I was just looking to make a quick bundle 
of dough! I'm sorry."
MID_ED1_#015,"[Alear] 
I see."
MID_ED1_#016,"[Yunaka] 
When I learned that you two were royalty, 
I panicked and kinda, well...lied."
MID_ED1_#017,"Really, I'm no different from those bandits. 
I'll accept whatever punishment you give me."
MID_ED1_#018,"[Alfred] 
Hold on. You were planning to sell the ring?"
MID_ED1_#019,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah..."
MID_ED1_#020,"[Alfred] 
Well then, why didn't you?"
MID_ED1_#021,"You could have run for the hills as soon as the 
Divine Dragon handed it to you."
MID_ED1_#022,"We're useless in the dark. Would've been easy 
to give us the slip."
MID_ED1_#023,"But instead, you stuck around and risked your 
neck for us. Why?"
MID_ED1_#024,"[Yunaka] 
Well...because of Micaiah."
MID_ED1_#025,"When she started talking to me, I got this 
feeling that I just couldn't shake."
MID_ED1_#026,"I felt like...like I had to help her get to the 
Divine Dragon."
MID_ED1_#027,"[Micaiah] 4 
[Micaiah] 
Yunaka has shown me nothing but kindness. 
Fighting by her side, I saw a bright path ahead."
MID_ED1_#028,"When I sensed Sombron's return, I called out in 
the dark. It was she who answered."
MID_ED1_#029,"I am to blame for entangling her in all this. 
Yunaka has done nothing wrong."
MID_ED1_#030,"[Micaiah] 
[Alfred] 
I hear you. But she did lie to us."
MID_ED1_#031,"As prince, I'm not supposed to let that go 
without some sort of punishment."
MID_ED1_#032,"[Yunaka] 
Lay it on me. I can handle it."
MID_ED1_#033,"[Alear] 
How about...joining our forces?"
MID_ED1_#034,"[Yunaka] 
Say what now?"
MID_ED1_#035,"[Alear] 
We're on a journey to collect the Emblem Rings 
and defeat the Fell Dragon."
MID_ED1_#036,"I know it's a lot to ask, but... Will you pledge 
yourself to our cause?"
MID_ED1_#037,"What do you think, Alfred? A fitting 
punishment?"
MID_ED1_#038,"[Alfred] 
I love it. Our army is pretty lean, so adding a 
new recruit makes a lot of sense."
MID_ED1_#039,"And Yunaka clearly has raw talent. She could 
be a real asset."
MID_ED1_#040,"[Yunaka] 
I won't let you down."
MID_ED1_#041,Thank you. Both of you.
MID_ED1_#042,"[Alear] 
Don't mention it. And, Yunaka, allow me to be 
the first to say... Hiya papaya."
MID_ED1_#043,"[Yunaka] 
Uhh... Hehehe!"
MID_ED1_#044,"Hiya papaya back atcha, Divine One!"
MID_ED1_#045,"[Alear] 
With that settled, let's hurry onward. We've 
got to cross into Brodia, right?"
MID_ED1_#046,"[Alfred] 
Yes. Mother sent a letter to the Brodian king 
when we left the castle."
MID_ED1_#047,He should be expecting us.
MID_ED1_#048,"[Alear] 
Good. The kingdom of might... I'm curious to 
see what it's like there."
MID_ED2_#001,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Huh? Is that..."
MID_ED2_#002,Hey!
MID_ED2_#003,"[Veyle] 1

Hm?"
MID_ED2_#004,"[Alear] 
You're the girl I met in Florra Mill Town! 
Veyle, wasn't it?"
MID_ED2_#005,"[Veyle] 
Oh! What a coincidence finding you 
here, ."
MID_ED2_#006,"[Alear] 
I'm glad to see you again. You left so abruptly 
last time─it really caught me off guard."
MID_ED2_#007,Do you live around here?
MID_ED2_#008,"[Veyle] 
No. I'm just passing through. Well, looking for 
someone, really."
MID_ED2_#009,"[Alear] 
Who are you looking for?"
MID_ED2_#010,"[Veyle] 
A person I must talk to again, no matter what. 
My sibling."
MID_ED2_#011,"[Alear] 
You were separated, then... I'm sorry. It's 
painful to be apart from one's family."
MID_ED2_#012,Do you have any idea where to look?
MID_ED2_#013,"[Veyle] 
None. I don't even know what face to look for. 
We've been apart since I was very young."
MID_ED2_#014,But they did give me something long ago─this.
MID_ED2_#015,"[Alear] 
What a pretty stone."
MID_ED2_#016,"[Veyle] 
It's my good-luck charm. I know that as long as 
I have this, we'll be reunited someday."
MID_ED2_#017,"[Alear] 
I'm sure you will."
MID_ED2_#018,"But don't forget to take care of yourself. 
Look─your leg's wounded."
MID_ED2_#019,"[Veyle] 
This kind of thing happens all the time."
MID_ED2_#020,"[Alear] 
It looks pretty deep... There, that ought to hold 
for a while."
MID_ED2_#021,"[Veyle] 
Thank you. You're quite kind to help a complete 
stranger like me."
MID_ED2_#022,"[Alear] 
You're not a stranger. You saved my 
life, remember?"
MID_ED2_#023,"That makes us friends, as far as I'm concerned. 
And friends help each other."
MID_ED2_#024,"[Veyle] 
Friends..."
MID_ED2_#025,...
MID_ED2_#026,"[Alear] 
Should I not have said that?"
MID_ED2_#027,"[Veyle] 
No, no. I'm just so happy to have someone I can 
call a friend. It's like a dream."
MID_ED2_#028,"I can't recall the last time I was treated with 
such kindness."
MID_ED2_#029,"[Alear] 
What do you mean by that?"
MID_ED2_#030,"[Veyle] 
I'm sorry, but I have to go."
MID_ED2_#031,"[Alear] 
Are you sure?"
MID_ED2_#032,"[Veyle] 
Thank you for the bandage. Hope to see you 
again, ."

I believe you. It might be an Emblem Ring."
MID_OP1_#036,"[Alfred] 
Please, go on. What did it say?"
MID_OP1_#037,"[Yunaka] 
Hm... If I remember right, it asked me to take it 
to the Divine Dragon."

To me?"
MID_OP1_#039,"[Yunaka] 
Is that─ Did you─ Are you saying you're the 
Divine Dragon?"
MID_OP1_#040,"[Alear] 
Yes, I am. I'm sorry I didn't mention it sooner. 
I'm the Divine Dragon ."
MID_OP1_#041,"[Alfred] 
And now that we're doing introductions, 
I'm Alfred, the prince of Firene."
MID_OP1_#042,"[Yunaka] 
Holy brocc-oly! Why didn't you lead with that?!"
MID_OP1_#043,"I think I just had a heart attack... Nope, false 
alarm. Whew."
MID_OP1_#044,"[Alfred] 
I'm so sorry. I never meant to impact 
your health."
MID_OP1_#045,"[Alear] 
Yunaka, how did you find the ring?"
MID_OP1_#046,"[Yunaka] 
I was walking along the border, minding my 
own business, when I heard a woman's voice."
MID_OP1_#047,"""Help me... I'm right here... I'm by your foot."""
MID_OP1_#048,"[Alear] 
Huh. You're quite the performer."
MID_OP1_#049,"[Yunaka] 
Anyway, I picked up the ring and she said, 
""Take me to the Divine Dragon."""
MID_OP1_#050,"But at that point, I had no idea where the Divine 
Dragon was! So I told her I couldn't help."
MID_OP1_#051,"She knew the way, though. Told me to start 
heading for the capital of Firene."
MID_OP1_#052,"[Alfred] 
That's good advice. The quickest way to get to 
Lythos is through the capital."
MID_OP1_#053,"[Yunaka] 
But on the way, I was attacked by bandits and 
ran off full speed...and now the ring's gone."
MID_OP1_#054,"I must have dropped it somewhere! Woe is me! 
Sniffle, sniffle."
MID_OP1_#055,"But now that you're here, you're gonna help me 
find it! Right? Right?"
MID_OP1_#056,"[Alear] 
After hearing her story, this definitely sounds 
like an Emblem Ring."
MID_OP1_#057,"Probably the Ring of the Dawn Maiden. But that 
means someone took it from the shrine."
MID_OP1_#058,"[Alfred] 
Or it could be another Emblem Ring. We'll just 
have to find it and see for ourselves."
MID_OP1_#059,"[Alear] 
All right, Yunaka. We'll help you."
MID_OP1_#060,"[Yunaka] 
Golly, that's great news! She'll be so happy if 
you're the one who finds her!"
MID_OP1_#061,"[Alear] 
Let's start by retracing your steps."
MID_OP2_#001,"[Alfred] 1

[Alear] 
No sign of the ring so far..."
MID_OP2_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Maybe somebody got to it before we did."
MID_OP2_#003,"[Alfred] 
Yeah, everyone's combing the area. If it was 
lying around, we would have found it by now."
MID_OP2_#004,"[Alear] 
You're sure you didn't lose it before the 
bandits attacked?"
MID_OP2_#005,"[Yunaka] 
I had it on me when I passed through that 
ghost town over there..."
MID_OP2_#006,Huh?!
MID_OP2_#007,"[Alear] 
What is it?"
MID_OP2_#008,"[Yunaka] 
It looks like the town's overrun with bandits."
MID_OP2_#009,"[Alear] 
What? How can you tell?"
MID_OP2_#010,"[Yunaka] 
I'll bet these are the same chumps who 
ambushed me earlier."

Let's take a closer look."
MID_OP3_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Alear] 2

MID_OP3_#002,"[Yunaka]

about it."
MID_OP3_#003,And that means one of them's got...
MID_OP3_#004,Aha. Right there.
MID_OP3_#005,"[Alear] 
You see it?"
MID_OP3_#006,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah. A burly guy with something glinting in 
his hand. That's got to be our missing ring."
MID_OP3_#007,"[Alfred] 
What do you think, Divine One? Is it an 
Emblem Ring?"
MID_OP3_#008,"[Alear] 
Hmm... He's too far. I really can't say."
MID_OP3_#009,"You must have great eyesight, Yunaka."
MID_OP3_#010,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah, I have a killer's eyes."
MID_OP3_#011,"[Alear] 
What was that?"
MID_OP3_#012,"[Yunaka] 
Killer eyes! I've got killer eyes! You know, 
they're great at seeing stuff!"
MID_OP3_#013,"If you ever need something looked at real good, 
I'm your gal! Hehehe..."
MID_OP3_#014,"Anyway! What's the plan? Now we've got two 
problems that need solving."
MID_OP3_#015,"[Alear] 
A stolen ring, and a town full of bandits."
MID_OP3_#016,"[Alfred] 
The ring's our first priority, but we can't leave 
them unchecked."
MID_OP3_#017,"[Yunaka] 
We'll only attract attention if we all charge in 
at once. I say we split up."
MID_OP3_#018,"You know, send in a small group to recover 
the ring. Nice and stealthy."
MID_OP3_#019,"[Alear] 
All right."
MID_OP3_#020,"[Yunaka] 
OK, then! C'mon, Divine One, you're with me!"
