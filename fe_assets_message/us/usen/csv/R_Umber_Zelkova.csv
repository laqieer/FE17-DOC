[Zelkov] 
My great work is *complete,* Amber. This is 
what I will send to your family."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Amber] 
Whoa! Zelkov! I can't believe it. The stitching... 
The craftsmanship..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Amber] 
This is the most perfect sweater I've ever seen! 
It even beats my own family's work!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Zelkov] 
I have now *expressed* my gratitude. Farewell."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Amber] 
Hey, Zelkov! Wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Zelkov] 
Hm? Do you have some *additional* business?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Amber] 
I really mean it. You just surpassed generations 
of homegrown knitting skills in a single sweater."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Amber] 
I know you put a lot of effort into it...but there 
has to be a secret. How did you do it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Zelkov] 
Idle pursuits provide me a reason to continue 
living. They are a *failsafe,* of sorts."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Amber] 
What, like a...back-up plan?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Zelkov] 
To me, the most frightening prospect is to live 
without purpose. To be *empty* of motivation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Zelkov] 
My current purpose is to *safeguard* Princess 
Ivy. But that is only until peace has been won."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Zelkov] 
That is why I require a *failsafe*─a secondary 
purpose in which to find meaning."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Amber] 
Whoa. That sounds intense... I mean, I have my 
own goals, but I mostly just have fun every day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Zelkov] 
In that respect, Amber, I *envy* you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Amber] 
Listen, Zelkov... If you really do lose your 
reason for living when the war ends..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Amber] 
Why don't you move to my old hometown? 
Y'know, the alpaca hamlet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Zelkov] 
What *purpose* would that serve?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Amber] 
Are you kidding? With knitting skills like yours, 
folks would be throwing money at you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Amber] 
You could make clothes and decorations out of 
alpaca wool and pet actual alpacas all day!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Zelkov] 
I do see a certain...*appeal* in that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Amber] 
You should definitely visit first. Y'know, get a 
feel for things before you put down roots?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Amber] 
My whole family─including me─would 
welcome you with open arms and hugs to spare!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Zelkov] 
Very well. I can commit to a *visit,* certainly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Zelkov] 
Whatever the future may hold, we can have at 
least that much to look forward to."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Amber] 
Sorry to keep you waiting, Zelkov! Guess what 
just arrived? It's the alpaca wool from home!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Most excellent. With respect to *fluff,* it 
surpasses my wildest expectations."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Amber] 
Of course it does! Alpaca wool is warm, light, 
and super tough. It's the perfect material!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Zelkov] 
This is indeed the finest. The creation of my 
*ultimate* masterpiece is now assured."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Zelkov] 
When all the knitting world lays eyes upon my 
work, Amber, *you* will have their gratitude."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Amber] 
My family knits things with alpaca wool too. 
See my sweater under here? My dad made this!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Zelkov] 
I see. Now, as to the matter of *payment...*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Amber] 
Oh, I don't need any money. Consider it a gift!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Zelkov] 
One must give payment for services rendered. 
Otherwise, one has incurred a *debt.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Amber] 
Really, it's fine. When I wrote to my folks about 
you, they were happy to send the wool."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Amber] 
I told them you wanted to craft with our farm's 
famous fuzzy stuff, and they said it was free!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Amber] 
You wouldn't turn down an act of kindness 
from some humble alpaca farmers, would you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Zelkov] 
If it is for the sake of the ones who provided 
it to me, then *reluctantly* I will accept."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Zelkov] 
But they shall have a token of my gratitude. 
A sweater of *pristine* craftsmanship."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Zelkov] 
I can express the true extent of my appreciation 
*only* by surpassing the quality of their craft."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Amber] 
Whoa! I bet the folks at home would be thrilled 
to get a sweater knit by you, Zelkov."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Zelkov] 
Then it is decided. I will not rest until the whole 
of your family *marvels* at what I produce."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Amber, I wish to *speak* with you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Amber] 
You? The retainer of the crown princess? Of 
Elusia? You want to talk to ME?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Amber] 
I can tell you right now, if you're fishing for 
intel on Brodia stuff, I am not your target."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Zelkov] 
No, no. It is not a *political* matter."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Zelkov] 
It is rather more *personal* than that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Amber] 
Oh no. What do you want with me? Is it a fight? 
I haven't even done anything to you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Zelkov] 
I require the *wool* of an alpaca."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Amber] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Zelkov] 
Specifically, I require the wool that comes from 
a *particular* alpaca hamlet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Zelkov] 
I have been led to believe you are *familiar* 
with this place."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Zelkov] 
You should be aware, then, that the *wool* from 
there is finer than any other."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Amber] 
Yeah, that's true. The alpacas back home are 
extra furry and SUPER fluffy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Zelkov] 
I must have it, Amber. You must *procure* it 
for me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Amber] 
Well, I could send a letter back home. They'd 
ship some here for sure...but what's it for?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Zelkov] 
It will be put toward the purpose of *knitting.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Amber] 
Whoa. You like to knit, Zelkov? I never, ever 
would have guessed that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Zelkov] 
It should not *surprise* you that I pursue a craft 
of such delicate grace and elegance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Zelkov] 
To the point, I require the highest-quality alpaca 
wool to craft my *ultimate* masterpiece."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Amber] 
I'm into it! If it's just for crafting, I'll get you a 
bunch of the stuff. No sweat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Amber] 
Besides, I've gotta see what you make with it. 
I bet it's gonna be weird."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Zelkov] 
Thank you, Amber. I am grateful for your 
*assistance* in this matter."
