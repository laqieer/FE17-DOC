[Alear] 2 

[Fogado] 
Nice going! You really showed 'em what the 
Divine Dragon can do."
MID_ED1_#002,"Now, to Solm Palace! Stay close─I'd hate for 
you to split off and get lost. Again."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alear] 
Thanks, Fogado."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Fogado] 
[Alfred] 1 
[Alfred] 
This ought to be interesting. It's been years 
since I visited the palace."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alear] 
Years? I thought Solm and Firene had a 
good relationship."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alfred] 
Our countries are allies, sure, but that doesn't 
mean our families are close-knit."
MID_ED1_#007,"In fact, out of Solm's whole royal family, my 
mother and I have only met Queen Seforia."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Alear] 
What? No one else?"
MID_ED1_#009,"[Alfred] 
Nope. Not the royal consort, not the crown 
princess, and not her brother, the prince."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
That's strange."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
I never met them either."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Alfred] 
Same thing happened to you, huh?"
MID_ED1_#013,"[Diamant] 
I may have forgotten the way to the palace, 
but I remember well what happened there."
MID_ED1_#014,"It was a strange scene. The queen received us 
alone, with no one attending her."
MID_ED1_#015,"When we asked to meet the princess and prince, 
she told us they weren't there."
MID_ED1_#016,"[Alfred] 
She told us the exact same thing! I asked when 
they'd be back and she said, ""No idea."""
MID_ED1_#017,"It didn't make sense. If you're royalty, you can't 
leave your castle whenever you like."
MID_ED1_#018,"I got the feeling she was hiding them from us... 
But why? Were they sick? Or shy?"
MID_ED1_#019,"[Alear] 
Shy... That would surprise me."
MID_ED1_#020,Everyone we've met here has been so friendly.
MID_ED1_#021,"[Alfred] 
The queen is too. There are just some things 
about the royal family that don't add up."
MID_ED1_#022,"Let's be on guard, all right?"
MID_ED1_#023,"[Alear] 
Got it."
MID_ED2_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Fogado] 
We're here! Solm Palace. Now all that's left is 
asking those guards to open the gate."
MID_ED2_#002,"[Alear] 
Thanks for leading the way, Fogado. I don't 
know how we'd have gotten here without you."
MID_ED2_#003,"[Fogado] 
Of course. Just another day in the life of 
a Sentinel."
MID_ED2_#004,"[Alear] 
I'll be sure to commend you to the queen. 
Anyway, now we'd better be on our way..."
MID_ED2_#005,"[Fogado] 
Huh? Uh, Fogado, what are you doing?"
MID_ED2_#006,"[Alear] 

[Fogado] 1 

[Fogado] 
Talking to the guards! What else?"
MID_ED2_#007,"[Fogado] 
[Diamant] 2 
[Diamant] 
Does he have a meeting with the queen as well?"
MID_ED2_#008,"[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
Beats me. Maybe he's here on some kind of 
Sentinel business."
MID_ED2_#009,"[Diamant] 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Fogado, wait for us."
MID_ED2_#010,"[Alfred] 

[Alear] 

[Fogado] 1 

[Fogado] 
Hey! I'm home!"
MID_ED2_#011,"[Fogado]

[Alear] 
Home?"

Yes, let the gate...be open!"

[Ivy] 
""Prince""? Did that guard say, ""prince""?"
MID_ED2_#016,"[Alfred] 
Unless we misheard him...in exactly the 
same way..."
MID_ED2_#017,"[Fogado] 1 

[Fogado] 
Thanks for waiting, folks."
MID_ED2_#018,"[Ivy] 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Fogado, we're a little confused... Are you 
the prince of Solm?"
MID_ED2_#019,"[Fogado] 
Did I not mention that?"
MID_ED2_#020,"[Alfred] 
[Diamant] 4 
[Diamant] 
Ah, no, you didn't."
MID_ED2_#021,"[Fogado] 
Whoops! Egg, meet face. Right, let me do 
this properly."
MID_ED2_#022,"I'm Fogado, captain of the Sentinels, and the 
prince of Solm. Welcome to my family's palace."
MID_ED2_#023,"Come on in! You wanted to meet Mom, right?"
MID_ED2_#024,Mom! Visitors!
MID_ED2_#025,"[Fogado] 

[Alear] 
What is happening?"
MID_ED2_#026,"[Ivy] 1 

[Ivy] 
I didn't realize he was royalty."
MID_ED2_#027,"[Alfred] 3 
[Alfred] 
A prince personally going on patrols... Not 
something you see every day."
MID_ED2_#028,"[Diamant] 
I wonder why we never met him before. He 
doesn't seem sick. He's certainly not shy."
MID_ED2_#029,"[Alear] 
It's a mystery. Anyway, let's head in."
MID_ED2_#030,Don't want to keep Prince Fogado waiting.

forces up to?"
MID_ED3_#006,"[Zephia] 
They passed through the Shadowy Moor. 
It appears they've arrived in Solm."
MID_ED3_#007,"ヴェイル_フード_顔出し 
So they did not return to Brodia─they're 
gathering more rings. Good."
MID_ED3_#008,"[Zephia] 
[Marni] 2 
[Marni] 
Can we go after them, Lady Veyle? I'm itching 
for a rematch!"
MID_ED3_#009,"ヴェイル_フード_顔出し 
Patience, Marni."
MID_ED3_#010,"If we wait, we can steal Solm's ring from them 
along with the others."
MID_ED3_#011,"[Marni] 
Smart! I'll be a good girl and wait, then."
MID_ED3_#012,"ヴェイル_フード_顔出し 
You are a treasure, Marni."

Isn't she just? The pride of the Four Hounds."
MID_ED3_#014,"[Marni] 
Hehe, you two really heap on the praise. 
That's why I love ya!"
MID_ED3_#015,"[Griss] 4 
[Griss] 
Heh... You're such a child."
MID_ED3_#016,"Praise is for chumps. It's much more fun to 
be punished."
MID_ED3_#017,"ヴェイル_フード_顔出し 
Worry not, Griss. You will soon have all the 
agony your heart could want."
MID_ED3_#018,"[Griss]

[Alear] 
So, this is Solm. It's very...sandy."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Ivy] 
The queendom's land is covered in deserts. 
I believe this one is called Tullah."
MID_OP1_#003,"And as you've no doubt noticed, it's much 
hotter than in Elusia. I fear I may melt."
MID_OP1_#004,"[Diamant] 3 
[Diamant] 
What now, Divine One?"
MID_OP1_#005,"[Alear] 
We'd better head straight to the palace. I just 
hope the Hounds haven't gotten there first."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Ivy] 
During my time in Elusia, the Four Hounds did 
pay a few visits to Solm."
MID_OP1_#007,"But they came back empty-handed each time, 
so I expect the palace is unharmed."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Alfred] 4

Thanks, Ivy. Pretty handy, having an enemy as 
a friend."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Ivy] 
I will choose to take that as a compliment."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Alear] 
Which Emblem Ring was entrusted to Solm?"
MID_OP1_#011,"[Ivy] 
The Radiant Hero─said to be among the 
most powerful."
MID_OP1_#012,"Needless to say, it would be quite a boon."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Alear] 
Sounds like exactly what we need right now. 
Let's get going."

Hey, you don't look like you're from around here. 
What's with the outfits?"
MID_OP2C_#002,"[Alear] 
Uh..."
MID_OP2C_#003,"[Fogado] 
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. But I took one look 
and thought to myself, ""Self, they are lost."""
MID_OP2C_#004,"[Alear] 
And, uh, who are you?"
MID_OP2C_#005,"[Fogado] 
Who am I? I'm the guy. Here to keep the peace 
in Tullah Desert. Call me Fogado, yeah?"
MID_OP2C_#006,"$ 
[Fogado] MPID_Fogato 
As captain of the Sentinels, it's my duty to help people 
in need. You fine folks need a hand, just lemme know."
MID_OP2C_#007,"[Alear] 
Thanks for that. As for myself, I'm the Divine Dragon 
. From Lythos."
MID_OP2C_#008,"[Fogado] 
Wait, you're who?! You're telling me the Divine Dragon 
is here, in my desert? No kidding?"
MID_OP2C_#009,"[Alear] 
Yes."
MID_OP2C_#010,"[Fogado] 
Aah... I had no idea! I'm so sorry─I didn't mean 
to be rude."
MID_OP2C_#011,"[Alear] 
You weren't. There's no need to be formal with me."
MID_OP2C_#012,"[Fogado] 
Didn't expect you to be casual. That's cool."
MID_OP2C_#012_2,"[Fogado] 
But hey. What brings you all out to my piece 
of the world?"
MID_OP2C_#013,"[Alear] 
We're on our way to Solm Palace...but we don't know 
how to get there."
MID_OP2C_#014,"[Fogado] 
This is your lucky day. C'mon, just follow me. If I know 
how to get anywhere, it's the palace."
MID_OP2C_#015,"[Alear] 
You don't mind?"
MID_OP2C_#016,"[Fogado] 
Of course I don't! You know what's out there? Sand as far as the 
eye can see. And I would rather you not have to deal with that."
MID_OP2C_#016_2,"[Fogado] 
Lucky we met, huh? Haha!"
MID_OP2_#001,"[Ivy] 1

[Alear] 
Let's see. Which way to the palace again?"
MID_OP2_#002,"[Ivy] 
Divine One...I believe we passed that enormous 
rock earlier."
MID_OP2_#003,"[Alear] 
What, really? Ugh... All this terrain looks 
the same to me."
MID_OP2_#004,"[Ivy] 
I wish I could help. My knowledge of Solmic 
geography comes only from maps."
MID_OP2_#005,"Wait a moment. Prince Alfred, Prince Diamant..."
MID_OP2_#006,"Your nations are allied with Solm. Haven't you 
gone to the palace before?"
MID_OP2_#007,"[Diamant] 3 
[Alfred] 4 
[Diamant] 
I did, but...quite a long time ago. I don't 
remember the way."
MID_OP2_#008,"[Alfred] 
I traveled from Firene. I've got no clue how to 
get there from Elusia."
MID_OP2_#009,"[Ivy] 
So none of us knows where to go."
MID_OP2_#010,...Ah.
MID_OP2_#011,"All right, I'll say it. We're lost."
MID_OP2_#012,"[Alear] 
I'm afraid so."
MID_OP2_#013,"We can't afford to waste time. I wonder if 
there's a landmark to go by..."
MID_OP2_2_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Alear] 
Thank you, Fogado. We appreciate your help."
MID_OP2_2_#002,"[Fogado] 2 

[Fogado] 
Don't sweat it. Oh, you know what? I do have 
a quick errand to take care of first."
MID_OP2_2_#003,"[Alear] 
An errand? What kind of errand?"
MID_OP2_2_#004,"[Fogado] 
More of a mission. See, not too long ago, these 
freaky creatures started appearing everywhere."
MID_OP2_2_#005,"As captain of the Sentinels, when I get a report 
about a problem in the desert, I take care of it."
MID_OP2_2_#006,"Sorry about this. You have a sit, and I'll take 
you to the palace right after I'm done."
MID_OP2_2_#007,"[Alear] 
Actually, why don't we come with you? 
We can help."
MID_OP2_2_#008,"[Fogado] 
That'd be great! My friends went ahead of me─ 
let's go meet up with them."
MID_OP3_#001,"[Fogado] 4 

[Fogado] 
The problem's even worse than I expected."
MID_OP3_#002,"Hey, there they are! Pandreo! Bunet!"
MID_OP3_#003,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Bunet] 3 

[Pandreo] 
Fogado? You're late! I was starting to think you 
wanted us to die out here."
MID_OP3_#004,"[Bunet] 
With any further delay, these creatures would 
have made a meal of us."
MID_OP3_#005,"[Fogado] 
Sorry about that, fellas. But hey, I brought help!"
MID_OP3_#006,"[Pandreo] 
Help? What do you mean, help?"
MID_OP3_#007,"[Fogado] 
Oh, Pandreo, my pious friend. This is really 
gonna blow your mind."
MID_OP3_#008,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Hello. I'm the Divine Dragon . 
Nice to meet you."
MID_OP3_#009,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, it's the Divine Dragon."
MID_OP3_#010,THE DIVINE DRAGON?!
MID_OP3_#011,"Hang on... What were you thinking, bringing the 
Divine Dragon here?!"
MID_OP3_#012,"[Bunet] 
That hair... Like two scoops of sorbet, swirling 
together in the desert heat..."
MID_OP3_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Hey, save it for the kitchen! That's a deity 
you're talking about!"
MID_OP3_#014,"[Fogado] 
I knew this would get you two fired up. Divine 
One, these are my Sentinel friends."
MID_OP3_#015,"What do you say─ready to handle a mission 
with us?"
MID_OP3_#016,"[Alear] 
Ready."
