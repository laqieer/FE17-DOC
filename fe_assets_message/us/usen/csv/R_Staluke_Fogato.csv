[Fogado] 
Hello, Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Guh... Prince Fogado!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
Haha, I wonder when you'll stop greeting me 
like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
I'm sorry. Your smile shines so bright... My first 
impulse is always to flee."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alcryst] 
I must ask...how did you grow to be such a 
powerful beacon of good humor?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Fogado] 
You want to know about my childhood? Well, I 
can give you a quick synopsis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Fogado] 
Not that there was anything all that remarkable 
about it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Fogado] 
Being the first prince of Solm, I received a 
formal education."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Fogado] 
But there weren't many rules holding me down. 
I was allowed to roam free."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Fogado] 
I used to sneak out of the palace all the time 
and just...hit the town. Have fun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Amazing. I'd heard that the people of Solm 
celebrate their freedom..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alcryst] 
But I had no idea that applied to royalty as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alcryst] 
I'm beginning to understand how that lifestyle 
shaped the prince I see now..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alcryst] 
A warm, outstanding person who makes new 
friends as easily as he greets the day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Fogado] 
Thanks, Prince Alcryst. I appreciate that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Ah... Once again, your radiant gaze... I might 
crumble into ashes!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Fogado] 
Hold up! Before you run away, let me 
say something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Fogado] 
And this is going to be hard, because you're 
terrible at taking compliments."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alcryst] 
Oh no. I'm so sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Fogado] 
No, not that. Maybe, just this once, could you 
believe me when I say I like you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Fogado] 
I'd even go so far as to call you, my fellow 
kid-brother prince, a friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alcryst] 
Oh... Oh, Prince Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alcryst] 
I do. I-I believe you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alcryst] 
Thank you for calling someone like me a friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alcryst] 
I like you, too, Prince Fogado..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Fogado] 
At last, you finally came out and said it! 
You liiike me! You liiike me!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Alcryst] 
Ah! Ahh! I don't know what came over me!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alcryst] 
To think I could reciprocate─I had no right. I'm 
so sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Fogado] 
What are you apologizing for? Now we know we 
like each other. We're basically best friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Alcryst] 
Best friends? I've never had a best friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Alcryst] 
I will admit, that makes me a bit─ No, it makes 
me a LOT happy. Thank you, Prince Fogado."

[Fogado] 
Hey, Prince Alcryst! Quick question. Can you 
tell me about your childhood?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Huh? Why do you want to know about that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Fogado] 
Well, I was thinking about our somewhat 
abbreviated conversation the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Fogado] 
You know, how our situations are similar, but 
our personalities are different."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Fogado] 
And I thought maybe the difference can be 
explained by our upbringings."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alcryst] 
I see. I'll share broad details with you, but be 
warned─it's not very interesting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Fogado] 
That's totally fine. Trust me, I'm all ears."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alcryst] 
I was born the second prince of Brodia, with a 
significant age gap between my brother and me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alcryst] 
As far back as I can remember, people have 
praised my older brother for his skills."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alcryst] 
""One could not ask for a better successor to 
the Brodian throne,"" they would say."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alcryst] 
But when it came to me, the thing I heard most 
often was, ""Diamant would have done better."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Fogado] 
Ouch. So you always felt like second fiddle. 
That's rough."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alcryst] 
It's my own fault. I'm a lost cause."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Fogado] 
Did you ever just snap and say, ""Forget him! 
Look at me!"""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alcryst] 
No, never. I would never allow a thought like 
that to cross my mind."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alcryst] 
My brother is perfect. That's the plain truth. 
It's not his fault I can't compare."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alcryst] 
At the same time, I am aware that those truths 
form the backbone of my gloomy personality."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Fogado] 
So instead of holding a grudge against him, you 
just accepted that you were inferior."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Fogado] 
You know what you are? A kind person. Maybe 
that's why I like you so much."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Oh... Gah..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alcryst] 
You... You're saying you like me? You're such 
an inspiring person, Prince Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alcryst] 
I must not risk dragging you down!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alcryst] 
I have to go again! I'm sorry! I'm sorryyy!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alcryst] 

[Fogado] 
And he's gone. Well, see you around, 
Prince Alcryst!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Ah! Prince Fogado!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Fogado] 
Hey, hey! What's going on, Prince Alcryst? 
Why are you running away from me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 
I apologize. You're always in such high spirits... 
I feared my presence might dampen your mood."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Fogado] 
Yeesh! I think you're being a little hard 
on yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Fogado] 
Besides, we actually have a lot in common."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Fogado] 
You're the second prince of a kingdom, I'm the 
first prince of a queendom. Tomato, Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alcryst] 
I suppose you're right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Fogado] 
Um, why the sigh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alcryst] 
We do hold similar positions. But if that is the 
case...why are we so different?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alcryst] 
You're so carefree and sociable...and I am a 
dismal burden on everyone I meet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Fogado] 
There you go again. Always so negative."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Fogado] 
Not that I mind your dour attitude. It's actually 
one of the reasons I like you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alcryst] 
You find me likable?! But that's impossible! 
I don't deserve such kindness."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alcryst] 
Oh, this is bad. If you continue, I may find 
myself in a dangerous spot..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Fogado] 
Aww. What's so dangerous about me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alcryst] 
That! Your gentle eyes and accepting smile! 
Please, don't look at me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alcryst] 
Your pure heart is shining a spotlight on me. 
You'll reveal me for the waste that I am!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alcryst] 
I...I have to go!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alcryst] 
I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Alcryst] 

[Fogado] 
Hahaha, man. That guy really knows how to 
make an exit."
