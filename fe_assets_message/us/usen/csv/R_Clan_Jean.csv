[Clanne] 
Ow!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Jean] 
Clanne! Are you OK?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
I'm fine. I just fell and got a scrape."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jean] 
Even a minor scratch could get infected if 
left untreated."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Jean] 
Show me and I can treat it for you right here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Clanne] 
All right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jean] 
It's bleeding a bit. I can fix that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Clanne] 
Yeesh, that stings!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jean] 
Don't worry, I'm finished already. That wasn't 
so bad, was it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Clanne] 
Heh, thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Jean] 
No need for thanks. It's the least I could do to 
repay you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Clanne] 
Huh? For what?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jean] 
One thing you said to me last time stuck."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Jean] 
About learning from your mistakes so you don't 
go repeating them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Clanne] 
That does ring a bell."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jean] 
It was such genuine advice. Like something 
I'd hear from my family back home."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Clanne] 
Thanks, Jean..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jean] 
You know I come from an island in Firene. This 
place is nice, but it doesn't feel like home."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jean] 
But what you said helped to change that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Clanne] 
Huh."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Clanne] 
If you miss your family, Jean, you can think 
of me as an older brother."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Clanne] 
I might still slip up on occasion, and I have a 
lot of growing left to do, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Jean] 
There's nothing wrong with that. If I had a big 
brother like you, there's nothing I would fear."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Clanne] 
Ha! I'd be happy to help."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Jean] 
It's nearly dinner time. How's that scratch? 
Do you need help walking?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Clanne] 
It's feeling a lot better now. Your treatment did 
the trick."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Jean] 
Maybe you should lean on me anyway. Isn't that 
what family is for?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Jean] 2 
[Jean] 
Say, Clanne, do you remember how you helped 
me when I got lost gathering herbs?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
Mm-hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Jean] 
As luck would have it, I found a use for them 
when I met a wounded child near our last battle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Jean] 
Treatment was simple with the herbs 
I'd collected."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Clanne] 
Well, that's great news!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Jean] 
I hate to think what would have become of the 
poor child if I'd stayed lost in that forest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Jean] 
You helped them as much as I did, Clanne. 
So, thank you for that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Clanne] 
Oh, I didn't do much. I just gave you directions."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Jean] 
But your help then rippled outward."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Jean] 
The child was from a poor family. I don't think 
a visit to the doctor was in the cards."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jean] 
If I hadn't come along with those herbs, the 
wound might have gone septic."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Clanne] 
Yeesh."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Jean] 
I may have sniffled a bit, but I didn't really think 
getting lost was that big a deal."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jean] 
But when a doctor is waylaid, lives could hang 
in the balance. Every second counts."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Jean] 
I really must be more careful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Clanne] 
Jean, I'm not saying you're wrong, but don't 
beat yourself up too much."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Clanne] 
Everybody has bad days."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Clanne] 
But if you ask yourself, ""How did I get myself 
into this?"" you can prevent it next time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Clanne] 
Though I always seem to make the same 
mistakes as a Steward of the Dragon..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Jean] 
Mistakes? You? I can't picture it. You always 
seem so sure of yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Clanne] 
Oh, not at all. I'm still just an apprentice."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Clanne] 
There are so many people older than me here 
that I'm glad to have someone closer to my age."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Jean] 
Hm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Clanne] 
Oh no, did I say something wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Jean] 
No, no! I'm happy to hear that. I always thought 
I was a burden to people."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Jean] 
So I'm glad to hear someone is happy to have 
me around."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Clanne] 
I don't think it's as bad as you fear."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Jean] 
You wait and see, Clanne. I'm going to be just 
as good as you someday!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Jean] 2 
[Jean] 
Oh, dash it all! Face it, Jean. You're lost."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jean] 
It'll cause a fuss if I don't get back soon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Jean] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Clanne] 1 
[Clanne] 
Jean? Is everything all right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Jean] 
Oh... Uh, hello, Clanne."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Clanne] 
Were you crying? Did something happen?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Jean] 
I...I wasn't crying. I was just a bit anxious from 
losing my way, that's all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jean] 
Our forces are getting hurt quite a lot lately. 
I came here to forage for healing herbs."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Clanne] 
Oh! Really? That's very helpful of you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Jean] 
I found the herbs I needed, but then I got caught 
up in my work, and the next thing I know..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Clanne] 
You got lost."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Jean] 
What about you, Clanne? Why are you here?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Clanne] 
I'm here for herbs too. The kind I need to 
make pickles."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Jean] 
Oh. So, uh...do you know the way back?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Clanne] 
Oh, yes! I come here a lot, so I can help get 
you back safely."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jean] 
That would be very kind of you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Clanne] 
You have to pay close attention to your 
surroundings when going into the forest alone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Jean] 
You're right, of course. I'll be more careful 
next time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Clanne] 
Good thing I happened to run into you, huh? 
Let's go home."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Jean] 
Thank you, Clanne."
