MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,"Oh, you're awake."
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,"You think something humorous must have 
happened to me?"
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,You noticed me smiling?
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004,"Now that you mention it, I suppose I was."
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,This place...
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002,I feel accepted here. Forgiven.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,You seem so pure in slumber. So trusting.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,If that means you trust me...
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004,I'm glad.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,So much of the world is tiresome...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,but I never tire of being here.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,When I'm near you...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004,I feel I can actually relax and be myself.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,Did you hear all that?
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,My weakness must be appalling to you.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,"Yet you look at me with such kindness in 
your eyes."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004,You're always saving me.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,"It's a relief to see you, Divine One."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,Sorry to wake you.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,I had a bad dream.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,I suppose I came to you for comfort.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004,"Childish, I know."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,I dreamed of...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,an Elusia in ruin.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,"When I woke, my first thought was to come 
to you straightaway."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004,"I knew once I laid eyes on you, there would be 
nothing to fear."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,"I came here to pray, if that's all right."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,I have something to say to Queen Lumera.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004,"Late as I may be, I accept the invitation."
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,I've long wished for this.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002,To stand in the Somniel...
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#003,To pray at the holiest of altars.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,...
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,Sorry to wake you.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,I only came here to pray.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004,I am finished now.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#005,Allow me to wish my deity a pleasant morning.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,Father told me...
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,about Queen Lumera.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,She invited Elusia's royal family to visit.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004,They never accepted.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#005,"Until now, I suppose..."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,I wonder...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,What was it like for you to wake...
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,after a thousand years?
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004,I wish I could have been here to witness it.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,I hope I am allowed to be in this holy place...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,Morning.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,"I'm grateful that you accept my presence here 
without complaint."
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,Your kindness continues to amaze me.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,Elusia may not like it...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,but I worship the Divine Dragon.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,"As crown princess, I have been forced to keep 
that to myself."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#004,At least until now.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,Morning.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,Good weather today.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,Get some sun.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004,"You don't want to be gloomy like me, do you?"
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,"It's morning, Divine One."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,You wake so readily.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,I envy you.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003,I find sleeping...
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#004,and waking to be a struggle.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,I know I'm not the ideal person to wake you.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,I am not exactly upbeat.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,But the sooner you wake...
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004,the sooner this will be over.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,I'm not very comfortable here.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,"But the opportunity to greet you, first thing 
in the morning..."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004,I couldn't pass it up.
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,I wish I could visit you every morning.
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002,But it wouldn't be appropriate.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,You're awake.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,"I suppose I will be going, then."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,I hope you get a more cheerful visitor tomorrow.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004,Farewell.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,I never thought I'd be here.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,Waking the Divine Dragon...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,I have no experience with this sort of thing.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004,I am frightfully nervous.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,You're awake. Good morning.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,May I come closer?
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,Thank you.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004,I cherish every moment that I'm close to you.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005,Every second that it's just you and me.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,"I've come to see you, Divine One."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002,"Calling you that feels so much more meaningful 
to me now."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,"Ah, you're awake."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,Sorry if I'm here a little early.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,I couldn't wait a moment more to see you.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004,Our time together is everything to me.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,I have a confession.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,I find myself feeling a bit jealous...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,You gave me the Pact Ring...
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,"but you've given your Emblem Ring to others 
as well."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,"It feels ridiculous to say this out loud, but..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,I wish I were the only one devoted to you.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007,I know that's terribly selfish.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning. Were you listening to all that?
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,"Well, good. I want you to know how I feel."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,"And if you ever forget, I'm happy to 
remind you..."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,just how much I adore you.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,Divine One...
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002,"You slept, just like this, for a millennium..."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,I'm glad you're awake.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,"We can't have you sleeping another 
thousand years."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,I think about that moment sometimes.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,"You waking after so long... I wish I could have 
been there."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,You know...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,I owe so much to you.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,"I am strong enough now to endure the very 
hardest battles."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,And the worst nightmares.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,It's all thanks to you.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,"I love you, and I'll never tire of saying it."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007,Such a simple phrase hardly feels like enough...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#008,"but no words will ever be sufficient to convey 
my feelings."
