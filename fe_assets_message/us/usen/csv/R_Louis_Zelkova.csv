[Louis] 
Where are you going, Zelkov?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Regrettably, I cannot stay for tea this time. 
There is *work* to be done."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Louis] 
That's a shame."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Louis] 
In that case, are there any chores I might take 
care of for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Louis] 
I could have your place tidied by the time you 
finish your work."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Zelkov] 
As I've told you, Louis, I have no *desire* to be 
cared for."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Louis] 
Hah, you'll have to forgive me. I can't help but 
feel the need to look after you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Louis] 
I credit this instinct to your strong resemblance 
to my brothers."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Zelkov] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Zelkov] 
I had a younger brother. Long ago."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Not only a brother, in fact. A family."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Zelkov] 
They were killed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Louis] 
My condolences."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Zelkov] 
I am uncertain *exactly* why, but...drinking tea 
with you reminds me of them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Zelkov] 
It is painful to remember that what is lost can 
never be regained."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Zelkov] 
But the *tea*... The tea is lovely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Louis] 
Ah, Zelkov..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Zelkov] 
How *foolish* of me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Zelkov] 
Please *forget* what I've said."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Louis] 
I will not, I think."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Louis] 
I shall await your return with a freshly brewed 
pot of tea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Louis] 
Hopefully that will entice you to return."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Zelkov] 
Hm-hm, you are a *strange* one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Zelkov] 
But if you *insist* on waiting around for me...then 
the least I can do is enjoy the tea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Louis] 
I'll hold you to that. Now then, off you go!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Zelkov] 
Farewell."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 
[Louis] 
Good day, Zelkov. Would you care to join me for 
a spot of tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Louis, I am beginning to suspect you are 
*attempting* to spy on me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Louis] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Louis] 
Very well. I shall be plain with my intentions."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Zelkov] 
At last. By all means, *proceed.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Louis] 
I would like to take care of you, Zelkov."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Zelkov] 
Excuse me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Louis] 
You see, I am the eldest of four brothers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Louis] 
My mother died early on, so I had a tumultuous 
upbringing in a house solely of men."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Louis] 
With my father providing for the family, it fell 
to me to look after my brothers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Louis] 
My impulse to take good care of people remains 
strong even to this day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Zelkov] 
And you direct this impulse toward *me*?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Louis] 
Indeed. You strike me as someone who wants 
looking after."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Zelkov] 
Thus the incessant *invitations* to tea, 
I surmise."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Louis] 
Quite so. In a way, I feel as though you could 
be one of my younger brothers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Zelkov] 
Ridiculous. I am *older* than you, you know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Louis] 
That matters little to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Zelkov] 
I suppose it matters little to *me* as well, so 
long as you have no *ulterior* motive."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Zelkov] 
I do understand the *yearning* an older brother 
feels to care for a younger one."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Louis] 
Ah! Do you have siblings as well?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Zelkov] 
Perhaps I do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Zelkov] 
In any case, your efforts are wasted. I have no 
*desire* to be cared for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Louis] 
I suspected you'd say that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Louis] 
Please forgive me for running roughshod over 
your own feelings on the matter."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Zelkov] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Zelkov] 
In lieu of an apology, I will *accept* a relaxing 
cup of tea."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Zelkov] 
You possess *leaves* which help to impart 
a restful sleep, if I recall?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Louis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029,"[Louis] 
Wait right here, Zelkov! I shall prepare it 
at once!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Why are you *staring* at me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Louis] 
Greetings, Zelkov."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Zelkov] 
I asked you a *question.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Louis] 
Hah! I meant nothing by it, I assure you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Louis] 
But if you have the time, might I invite you to 
join me for a cup of tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Zelkov] 
This *invitation* makes little sense to me. You 
and I are not exactly close."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Louis] 
It is because we aren't close that I invited you. 
I should like to get to know you better."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Zelkov] 
Dispense with the *pretense,* please. What is it 
you want?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Louis] 
My dear Zelkov, I have no ulterior motive here. 
I merely thought we could bond over tea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Zelkov] 
Regrettably, then, I must *decline.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Louis] 
What a shame. I suppose I'll have to put away 
my specially made soothing tea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Zelkov] 
I do not *understand* you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Louis] 
Well, it's plain to see that you don't sleep much."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Zelkov] 
I fail to see *your* interest in the matter."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Louis] 
It doesn't impact me directly at all. But as your 
friend, I am concerned."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Zelkov] 
This is going *nowhere.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Zelkov] 
Whatever your *intentions* might be...stay out 
of my affairs."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Zelkov] 
[Louis] 
My dear Zelkov. You'll find it will take more to 
dissuade me than that."
