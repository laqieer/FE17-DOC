[Clanne] 
Lady Veyle, the hot pepper pickles are 
finally ready!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
Oooh, exciting! Can I give them a try?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
Well, they look terrifyingly spicy, but, um, sure. 
Grab one and try it out!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Clanne] 
Lady Veyle! Are you OK?! Should I call for help?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Veyle] 
It's so..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Clanne] 
Oh gosh, oh geez, oh no! I'll go get help!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
I... I'm all right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Veyle] 
It's just so incredibly good!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Veyle] 
I could go on eating these pickles forever!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Clanne] 
You look like you're in so much pain. Are you 
OK? You can tell me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Veyle] 
Ahh... I feel better than ever!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Veyle] 
Clanne, you've got to try your new recipe."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Clanne] 
Huh?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Veyle] 
No, don't worry. They're really, really good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Clanne] 
Oh... OK. I mean, if you say they're good..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Clanne] 
Mm...mmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Clanne] 
Ugh... Hah... Hah-haah...hot! Hot, hot, hot! HOT!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Clanne] 
So spicy, but...I can sort of feel my mouth 
again, and sort of taste too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Clanne] 
You're right. These are really, really good!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Veyle] 
See? Aren't you glad you tried something new?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Clanne] 
For once, I really am!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Clanne] 
You challenged me to make better pickles. Now 
there's something else I'd like you to try."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Veyle] 
Ooo! Do you have some even spicier pickles 
for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Clanne] 
No, not pickles. I thought maybe you might like 
to try being my sister."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Veyle] 
Oh!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Clanne] 
Nothing serious, you know, just kind of acting 
like brother and, I guess, older sister."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Clanne] 
You helped me make better pickles, so I thought 
I'd help you become comfortable as a sibling."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Veyle] 
That would be nice..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Veyle] 
But is it OK? Wouldn't that be asking a lot 
of you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Clanne] 
Let me be clear. You taught me a whole new 
way of making pickles, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Clanne] 
It's the least I could do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Veyle] 
Oh, I see. Well then...yes. I'll be your sister."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Clanne] 
All right, then. Welcome to the family."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Veyle] 
So I'm the older sister and you're the younger 
brother."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Clanne] 
My sister's the younger twin, so I've always 
wanted an older sibling to see what it's like."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038,"[Veyle] 
And I don't have a younger sibling, so this is 
perfect. From now on, you are my little brother."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#039,"[Clanne] 
Thanks, big sister!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#040,"[Veyle] 
Hehe, it feels a little weird to be called ""big 
sister."" Weird...but good."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Oh, hello, Clanne. Did you get a chance to make 
those peppery pickles yet?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
Well...yes? I'm sort of nervous about how bright 
red the brine is turning, though."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Veyle] 
It'll be all right. I'm sure they're going to be 
so tasty. I can't wait to try them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Clanne] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Veyle] 
What's wrong? You got so quiet all of a sudden."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Clanne] 
It just sort of struck me that you remind me of 
my sister."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Veyle] 
Your sister? Why do you say that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Clanne] 
You said things would work out, even though 
you've got no proof. She does that all the time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Veyle] 
That's a rude thing to say."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Clanne] 
Ah! I'm sorry!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Veyle] 
It's OK."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Veyle] 
You and your sister are twins, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Clanne] 
Mm-hmm! I'm the older one."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Veyle] 
I wonder what having a sibling around is like..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Clanne] 
Wh-what do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Veyle] 
I mean, I was apart from my sibling for so long, 
I feel like I don't know what it's like. Not really."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Veyle] 
It's hard to make up for all the lost time. I guess 
I don't know how to act like...family."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Veyle] 
To be honest, I'm jealous of you. You get to 
spend so much time with your sister."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Clanne] 
I think having a sibling is like... I guess sisters, 
and probably brothers, are like air."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Veyle] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Clanne] 
You take air for granted but you'd miss it a lot if 
it went away. I don't know if that makes sense."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Veyle] 
Yes, I think I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Veyle] 
I would like to be that─a sister who's like air 
to someone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Clanne] 
You can totally be that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Clanne] 
Family is family. It doesn't matter how far apart 
you live, you're somebody's air."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Veyle] 
Thank you, Clanne. I really needed to hear that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Hello, Clanne. What do you have there?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Oh, Lady Veyle. I'm pickling."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Veyle] 
Pickling? What is that? I've never heard of it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Clanne] 
Pickling is preserving meats or vegetables in 
vinegar. Add spices, and they're very tasty."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Clanne] 
I'm developing a new recipe at the moment. 
Would you care to try one?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Veyle] 
Oh yes, I'd like that very much!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Veyle] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Clanne] 
I think my pickles are pretty great, don't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Veyle] 
Hmm. The taste is quite...plain."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Clanne] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Clanne] 
I mean... Um... You really think so? I think this 
batch is nicely sour, myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
It just isn't very...potent. You should add 
a bunch of peppers."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Clanne] 
You can't make pickles with peppers."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Veyle] 
Are you sure about that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Veyle] 
I mean, is this really all a pickle can be?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Clanne] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Veyle] 
How will you ever create a new pickle recipe 
if you've already decided how pickles taste?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Clanne] 
I... OK. Yeah. I guess you're right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Clanne] 
I've just been following the same old pickle 
routine without even questioning it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Clanne] 
I must try something new if I'm ever to grow as 
a pickle chef."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Clanne] 
Lady Veyle, you've opened my eyes!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Veyle] 
That's the spirit! Now, why don't you put 
some peppers in those pickles?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Clanne] 
I think I'll do just that!"
