[Boucheron] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
Hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
Fishing is harder than it looks, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alfred] 
You got any tips? Like, is there a certain way 
I should be pulling for maximum flex?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Boucheron] 
I'm sorry, but the only thing on my mind when 
I fish is the bobber."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alfred] 
Then, how do you do it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Boucheron] 
Patience, I suppose."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alfred] 
Patience. Got it. Here I go, being patient."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alfred] 
Patient... Patient... PATIENT!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alfred] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alfred] 
I have a better idea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alfred] 
We get a big net, throw it in the water, and use 
those muscles to pull it out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alfred] 
Think of all the fish we could catch at once!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Our haul would be considerable. But what you 
suggest is less ""fishing"" than ""trawling."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alfred] 
Yeah. You got a point there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Boucheron] 
If fishing bores you, feel free to pursue your 
own activities. I won't mind."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alfred] 
Heh. Eh, you know me too well. Honestly, I've 
never been one to sit still."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alfred] 
But I don't want to give up on fishing either."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Boucheron] 
Why not, if I may ask?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alfred] 
Because it's a way to spend time with 
you, Boucheron."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Boucheron] 
I... I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alfred] 
We've always been close, but lately we haven't 
gotten much alone time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alfred] 
I'm doing my best to savor moments like this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alfred] 
So I'll sit here and keep fishing. Even if neither 
of us catches anything, that's fine with me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Boucheron] 
Heh."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Boucheron] 
You know, about my physique... I suppose I am 
just naturally muscular."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Boucheron] 
But I am glad to be gifted with such a body if it 
helps me look after you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alfred] 
Boucheron! I'm getting a tug on the line!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Boucheron] 
A big one, I'd say. Do your best not to let it 
get away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Alfred] 
I'm trying! I'm trying! But I think the line is 
about to snap!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Boucheron] 
I'll help you. We'll land this fish together!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Alfred] 
With you at my side, it's practically in the bag! 
Get set to get hooked, fishie!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Boucheron] 2 
[Alfred] 
Wakey-wakey, Boucheron! The sun is rising!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Prince Alfred? Good...good morning. Are you 
on an early patrol?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alfred] 
Nope. No patrols for me today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Then why so early?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alfred] 
I wanted to make sure I'm here to see every 
part of your day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Boucheron] 
You want to see my day? Whatever for?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alfred] 
To solve the mystery of those muscles, 
of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Boucheron] 
Come again?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alfred] 
You told me you don't do anything special to 
get that buff."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alfred] 
Which means they must come from the way you 
live your life. So that's what I'm going to watch!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Boucheron] 
All right. That makes sense...of a sort."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alfred] 
I'm glad you agree! Let's get started."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alfred] 
You just go and do what you do naturally. 
Try to forget that I'm watching everything."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Fine. If the prince doesn't mind, the first thing 
I'm doing with my day is going back to sleep."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alfred] 
Go ahead. I'll sit here and take notes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alfred] 
It's midday. Boucheron is reading a book. 
Not seeing how this is building muscle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alfred] 
The book isn't even a hardcover."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Boucheron] 
No. No! Poor little Fifi..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alfred] 
Hmm, now he's crying. What a softie."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alfred] 
I think I'm onto something here. Fishing must be 
the key to those bulging muscles!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Boucheron] 
Ha! I've got you now!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alfred] 
But that makes no sense. I sweat harder in the 
gym than he does sitting there with a pole."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Alfred] 
Sure looks like fun, though."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Alfred] 
I just don't understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Alfred] 
I watched you all day and never once saw you 
break a sweat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029,"[Boucheron] 
I'm sorry you didn't get anything out of it. 
You've wasted your whole day on me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#030,"[Alfred] 
Oh, I wouldn't call it a waste. And I got plenty 
out of it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#031,"[Alfred] 
It reminded me how nice it is to spend time 
with an old friend."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#032,"[Boucheron] 
That's kind of you to say, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#033,"[Alfred] 
The only thing I regret is that I spent all day just 
watching instead of getting in there myself!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#034,"[Boucheron] 
Haha. Well, you're welcome anytime to join in 
my daily routine. You're right─it would be fun."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Boucheron] 2 
[Alfred] 
Hmm... Nice."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Ugh... Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alfred] 
I've said it before, but I really admire those 
muscles, Boucheron."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Ugh... Oh. I appreciate the compliment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alfred] 
Your triceps are especially well developed. 
Mind if I feel them?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Boucheron] 
Uh... Anything you want, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alfred] 
Hmm, yes. Incredible stuff!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alfred] 
They're practically a Firenese national treasure. 
The forearm is perfectly sculpted too."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
Wish mine was like that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Boucheron] 
Are you finished now?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alfred] 
Oh! Guess I got carried away there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alfred] 
You gotta admit, though. These muscle 
of yours are something else."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alfred] 
I can't help but wonder what the secret is to 
getting beauties like these."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Nothing special, really."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alfred] 
Aww, that's what you always say."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alfred] 
There must be some trick to it. Unless you're 
telling me they're all-natural."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alfred] 
How is that possible?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alfred] 
Hmm... Hm, hm, hm. Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Boucheron] 
That's a bit, er..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Alfred] 
A bit what? Is there something special about 
this one?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Boucheron] 
No, Prince Alfred. It's just a bit ticklish."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Alfred] 
Oh! Well, why didn't you say so?"
