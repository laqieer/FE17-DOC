[Fogado] 
Lapis, guess what? Your device worked like 
a charm!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Fogado] 
With that thing's help, we caught every last one 
of those rogues!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
Oh, really?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Fogado] 
Yup. You did say that this device was great at 
warding off bears."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Lapis] 
Yes..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Fogado] 
It worked. That thing caused quite a stir among 
animals inhabiting the oasis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lapis] 
The animals? But we were hoping to spook the 
rogues, not the local wildlife."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Fogado] 
Well, as you can imagine, a horde of agitated 
tigers and gators sent the rogues running."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Fogado] 
As soon as they were out in the open, we 
swooped in and captured every last one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Fogado] 
It was a perfect mission, all thanks to you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lapis] 
I guess we achieved the result we wanted... 
even if the process was a little unorthodox."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Fogado] 
Pat yourself on the back. At the end of the day, 
it was well made, and it did the trick."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Fogado] 
Now tell me, do you have devices like this 
placed around your hometown?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lapis] 
Yes. We use a variety of devices to repel bears 
from my village."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Fogado] 
Yeah? How about you take me to see them 
in person?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lapis] 
Huh? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Fogado] 
I'd like to take a closer look. Bet I could learn a 
lot about creative defense strategies."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lapis] 
I'm not sure how helpful it will be."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Lapis] 
But if you do want to visit, you should wear a 
disguise so no one knows it's you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Fogado] 
All right! It's a date."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Fogado] 
Hm, what disguise should I wear? Maybe some 
bear fur?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Lapis] 
That might not be a good idea, unless you want 
to get turned into bear stew..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Fogado] 2 
[Lapis] 
Prince Fogado, look at this!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Lapis] 
I've put the finishing touches on my rogue- 
repelling device. I call it...Fogado Mark II!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Fogado] 
It's...a dummy that looks like me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lapis] 
Exactly. Turned out well, don't you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Fogado] 
Actually, yeah. In silhouette, it bears quite 
a resemblance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Lapis] 
Doesn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Fogado] 
You made all this from random scraps of trash? 
I'll admit, I'm impressed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lapis] 
I couldn't have done it without your help 
collecting materials."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lapis] 
It did take a couple tries to get right. My original 
prototype actually...exploded."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Fogado] 
I...see. So you're going to set this handsome─ 
possibly explosive─fella up at the oasis?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Lapis] 
Exactly. But it wouldn't be very effective if it 
just stood there stone-still, so..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Fogado] 
Hold up. Did it just..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Lapis] 
Yup! It moves with the wind. Nifty, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Fogado] 
Uh...yeah. Very nifty."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Fogado] 
As much as I admire the craftsmanship, do 
you really think this will scare off rogues?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lapis] 
In the right light, I think it will be quite 
intimidating."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Fogado] 
Ooo, but if they get close enough, they'll see 
that it's not real."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Lapis] 
Come to think of it, you may have a point."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Lapis] 
It's based on effigies in my hometown used to 
scare bears. I've never tested it on people."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Fogado] 
You know what? It's worth a shot. I can't say 
I have any better ideas."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Lapis] 
All right, then. Hopefully it does the trick!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Fogado] 
Ah... What am I going to do?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
About what, Prince Fogado?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Fogado] 
Oh! Hey, Lapis. You know I'm in charge of the 
Sentinels, yeah?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Fogado] 
We've got a real thorn in our side. A group of 
rogues making trouble by an oasis in Solm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Fogado] 
They're a slippery bunch. Even with our 
numbers, we can't stamp them out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lapis] 
Have you considered making a device that will 
get rid of the rogues for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lapis] 
You know─something that can drive them off 
without you having to lift a finger."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Fogado] 
Hm, not a bad idea. But I don't know anyone 
who could make something like that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lapis] 
Me, of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Fogado] 
You?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Lapis] 
I'm pretty crafty. Ever since I was young, I've 
been able to make everything I needed."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lapis] 
So...yeah! I bet I could whip something up."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Fogado] 
All right... Let's give it a whirl. Tell me if you 
need any materials."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lapis] 
See if you can find any trash or tree branches 
lying around. That ought to do it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Fogado] 
What? Really?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lapis] 
Yeah! The sooner you get that stuff, the sooner 
those rogues will be out of your hair."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Fogado] 
Um, all right. I'll go trawling for...anything that 
looks useful, then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Fogado] 
Me? Desperate? No, I'm just trying to solve 
my problems with a big pile of trash..."
