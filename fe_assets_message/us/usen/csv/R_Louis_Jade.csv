MID_RELIANCE_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Jade] 2 

[Jade] 
Hey, Louis? There's something I wanted to ask 
you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Louis] 
And what might that be, good knight?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Jade] 
Why are you trying to get close to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jade] 
You've been watching me for a while. And you 
threw me off balance with your story idea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Louis] 
Mm."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jade] 
Have you ever encountered a spy? The best 
ones use fast-talk to steal information."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jade] 
They carefully cultivate a sense of trust, then 
strike while their target's guard is down."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Jade] 
We're allies, but you're still a soldier from 
Firene. I have to wonder."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Louis] 
Very impressive, Jade."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Jade] 
Ah, so my hunch was right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Louis] 
Oh no, it was wide off the mark. I am no spy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jade] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Louis] 
What I found impressive was your imagination."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Louis] 
It takes a deep wellspring of inventiveness and a 
way with words to pen such captivating stories."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Jade] 
Don't dodge the question. Why were you 
watching me earlier?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Louis] 
Why, because I wanted to get to know you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Jade] 
That's all?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Louis] 
It is indeed that simple."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Louis] 
I observed you only in order to hit upon 
a suitable conversation starter."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Louis] 
I see it as crucial that we connect. We come 
from disparate countries with different values."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Louis] 
Yet we must put these differences aside and 
risk our lives daily in combat together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Louis] 
In order to facilitate this, it is vital that we come 
to understand one another."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Jade] 
That does make sense."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Jade] 
It would be better for us to understand and 
trust each other out there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Louis] 
Just so. These bonds we make now will last, 
even after the war."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Jade] 
I apologize for...assuming your intentions, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Jade] 
I could spare some time to get to know you a 
bit better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Louis] 
In that case, shall we sit and chat over a pot of 
my favorite tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Jade] 
I'd like that, Louis─as long as I can take notes 
on awkward conversation for my book."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Jade] 2 

[Jade] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Louis] 
Here's a story idea: a group of close friends 
convene and have a lively conversation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Jade] 
What are you talking about?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Louis] 
I saw consternation on your face and thought 
you might be struggling for ideas."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jade] 
No use hiding it at this point, is there?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Jade] 
You're right. I'm trying to land on the theme of 
my next novel."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Louis] 
Well, there you have it. Write a story about 
a close-knit circle of friends."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Jade] 
How close? Do you mean a story where a circle 
of friends navigate a shared experience?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Louis] 
If you like, but I would be thoroughly satisfied 
just to read about them chit-chatting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Jade] 
You think I should write an entire novel about 
friends having polite, everyday conversations?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Louis] 
Without question, it shall be your finest work."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Jade] 
Louis, most of my novels have been built 
around this thing I call a plot..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Louis] 
Counter-argument: is plot more important than 
memorable scenes?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jade] 
Hmm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Louis] 
""Enter late, leave early,"" they say. An enjoyable 
scene justifies itself without ""plot"" scaffolding."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Jade] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Jade] 
The story idea is too simple, but that sort of flat 
narrative structure is a joke worth exploring..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Jade] 
Huh, I think you just helped me crack this egg. 
Thank you, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Louis] 
I'm pleased to be of assistance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Louis] 
I have high hopes to read your vivid rendering 
of our characters' spirited conversations."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Jade] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Louis] 
Oh dear, you're tight-lipped again. Is something 
else troubling you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Jade] 
No, Louis. That was my laugh."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Jade] 
You are so blatant that it's genuinely funny."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Louis] 
Haha, your eye for comedy is indeed 
impeccable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Jade] 2 

[Jade] 
Louis...you've been staring at me for a troubling 
amount of time. Do you need something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Louis] 
Good knight of Brodia, please pardon any 
offense I have caused."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Louis] 
My profound interest in you drives me to act in 
perhaps inadvisable ways."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Jade] 
You call staring an ""interest""?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Louis] 
You carry out each mission with such grace, 
and never question an order from your prince."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Louis] 
Moreover, you are so merciless in battle that 
some might unfairly deem you to be inhuman."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Jade] 
Ah. We seem to be well beyond ""interest"" now. 
Are you trying to be cute?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jade] 
If you think I'm dangerous, I won't argue. I don't 
completely trust you either."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Louis] 
Dangerous? Not at all. I fear I've once again 
given you the wrong idea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Louis] 
But it's undeniable that there are certain things 
you keep carefully concealed, yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Louis] 
Secrets that only a select few are privy to."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Jade] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Louis] 
But I know all about them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Jade] 
I have no idea what you're talking about."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Louis] 
You have a new novel in the works, don't you? 
A comedy that is frivolous in the extreme?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jade] 
Louis, I'm sure I didn't hear you mention a new 
book just now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Louis] 
Please. I am a paragon of discretion."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Jade] 
Oh, I believe you will be. You already know well 
enough to describe me as merciless."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Jade] 
Take a break from your ""interests"" and enjoy a 
long, natural life of minding your own business."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Louis] 
Very good, Jade. I shall take that under 
advisement."
