[Goldmary] 
Have a look at this, Vander."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Vander] 
I see you have made good use of my lace. 
That is a fine accessory."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if your craftsmanship is overshadowed 
by my grace in wearing it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Vander] 
You have no shortage of self-esteem, 
I must say."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Goldmary] 
I'll take that as a compliment."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Vander] 
I suppose you should. Confidence is a good 
trait. You have the right attitude."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Goldmary] 
Thank you very much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Goldmary] 
If it's not too much trouble, Vander..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Goldmary] 
Could I ask something of you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Vander] 
What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Goldmary] 
You said knitting is a way to occupy your hands 
while your mind does its work."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Goldmary] 
I wonder if you'd like to...put some of that work 
toward me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Vander] 
How do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Goldmary] 
I'm asking you to teach me how to knit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Goldmary] 
I think it would make a wonderful addition 
to my ever-broadening array of talents."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Vander] 
Grant me the patience... I have no idea how 
I ever perceived you as humble."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Goldmary] 
Am I asking for too much? I'm sorry..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Vander] 
I shall teach you what I know. I am interested 
to see what you can do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Goldmary] 
Oh, thank you. I really appreciate it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Goldmary] 
In return, of course, you'll have the pleasure 
of my scintillating conversation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Goldmary] 
Before long you'll be wondering how you ever 
managed to do all that knitting alone."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Vander] 
Haha, you really are something else."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Vander] 
Your confidence comes paired with a brazen 
tongue. You simply say whatever you think."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Vander] 
Yet it is a trait that does make conversation 
with you enjoyable, I must admit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Vander] 
Very well. It is always nice to talk. Perhaps we 
will have a good bit of fun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Goldmary] 
I'm confident we will."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Hello, Vander."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Vander] 
Whatever you need, I am sure it can wait until 
I've finished my knitting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Goldmary] 
I just wanted to thank you again for fixing my 
sleeve the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Vander] 
I happened to be passing by. Anyone else in my 
position would have done the same."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Goldmary] 
Mmm, but you were the one who stopped to 
help me, so it's you who gets my thanks."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Goldmary] 
May I ask what it is you're working on?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Vander] 
Lace. I do not know what will become of it yet. 
I will sort that out when it's done."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sure you could make all kinds of accessories 
that would accentuate my natural charisma."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Vander] 
An accessory. Good idea."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Goldmary] 
I admire you, Vander. You're strong, but you 
also have a delicate touch. I think that's lovely."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Vander] 
I was attendant to Queen Lumera for a 
long time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Vander] 
The job required me to be proficient in sewing, 
cooking, cleaning...all manner of housework."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Goldmary] 
I consider housework to be among my greatest 
skills, but you may actually have me beat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Goldmary] 
With all your talents, I imagine you were quite 
the charmer in your youth."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Vander] 
Not particularly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Vander] 
I was far too devoted to my vocation to have 
time for that sort of thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Goldmary] 
I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Vander] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Vander] 
If I give this to you, will you go on your way?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Goldmary] 
You're offering me the lace?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Goldmary] 
Thank you, but I wouldn't want to deprive the 
person it's intended for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Vander] 
It is not intended for anyone. I only knit to 
occupy my hands while my mind does its work."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
AHH!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Vander] 
Goldmary! What has happened?! Are you 
all right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Goldmary] 
My poor clothes... I must have torn my sleeve 
on that tree back there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Vander] 
You...tore your sleeve."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Vander] 
From the sound of it, I thought you were under 
attack. I came rushing for nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Goldmary] 
I'm so sorry to alarm you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Goldmary] 
My piercing cry must have struck your ears like 
the ringing of gilded trumpets."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Goldmary] 
But at least now you're here to help me through 
this ordeal. What should I do?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Vander] 
What a sad state you are in."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Vander] 
All right. Show me the sleeve."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Goldmary] 
What for?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Vander] 
So I can see the tear. Do you want my help 
or not?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Goldmary] 
I'll have to get my sewing kit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Vander] 
I will use mine. This should take but a moment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Goldmary] 
Oh, you have your own?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Vander] 
Is that so strange?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Goldmary] 
No, not at all. I'm very impressed, actually."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Vander] 
Come on, then. Show me the tear. I do have 
other tasks to complete today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Goldmary] 
Thank you so much."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Vander] 
Remember though, this is only a mend and not 
a repair."
