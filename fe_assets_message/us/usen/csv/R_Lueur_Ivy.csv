[Alear] 
Ivy, can I ask why you call me your deity?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Ivy] 
During all the hardest moments of my life, the 
one thing I could turn to was the Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
My faith in you gave me strength to survive."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Survive what, exactly?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Ivy] 
My whole world─the place where I was born."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Ivy] 
Elusia Castle is a den of treachery and 
double-dealing. No one is safe there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Ivy] 
And the worst part is...I had no escape."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Ivy] 
My mother was at the center of every scheme. 
I was forced to be near every foul conspiracy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
Your own mother..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Ivy] 
In her world, every smile is a dagger looking for 
a back to stab."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Ivy] 
I hated that place. I hated what it did to 
everyone who set foot there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Ivy] 
The one thing that kept me from despair was 
my faith─my faith in the Divine Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
But why me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Ivy] 
At first I worshipped merely to be contrary. 
They chose the Fell Dragon, so I chose Divine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Ivy] 
It was a small, invisible act of rebellion. But it 
was what I needed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Ivy] 
The more I thought about you and your life, 
the more I knew I didn't belong in the castle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
I'm glad to have been some help, if only 
indirectly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Ivy] 
Ah, forgive me─to experience your kindness in 
such a familiar way is an intense thing for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Ivy] 
Could you please act a little more like a deity?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
Heh, understood. I'll try to be more considerate."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Ivy] 
In all seriousness, Divine One..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Ivy] 
You are my strength, even now. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Ivy] 2 

[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
Ivy, do you think maybe it's time we talked?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
Whatever you're feeling toward me, I'm 
prepared to listen."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
As allies, I'd like there not to be walls 
between us."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Ivy] 
Very well."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Ivy] 
I am rather more comfortable around you now, 
so...I suppose it's time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
I'm glad to hear that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
Can we start with why you seem to have such 
anger toward me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Ivy] 
I love you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Ivy] 
I love you, Divine One. My feelings began long 
before I met you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Ivy] 
Understand, I...do not mean romantically. 
I adore you as a worshipper adores a deity."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
But...you looked so upset when you were 
staring at me before."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Ivy] 
My deity was standing before me, in the flesh. 
I was nervous."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Ivy] 
Do you understand now?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
Yes, um... Thank you for sharing that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
I, um, like you as well, Ivy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Ivy] 
Yes..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Ivy] 
May I be excused?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alear] 
Oh. Yes. Yes, of course. And..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alear] 
And...I'm sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Ivy] 
We'll speak again later, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Ivy] 2 

[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Oh, Ivy. Did you need something from me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Ivy] 
No, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Ivy] 
Must I require something to remain near you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
No, it's not that..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Ivy] 
I see. Then please feel free to ignore me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
I would, but...it's difficult to ignore the anger 
on your face."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
The kingdom of Elusia worships the Fell 
Dragon, doesn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
If that's the case, I can certainly see why you 
would feel uncomfortable around me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Ivy] 
You can't imagine how I feel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
If you can explain it, I'd love to understand."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
It might reduce this...distance between us."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Ivy] 
True."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Ivy] 
But we should...get used to each other first. 
We'll talk when we're...more comfortable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Ivy] 
For now, I will leave you be..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Ivy] 
and worship from afar."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alear] 
Worship?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Ivy] 2 

[Ivy] 
This is where you wanted to meet, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Ivy] 
Why all the way out here? What could you 
possibly be planning?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
I have something important to talk to you about."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Ivy] 
That doesn't explain why you picked this place. 
I would happily speak with you anywhere."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
I wanted to be alone with you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Ivy] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Ivy] 
Well, here we are."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
Are you OK? You're blushing."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Ivy] 
I am? Of course I am."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Ivy] 
It's all right. Whatever you have to say to me, 
I am prepared to hear it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Ivy] 
Proceed."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
Very well."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
Princess Ivy, please accept this ring as a token 
of my favor."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Ivy] 
That's the Pact Ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Ivy] 
The Divine Dragon bestows this gift only to 
deepen the most meaningful bond."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
Knowledgeable as ever."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Ivy] 
You're really giving this to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
There is no one I would rather have by my side."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
You are the one I feel closest to."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Ivy] 
I am, as ever, in awe of how forthright you are 
with your feelings."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
I wouldn't be a very good deity if I hid my 
thoughts from someone so devoted to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
You opened your heart to me, Ivy. It's only fair 
I return the favor."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Ivy] 
That's true."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Ivy] 
Very well. In that case, I accept."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
Good."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Ivy] 
I already feel so much closer to you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Ivy] 
A bond with the Divine Dragon is more than I 
ever dared hope for. Thank you, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Ivy] 
Now and forever, you have my endless 
devotion and adoration."
