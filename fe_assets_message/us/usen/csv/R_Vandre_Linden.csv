[Vander] 
Sir Lindon. How has your work on rejuvenation 
magic gone since last we spoke?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Lindon] 
Haha, the experiment failed dismally."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
I chalk it up to an error in the tome that first 
piqued my interest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lindon] 
A spell to restore lost youth sounded too good 
to be true, and so it was."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Vander] 
I see. How unfortunate."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Lindon] 
Honestly, I found myself a little relieved."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Vander] 
Why is that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Lindon] 
""I have been rewarded in experience."" 
""The world needs mentors."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lindon] 
As I set up my experiments, I recalled many 
times what you'd said to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Lindon] 
In my younger days, I learned so much of what 
I knew from the guidance of my elders."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lindon] 
The idea of a world without such mentors in 
it began to frighten me a bit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Lindon] 
Then, too, growing older and losing my skills as 
a knight taught me a few things."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Lindon] 
Perhaps it's only at our age that we become 
capable of filling those roles."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Vander] 
Ah, you have finally seen the light."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Vander] 
A shame there was no one to drill such sense 
into the scribe of that failed spell tome."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lindon] 
The error was quite shocking when I realized. 
Still, I reaped a bit of an unintended benefit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Vander] 
Oh? Do tell."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lindon] 
Do you notice anything, looking at me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Vander] 
Hmm. You do seem a tad more sprightly than 
when we last crossed paths."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Lindon] 
Very perceptive!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lindon] 
In the course of my work, I did discover a minor 
ritual that helped ease my back pain."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Lindon] 
Thanks to that, I feel fit as a fiddle!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Vander] 
Is this true?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lindon] 
Do I detect a hint of interest? Has a certain 
someone's back been bothering him?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Vander] 
I was reluctant to admit it, but yes. You have 
the right of it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Lindon] 
Well then! Stay very still, Vander, and I'll 
prepare the ritual for you as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Lindon] 
After all, mentoring the younger generations 
will be easier if you're in shape for it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Vander] 
Leave it to an Elusian sage to find success 
even in failure."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Lindon] 
You flatter me, sir. Now, let's show those fresh- 
faced soldiers what a few old fogies can do!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Vander] 
Problems, Sir Lindon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lindon] 
I've found a very intriguing tome."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lindon] 
With what's in here, I may be able to develop 
a whole new type of magic."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Vander] 
That does sound interesting. What sort 
of magic?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Lindon] 
You won't believe this, but it's a spell to restore 
one's youth."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Vander] 
Surely such a spell could not actually exist. 
Could it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lindon] 
It's still theoretical for now. I can't promise I'll 
get results even if I work out the particulars."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lindon] 
But if I succeed, we could fight just as ably as 
our young comrades."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Lindon] 
I'm no slouch even as I am, but if I had my 
youth back, I'd be a terror on the battlefield."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Lindon] 
And never mind the war─magic like this would 
change society as we know it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lindon] 
If I make any headway here, I promise that 
you'll be first in line for the spell."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Vander] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Vander] 
What you describe is a dream come true. 
Yet I believe I shall decline."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lindon] 
Why's that? Don't you want your lost 
youth back?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Vander] 
I said before, I am satisfied to do what I can 
with the body I have."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Vander] 
I pass on what I have learned to younger folk. 
The world needs mentors as much as warriors."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Lindon] 
Huh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Lindon] 
All right, all right. I commend you for sticking 
by your principles."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Lindon] 
But if my work pans out, I wager you'll be 
singing a different tune."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Lindon] 
Hm-hm, I suppose we'll see, won't we?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Vander] 
Sir Lindon? Is something troubling you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Lindon] 
I'm loath to admit it, but my lower back has 
been giving me terrible pain lately."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Lindon] 
For all my training as a royal knight of Elusia, 
I suppose there's no defeating old age."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Vander] 
What nonsense. You are a sage of no small 
talent. I would say you haven't lost a step."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lindon] 
You're right that my mind is as sharp as ever, 
but physically, my decline has been just dismal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lindon] 
You're no spring chicken yourself, you know. 
Can you really say you're as fit as ever?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Vander] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Vander] 
I will not pretend that I still have the stamina 
nor the reflexes of my prime."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Vander] 
But what I have lost in that regard, I have been 
rewarded in experience."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Vander] 
Nothing is gained moaning about your age. 
Do what you can with the body you have."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lindon] 
Haha, very astute! I should take a page from 
your book."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Lindon] 
I may be getting on in years, but damned if I'll 
let the youth run rings around me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Vander] 
There you go, Sir Lindon. Well said."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Lindon] 
Part of me wants to rest and relax in my 
twilight years."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lindon] 
But you've convinced me to squeeze just a little 
more blood from this aging stone."
