[Fogado] 
Pandreo, I am ready to make a confession."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Pandreo] 
OK, I'm ready. What do you wish to confess?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
You see, I...I lied to my friend. To you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Fogado] 
It's...the war, Pandreo. I'm not sure we can win. 
Our enemies are getting stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Fogado] 
I'm so worried for the future I can barely sleep."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Fogado] 
The other day, when I told you I was distracted 
because of the party? That was a lie."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Fogado] 
I just...couldn't stop thinking a-about...all the 
people who could die on my watch."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Pandreo] 
Aw, buddy..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Fogado] 
I'm not the happy-go-lucky guy you think I am."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Fogado] 
I know it's my job to keep a smile on. I just... 
I'm so damn scared, Pandreo."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Pandreo] 
I appreciate you telling me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Fogado] 
Only after pulling the wool over your eyes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Nah, don't flatter yourself. I saw right 
through it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Fogado] 
You did?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Pandreo] 
Of course. How gullible do you think I am? 
I can tell when my friend's feeling blue."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Pandreo] 
I'm not a prince, so I won't pretend I can fix it, 
or that I really know what you're feeling."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Pandreo] 
But what I can do is promise that I'll always 
support you. As your retainer and your friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Pandreo] 
So, don't worry. Uh, let me rephrase that. Worry 
to your heart's content. I'll still be here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Fogado] 
That's all I need."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Pandreo] 
Good. Because at the end of the day, that's all 
I can offer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Fogado] 
Ah, that's strange... My vision's gone blurry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Pandreo] 
Hey, hey, hey. Crying's not allowed, you hear? 
Because if you do, I'm gonna."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Fogado] 
No, I'm not crying. Not quite, at least."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Pandreo] 
Ah, whew."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Pandreo] 
You know, this reminds me. It was during a 
confession you told me you were the prince."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Fogado] 
That's right. I used to go to your parents' 
church all the time. You and I were fast friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Pandreo] 
And then you dropped that on me. Easily one of 
my top five most interesting confessions."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Pandreo] 
I almost forgot to breathe─I was so shocked."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Fogado] 
Well, you were looking for Panette. I had to tell 
you she'd become my sister's retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Fogado] 
And if you didn't know I was the prince, you 
wouldn't have bought it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Pandreo] 
And the next thing you said was even more 
shocking. You turned to me and asked..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Fogado] 
How's a job as my retainer sound?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Pandreo] 
That's right. Ah, that brings me back. The seven 
most beautiful words I've ever heard."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Pandreo] 
And as your retainer, I'm not just here for the 
highs, all right? I'm here for the lows too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Pandreo] 
Whether you need a buddy on the dance floor 
or a shoulder to cry on, I can be that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Fogado] 
Thank you, Pandreo."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038,"[Fogado] 
I gotta say, I'm gladder than ever that I was so 
honest in my confession back then."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Good going back there! Those guys were 
pretty tough."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Fogado] 
Yep, they were."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Whaddaya say we celebrate the win by partying 
till we can't see straight?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Fogado] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Pandreo] 
Uh... Something wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Fogado] 
Sorry, Pandreo, but I'm gonna take a rain check."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Pandreo] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Pandreo] 
No, no. My ears must be playing tricks on me. 
Fogado turning down a party?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Pandreo] 
What's going on? You eat something that's not 
agreeing with you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Fogado] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Fogado] 
Ha, just kidding! Heh heh... You should have 
seen the look on your face."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Pandreo] 
Aw, man! You really had me going there."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Fogado] 
Haha, sorry. Thought it would be fun to mess 
with you a little bit."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Geez! Breaking a guy's heart─you call that fun?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Fogado] 
Pandreo, before I forget... Will you hear my 
confession soon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Pandreo] 
Better not be another cruel prank. Fool me 
once, et cetera."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Pandreo] 
As long as you promise not to yank my chain 
again...of course I'll hear your confession."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Fogado] 
Thanks, Pandreo. I appreciate it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Well, that's over and done with! Was that easy 
or was that easy?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Those losers thought they were tough, but we 
showed them, eh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Pandreo] 
AROOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Fogado] 
Uh, yeah. Aroo..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, come on!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Fogado] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Pandreo] 
You're bumming me out here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Fogado] 
Oh, sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Pandreo] 
""Oh, sorry."" Give me a break!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Lighten up. Seeing you down in the dumps like 
this freaks me out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Pandreo] 
Let's dance it out, come on! Arf! Arf, arf, arf!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Fogado] 
Ruff... Rawr... Rawr..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Ugh, no!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Now I know something's up. What happened? 
Bunet leave a hair in your chowder?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Fogado] 
Sorry. I was just thinking."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Pandreo] 
About?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Fogado] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Fogado] 
The party."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Pandreo] 
What?! That's why you're so distracted?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Fogado] 
Yeah. I just can't wait to tear up that 
dance floor."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Pandreo] 
Aw, yeah! There's the prince of parties I know 
and love!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Pandreo] 
Come on. Let's get you to that bash before 
you pass out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Fogado] 
Woo. Can't wait to...party down."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Pandreo] 
Same! AROOO!"
