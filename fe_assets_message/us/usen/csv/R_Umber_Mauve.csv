[Amber] 
Mauvier! Buddy! Guard duty AGAIN? You can't 
be stopped, can you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
How is your stomach treating you today?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Amber] 
Oh, that? Haha, it's doing OK. How about you? 
Not feeling tired anymore?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
As I always say, do not worry about me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Amber] 
Man, you are such a trooper."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Amber] 
Does it ever...bother you? That you worked for 
the enemy before this, I mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Mauvier] 
What you are asking is best left undiscussed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Amber] 
I knew it. Guilt is totally your thing, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Mauvier] 
It would be a lie to say otherwise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Mauvier] 
It is a simple task to make others lose faith in 
you. Earning it back is far more difficult."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Amber] 
Oh! That's why you've been putting in so much 
hard work!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Amber] 
You don't have to worry. Everybody knows 
you're on our side now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Mauvier] 
Only because you tell everyone that I work hard 
and am dedicated to the cause."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Amber] 
Huh?! H-how did you know that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Mauvier] 
It is not difficult to hear what people are talking 
about when our numbers are so small."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Amber] 
I guess we both found each other out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Mauvier] 
It is strange how I find myself in a better mood 
when you are around."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Mauvier] 
When I see you, I always know I am in the 
presence of a friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Amber] 
That tracks. A lot of people say my affability 
is my only redeeming quality."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Mauvier] 
Haha, is that what they say?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Amber] 
Pretty much. I guess we hadn't really talked to 
each other before these last few nights, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Amber] 
There's still plenty of time before dawn breaks. 
Wanna chat?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Mauvier] 
Yes. That sounds like good fun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Amber] 
OK! Affable Amber's gonna make you smile till 
sunup! If, uh, my rowdy guts let me, that is. Oof."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Hm-hm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Hey, Mauvier. On guard duty again today? 
Want some company?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Mauvier] 
And how is your pulled muscle treating you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Amber] 
Haha, that was no big deal. Heh, I healed up in 
no time!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Mauvier] 
I see. That's g─ Ngh...good."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Amber] 
Mauvier?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Mauvier] 
Do not worry. I am fine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Amber] 
That didn't sound like ""fine."" Sit down. I'll go 
grab some water!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Amber] 
How's that? Better?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Mauvier] 
Yes, thanks to you. I suppose I was a little tired 
after all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Amber] 
Haha, I knew it. I'm honestly relieved to hear 
you admit it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Mauvier] 
Hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Amber] 
That means you're human after all! I had my 
doubts. Stop pushing yourself so hard, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Mauvier] 
Haha, I surrender to your concerns."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Amber] 
Yeah, you do. Here, drink some of this. It's a 
legendary secret potion that relieves fatigue."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Mauvier] 
Really? Hm. This smell is worrisome."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Amber] 
Worrisome? What?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Mauvier] 
This is no secret potion to help with fatigue. 
It is a laxative."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Amber] 
Huh? No way!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Mauvier] 
Where did you come by that bottle? I nearly 
took a drink."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Amber] 
Yeah, close call. Haha... Ah... Hah..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Mauvier] 
What is wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Amber] 
I may have, um...taste-tested it earlier..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Mauvier] 
Hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Amber] 
Ah! Oh no! It's working─I can feel it WORKING!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Mauvier] 
So, once again, it is you who needs to take a 
break while I continue guard duty."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Mauvier] 
Go and rest. I will return to my watch."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Amber] 
Please... Don't tell Jade..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Amber] 
Mauvier? Are you still on guard duty? It's so 
late! I'll take over so you can get some rest."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Mauvier] 
There is no need. The lateness of the hour is 
not of any concern."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Amber] 
Really? Wow. I've gotta hand it to you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Mauvier] 
Why is that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Amber] 
You've been standing at attention for who 
knows how long! Don't you need a break?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Mauvier] 
Keeping guard is more important than resting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Amber] 
Whoa! You can't say that! You've gotta take a 
real break!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Mauvier] 
There is no need. Resting is a waste of time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Amber] 
OK, you're starting to scare me. How do you 
shake off your fatigue?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Mauvier] 
Fatigue is no issue."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Amber] 
What? What are you, one of the Corrupted 
or something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Amber] 
Enough joking around. It's my shift, so I'll take 
over from here. For real."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Mauvier] 
No, thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Amber] 
Oh, come on, man! I didn't want to do this, but 
I'll have to relieve you by force..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Amber] 
Urgh!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Mauvier] 
What is wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Amber] 
I think...I pulled...a muscle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Mauvier] 
Heh, it looks like you're the one who needs 
to rest."
