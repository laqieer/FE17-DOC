[Eirika] 2 
[Alfred] 
Emblems are weird. You're right here in front 
of me, but you don't have a body."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
Your will is so strong that you don't need one. 
Guess that's what it takes to be an Emblem."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
I'm not so certain. I'd consider myself a novice 
and not much stronger than you."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
When I see how hard you drive yourself, it spurs 
me to do my all to match."
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Is it not hard for you to rise before daybreak? 
To undergo a morning routine while still sleepy?"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
Once, maybe, but I'm used to it. Mornings are 
better when you've got your game face on!"
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You're always so lively in the mornings. The 
mere sight of it is enough to fill me with energy."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Alfred] 
Yeah, I can have that effect on people! Wanna 
come running with me sometime?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Just browsing through your dazzling array of 
wares is enough to brighten my mood."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Anna] 
Great! Look all you want! For you, Eirika, 
my stall is always open."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
That's nice of you. But are you sure it's not a 
problem that I can't buy anything?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Anna] 
Nah. Just between us, I'm raking in the dough 
from all the customers coming to see you!"
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You always have such interesting items for sale. 
If only I could purchase any of them."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Anna] 
I normally frown on window shoppers, but if it 
makes you happy, I'd be willing to let it slide."
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Anna] 
Ooo, a pretty Emblem! Welcome to my shop. 
I've got all kinds of rare stuff for sale!"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
I came to see your wares, but something about 
you feels very familiar."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Bunet] 
So, you can't sense flavors with your eyes? 
A shame. I so wanted you to taste my cooking."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
I wanted that too. But I have an idea..."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
I will watch you cook, paying attention to every 
detail. And I will imagine how each bite tastes."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Bunet] 
Use the power of imagination...to conjure the 
soul of a meal? A delicious experiment indeed."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Bunet] 
Eirika, please, as you can sense flavor with 
your eyes, tell me... How does this dish taste?"
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Oh! I only meant I can see your food is delicious 
because I can see people smile when they eat it."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Your cooking looks truly delicious, Bunet. I can 
almost taste it just by looking at it."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Bunet] 
You can tell a dish's flavor from a single look? 
Splendid! How I envy those eyes of yours."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I'd like to take up reading as a hobby. But not 
being able to turn the pages is an issue."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Well, if there's a book you want to read, I'd be 
happy to turn the pages for you."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
Thank you! I'm curious about Elyos, so a history 
book would be nice. Or is that too long?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Boucheron] 
No sweat. These muscles of mine could power 
through a thousand pages if they had to."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Do you read much, Eirika? I like it because it 
puts you in someone else's shoes."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
If everyone read as much as you do, I don't 
doubt the world would be a kinder place."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I admire your form, Boucheron. I wish I had 
muscles like yours."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
What?! I don't know, Eirika. I've seen you fight, 
and you do just fine the way you are."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I can tell from the scent alone that your tea 
is magnificent, Céline."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Céline] 
You honor me. As a princess, it's important for 
me to establish a welcoming atmosphere."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
There's more to it than manners and etiquette, 
isn't there? You wear your heart in your leaves."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Céline] 
I learned from your example. There is joy in 
seeing signs that someone else cares for us."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
War takes a heavy mental toll. We must not 
forget to care for those scarred by combat."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Céline] 
I find that the soothing aroma of a floral tea 
does much to calm the mind. I'll prepare a pot."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Céline] 
They tell me you dislike conflict, Eirika. Is it not 
painful for you to wage war as an Emblem?"
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
I've made up my mind to do whatever I can if it 
stops even one person from grieving."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Chloé] 
Eirika, all I meant was that one of you is already 
beautiful. Two of you would be even lovelier!"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
I had heard that you appreciated storybook 
scenes of that sort. And since we're twins..."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
You'd look even dreamier side by side! The 
trouble is, he only shows himself in battle."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
True enough. I know you had your heart set on 
it, but I think you and I match up nicely too."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Chloé] 
Your brother's so wonderful, Eirika. He's as 
gorgeous as you and every bit as strong too."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
I'm sure he appreciates the compliments. Wait... 
Chloé, are you..."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Chloé] 
Um, Eirika? Who is that beautiful man who 
shows up sometimes and looks just like you?"
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
That's my twin brother, Ephraim. Sorry if he 
surprised you, but he's impressed with you too."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I've given it plenty of thought, Citrinne...and I've 
landed on a gift idea that I would truly love."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, that's marvelous! I'm so glad! Tell me, what 
expression of our friendship shall I buy for you?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
What I would cherish most...is the knowledge 
that you care for me. And I already have that."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, Eirika... If that's a gift, then you've given it 
right back to me. Let's both cherish it together."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Citrinne] 
There must be some gift I can offer you, Eirika. 
Shall I buy you a mountain? Rent out the coast?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Um, those would both be a bit much, but I can 
sense your sincerity. Let me think it over."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I love to treat friends to little gifts. What can I 
get for you, Eirika? Say the word and it's yours."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
Hehe, you're so kind, Citrinne. For now, the 
offer on its own is more than enough."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Clanne] 
Twins are strange, right? We're born at the 
same time, but one is always older."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
My brother always uses the excuse that he's 
older so he can do things for me."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
He says being younger means getting doted on, 
even if I was born at nearly the same time."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
If he's anything like me, he's showing you how 
much he loves his twin."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
My twin brother has always treated me like a 
child, even though I was born shortly after him."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
Oh yeah? Wow. I'm the older one and I always 
worry about my sister too."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Clanne] 
Wow, you're a twin too, Lady Eirika?"
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
Yes! Just like you, we're an older brother and 
younger sister. We should compare experiences."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Diamant] 
My father taught me to control through power. 
Now I'm crown prince of a military juggernaut."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
I also had a military-minded father, so I decided 
to train in the combat arts."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
I will be honest, I take no pleasure from drawing 
a sword, but sometimes there's no other choice."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Diamant] 
I agree. Power must be used to protect people... 
but it must also protect the peace that follows."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You've been the heir to your throne since birth, 
haven't you, Diamant? How has that felt?"
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Diamant] 
Matters of the crown are always on my mind... 
but I make sure my heart gives the orders."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Diamant] 
I heard you have a twin brother, Eirika. Did that 
ever complicate the matter of succession?"
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
Not at all. I never planned to challenge my older 
brother. There is no one more suited to be king."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I must say, Etie. The idea of working out as a 
way of life has opened my mind."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Etie] 
The best part is you really get results going 
about it that way!"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Etie] 
Still, you've gotta focus on the process, not the 
results. Wanna give it a try sometime, Eirika?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
I'd like that. If I see things your way, I think 
I could train hard while having fun doing it!"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You're always so keenly focused on training. 
Do you wish for greater strength that badly?"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Etie] 
Getting buff isn't the only reason to work out. 
It's like...a whole way of life at this point."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Etie] 
You seem a little sluggish. You feeling OK? 
A good, hard workout might be what you need."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
Sorry? Oh, no, I was just lost in thought. I can't 
always be as ebullient as you, Etie."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Fogado] 
Princes have a lot of expectations to live up to, 
ya know? Sometimes it feels so...so confining."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
I think people expect great things from you 
because they can see just how brilliant you are."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
Well, when you put it like that, I think maybe I 
should work harder to meet those expectations."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
That is a good attitude. Though don't forget, 
your relaxed nature is a good quality too."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Fogado] 
So, about that guy who helps you in battle...is 
he a friend of yours? I'd love to chat with him."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
You mean my twin brother, Ephraim? I'm sorry. 
He vanishes every time a battle ends."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Fogado] 
I admit, Eirika, I had no idea you were so strong! 
I guess looks can be deceiving, eh?"
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
My brother has trained me well. As for you, it 
seems you are just as friendly as you appear."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Framme] 
Does your brother annoy you, Lady Eirika? Or 
do you just totally love him? You can tell me."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
I love him, of course. He is family."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
But more than that, he is the person I trust and 
respect the most. And that will never change."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Framme] 
That's sweet. I feel the same. I should probably 
tell my brother, but it sounds sooo mushy."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Framme] 
Lady Eirika, do you get along with your 
brother? Sometimes it's hard for twins."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
We do, though I cannot say if it is thanks to our 
personalities or the nature of our power."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Framme] 
No way! You're a twin like me? And a younger 
twin sister too? We're gonna get along so good."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
Hehe, I'm sure you're right. Perhaps we can 
trade tips on how best to handle older brothers!"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Our talk has had me trying to remember when 
I last had a good bath."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I imagine it's difficult without a body. Taking 
you to the hot springs might be a little pointless."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Then again, you may not need a body to 
appreciate how relaxing they can be."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
Interesting suggestion. We should pay your 
village a visit when we get the chance."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I grew up surrounded by luxurious hot springs, 
so I appreciate a good soak more than most."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Hot springs must be amazing. I wonder if there 
are any such places in the world I come from?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I often wonder why war is so commonplace. 
Why are people so keen to hurt each other?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I couldn't agree more. It should be a crime to 
force anyone as charming as us to fight."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Hortensia] 
I think it's about time someone acknowledged 
how pretty and charming you are, Eirika!"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
What do you mean by ""acknowledged""?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
I mean this─an official certificate of beauty! 
We can hang it up for you somewhere."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
This is certainly a first. Thank you, Hortensia. 
Can we display it in the Ring Chamber?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Hey, Eirika. When was the last time someone 
told you that you're totally adorable?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
I have no idea. I'm certainly not used to hearing 
such things. Maybe when I was a little girl?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I'm very grateful to your retainers for bringing 
me here."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Hortensia] 
I'm the one who should be grateful. It's a 
privilege to fight alongside you."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Ivy] 
I suppose it's natural for each of us to envy 
those who have qualities we lack."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
What do you think you're lacking, Princess Ivy?"
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
Everything. The more I fight alongside my allies, 
the more insufficient I feel."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
Your friends aren't there to outshine you, but to 
support you. I should know─I'm one of them."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I'm often told that I'm too easy to read. I think 
I'd like to learn to be a little more...cunning?"
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Ivy] 
Heh, interesting. If you really wish to learn, you 
could try following my example."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Ivy] 
Your royal title has not compromised your 
honesty, Lady Eirika. I envy that about you."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
What an unexpected compliment. Thank you."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I wish I could make people laugh in the way that 
you do, Jade..."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Jade] 
You do? Why is that?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
Should a battle turn dire, that gift could help to 
hearten our allies. I fear such a day approaches."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Jade] 
You're earnest and kind, Eirika. Your presence 
alone is all the comfort we'll need."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Sometimes people laugh at me...even when I'm 
trying to be serious. Do you know why, Jade?"
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Jade] 
Heh, don't take it too hard. I write for days and 
weeks to get a laugh. You're more efficient."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
E-excuse me, Jade? Are you busy? You look as 
if you're deep in thought..."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Jade] 
Oh. Pardon me, Eirika. I'm not busy. I have no 
pressing tasks, so I was letting my mind wander."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Jean] 
People's hearts are like teacups. Remnants can 
collect over time and pool at the bottom."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
Is that so? What happens if it overflows?"
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Jean] 
It could become a real problem. You should talk 
it out with a professional before that happens."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
Hmm. My heart does feel lighter when we talk, 
so there is a way you can treat me after all."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Jean] 
Emblems are all mind, right? So psychologically, 
you might have the same problems people do."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Hmm. I suppose I am something of a worrier. 
I'll take your advice and keep an eye on that."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Jean] 
Emblems can't get hurt or sick, can they? If you 
never need a doctor, I'm not much use to you."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
You raise a good point. Our relationship does 
seem a bit lopsided..."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Did you enjoy going out with me, Lady Eirika? 
I showed you all of my favorite places."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
Yes, although I'd have liked to spend more time 
with each. You set quite a brisk pace..."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
I am very sorry, but there is too much wonder 
in this world. You must go quickly to see it all."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
You're right. And after that tour, I feel I know 
this place as well as my own home. Thank you."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Your sickness for home─it can be cured only 
by finding joy in this world. Come with me!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
I suppose that makes sense, but─ Hey! Where 
are we going?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
How do you find being on your own in a foreign 
land, Kagetsu? I sometimes get homesick."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Sickness for home? I do not know this feeling. 
For me, it is all adventure and learning."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You're so skilled at crafting with your hands, 
Lapis. I must admit, I envy your ability."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Lapis] 
Thanks, but I had to learn. It's mostly a survival 
skill. I doubt you'd ever have a use for it."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
Oh, but you're wrong! You craft treasures that 
can't be bought, made with love and care."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
Huh. I never thought of it that way... I'd better 
be careful. You're gonna give me a big head!"
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Lapis] 
I just finished crafting something you might like 
to see, Eirika! It's a tiny model furniture set."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Amazing! These look so delicate and precious. 
Thank you, Lapis. I admire your craftiness."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Lapis] 
Have you settled into our world OK, Eirika? 
If you need anything, just say the word."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
Anything? Hmm... I can't hold physical objects, 
but something fun to look at might be nice."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Lindon] 
I believed that I'd see the end of this war, but 
I may have been mistaken."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
Don't abandon hope yet. I believe that an age 
of peace is due."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
That's very well for someone who can't grow 
old to say. The question is, will I live to see it?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
Peace will come sooner than you think. That's 
what I'm here to ensure."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Lindon] 
Haha! Look, Eirika! I made some pop beans 
with Elthunder! Turned out pretty well, huh?"
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Wow, you didn't burn a single bean. I've never 
seen such fine control over one's magic."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You retired from the military once, didn't you? 
Aren't you hesitant to risk your life again?"
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Lindon] 
There's always that risk, but if I can contribute 
somehow, I'm happy to do whatever I can."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Your guess before was surprisingly accurate. 
My friend was a princess and a pegasus knight."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Louis] 
A winning combination to be sure. I'd like to 
hear more about her, if you wouldn't mind."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Louis] 
Discussing her with someone else might help to 
alleviate your loneliness. Tell me every detail!"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
There's some sense in that suggestion, but your 
enthusiasm is a bit...off-putting."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I long for my hometown sometimes. And I miss 
allies from the long war, especially my friend."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Louis] 
What sort of person was this friend? Wait, don't 
tell me. I picture...a beautiful pegasus knight."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Louis] 
Is it true that Emblems cannot touch anyone in 
this world? Does that not get lonely?"
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
It's not so bad. We can perceive kindness, so 
I still feel connected to everyone here."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Alear] 
It's been good to fight at your side, Eirika. 
Is there a way I can thank Ephraim too?"
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
He won't appear in peacetime. If it's the ring or 
his personality, I don't know. But I will tell him."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Alear] 
Thank you. Your support has meant so much to 
me─and that goes for both of you."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
I'm also quite pleased with our experiences thus 
far. I hope we can always work together."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Alear] 
I can feel two presences in your ring, Eirika. 
Is there more than one Emblem in there?"
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
My twin brother Ephraim and I are one Emblem. 
Only at our power's peak can we exist at once."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Of all the rings stolen from Lythos, I'm the last 
to join you. Please excuse my lateness."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Alear] 
It's not your fault. I'm just glad you're back. 
And I promise not to lose you again, Eirika."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Lady Eirika, is there someplace you might wish 
to visit? I will take you anywhere you desire."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
I'm happy for your offer, but where is this 
coming from?"
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
You say you have forgiven me. Yet I still feel the 
need to atone. Does that trouble you?"
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
No. You are a kind soul. Thank you. I'll talk to 
my brother and we'll make a decision."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Who is the warrior who aids you in battle? 
He looks and fights the same as you."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
That's my twin brother. He tells me he's 
impressed by your fighting skill."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Mauvier] 
It is strange to fight beside you. I am sorry for 
what transpired when we retrieved your ring."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
Please don't apologize. I forgave you long ago. 
We're friends now, Mauvier."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I must admit, spending time with you has 
helped me better appreciate the unknown."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
I now see how charming strange creatures can 
be. You've given me a whole new perspective."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
I'm honored, Lady Eirika. It pleases me that 
a princess like you would value my thoughts."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
I hope we can talk more. I want to learn all 
about the entombed and bonewalker monsters!"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Merrin] 
Some animals manage to survive in very harsh 
conditions, you know. I respect them for that."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
I ran into a nest of monsters living in a volcanic 
zone once. I can't say respect was on my mind."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Merrin] 
I absolutely adore unusual critters. Tell me, are 
there any rare creatures in your world?"
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
Do monsters count? We have bonewalkers, 
entombed, revenants...and man-eating spiders."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
The way you live... I've been thinking royals 
should perhaps allow themselves more freedom."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
For sure! If the people ruling a country aren't 
free, how can they build a country that is?"
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
That is a good point. Still, I can't help but think 
a country must be guided by a solid set of rules."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
I get it, I really do. The more I hang with you, 
the more I see that rules can come in handy."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Timerra] 
I love traveling to places incognito, ya know? 
Have you ever done that?"
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Well, I have traveled within my country. Not for 
amusement, sadly...always because of war."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Timerra] 
As a princess, don't you love hanging out with 
castle guards and napping in the royal garden?"
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
I-I would never do something so brash. Where 
I'm from, it would be seen as quite untoward."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
So, about the shouting... I decided to give it a 
try by myself. And I found it quite refreshing!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Pandreo] 
I mean, that's not really the point. You gotta 
shout with other people around, not all alone."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
I see. But, Pandreo, I confess I feel embarrassed 
at the thought of other people hearing me."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
How about you and I give it a test run, then? 
Just the two of us, shouting until it feels right."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Pandreo] 
There's no such thing as party etiquette. I say, 
the louder you shout, the more fun you have!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Shout? I've never done that outside a battle. 
But...yes. I will give it a try!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lady Eirika, how about I give you a lesson in 
living it up? Or...are parties not your thing?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
I do enjoy having fun. Though, how to put this? 
I─ I do not know how to act at parties."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Speaking properly is not what matters. Speaking 
from the heart and with respect─that matters."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Panette] 
Speaking from the heart is...troublesome for me. 
I wonder, can you discern my true feelings?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
Yes, I think so. I can tell that you are pleased we 
have this opportunity to fight beside each other."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Panette] 
Yes, that is correct. I am happy. Oh, it makes 
me blush to find you can read me so easily!"
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Panette, I couldn't help notice your refined way 
of speaking. It is lovely...and also quite adorable."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Panette] 
I studied elocution so as to sound cultured. I've 
not been told I might sound adorable as well."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Panette] 
You speak in such a noble manner, Eirika. 
Refined language is a must for royalty, is it not?"
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
I've never given it much thought. It is simply the 
manner of speaking I am most at ease with."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Rosado] 
Your memories of home must be pretty strong 
to distract you from all my beautiful drawings."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
I'm sorry. I did say they were lovely, and 
I meant it. You're very talented."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
It was because they were so powerful that I was 
reminded of the beautiful scenery back home."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Rosado] 
I'd love to hear about your world sometime. 
It sounds like an interesting place to live."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Rosado] 
Here are some landscapes I drew recently, 
Eirika. Which one's your favorite?"
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Oh, I could never choose─they're all so lovely. 
Looking at them makes me homesick, though..."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You can draw anything you see, can't you? 
What an incredible gift."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Rosado] 
Hehe, not as incredible as your adorable face. 
Actually, let me capture that real quick."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
It's interesting to hear you talk of hunting and 
fishing. I never realized they were so intensive."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Saphir] 
Why not? Those animals and fish are fighting 
to survive. Not much different from war."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
I lived a sheltered life for the most part. I never 
got to have those kinds of experiences."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
Didn't you take on some kinda Demon King? 
That's way more exciting. Tell me about that!"
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You have a powerful physique, Saphir. You must 
train hard to maintain those muscles."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Saphir] 
Hahaha! Sure, but it was really a daily routine of 
hunting and fishing that built this body up."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Saphir] 
Tell me something, Eirika. If Emblems can't 
eat, where do you get the energy to fight?"
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
I have no idea. All I know is that a lack of food 
doesn't hinder me."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Your hair─no, your entire bearing─it is simply 
magnificent. You are a true master of your art."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Seadall] 
That's very kind. I do everything in my power to 
make sure my dance is breathtaking to behold."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
So, it's good to have someone like you around. 
You inspire me to continue working my hardest."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
I'm glad to hear it, Seadall. Seeing you dance 
on the battlefield brings me so much joy."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Seadall] 
Your hair is truly beautiful, Eirika. I wish mine 
shimmered in the light like yours."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Oh, your hair is quite beautiful too. Though with 
it being so long, it must be difficult to tame."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Seadall] 
Your long, flowing hair is perfect for dancing. 
Would you dance with me outside of battle?"
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
Thank you, but I am not skilled at dancing. 
Though, perhaps you would teach me?"
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Alcryst] 
My brother is always supportive of me, but he's 
just being kind. I'm sure he... Secretly, he..."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
Perhaps this is just me, but if he truly felt 
otherwise, would he really be so considerate?"
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
Everyone still has something to learn and room 
to grow. Our brothers see our true potential."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
I suppose you're right. I worry that I won't live 
up to that potential...but I'll try my best like you."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Alcryst] 
You have an amazing older brother like me, so 
you must know how sibling inferiority feels..."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
I do, but Ephraim speaks honest praise for me 
often. I know your brother must do the same."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Alcryst] 
I'm sorry you got stuck with me, Lady Eirika. 
My brother is far superior. Compared to him, I..."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
I feel the same way about my own brother. 
I often fret that he should be here in my stead..."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Amber] 
Your retainer was called the Silver Knight...and 
I'm just an alpaca-wrangling master..."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
Is something the matter, Amber? You look as if 
you're in pain..."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Amber] 
I'm a royal retainer, but I don't have a cool title! 
What can I do to earn a knightly nickname?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
There's just one thing you should do: your best. 
Legends and nicknames will follow. I promise!"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Amber] 
I've come a long way─from alpaca ranch hand 
to royal retainer. Do you have retainers, Eirika?"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
I did, once. He was a brave, benevolent knight 
named Seth. Many called him the Silver Knight."
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
My world didn't have any of those ""alpacas"" you 
love, Amber. They're so unusual and adorable!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Amber] 
Adorable? Yes! Unusual? I don't know about 
that one. They're a perfect pet for any home!"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I want to protect others, the same as you."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
I may well lack your noble heritage, but I share 
your convictions."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Vander] 
That a princess and an old knight might each 
risk all in service of that belief... It is surprising."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
Not at all. We are the same in that we both try 
to protect those who can't protect themselves."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
When you fight, Vander, what drives you? 
Why do you risk your life in combat?"
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Vander] 
That is quite simple─to protect those I love. 
My life is entirely in service to that idea."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I was told you were skilled at knitting, yet I'd 
not seen you practice the art. How wonderful!"
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Vander] 
It's rare I'm praised so genuinely. People are 
often more surprised than anything."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I'm sorry if I sounded discouraging before. 
I did not mean to deter you from fighting."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
Oh, but I'm glad you told me how you felt. 
It's helpful to hear other opinions."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
More than that, I think you spoke out of 
kindness. And I love your kind heart."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
Thank you for trying to comfort me. Know that 
I will always support you with all of my power."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
Do you ever get tired of fighting, Veyle? 
I...sometimes wonder if anyone ever truly wins."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Veyle] 
I used to feel that way. But I've put my trust 
in someone, and I will follow where they lead."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Veyle] 
As an Emblem visiting this world, what do you 
think of Divine Dragons and Fell Dragons?"
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
I understand that one is thought to be holy and 
the other evil. But perhaps there is more to it?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Yunaka] 
You're such a genuine and charismatic person, 
Eirika. Must be how you were raised."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Eirika] 
I'm flattered, but I'm sure I could say the same 
about you."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
Nah, not really, even if it's nice to hear you say 
so. Not many people are as honest as you."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Eirika] 
I understand. And people like you are an equally 
rare find, Yunaka."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
You seem to have boundless energy, Yunaka. 
I can't help but enjoy myself around you."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Zappy! But if I get my energy from having fun 
with you, how do we know who started it?!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 

[Eirika] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Well, look at you! Sleek as a sword, sharp as a 
razor─those cheekbones could cut glass!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Eirika] 
I'll take that as a compliment? Thank you."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I've decided on a pursuit, Zelkov. I want to bring 
peace to the people of this world."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 
That seems less of a *pursuit* to me and more 
of a responsibility."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Eirika] 
I'm not doing it because I have to. I'm doing it 
because I want to see people living happily."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Zelkov] 
I fail to see the distinction, but it is a *worthy* 
answer nevertheless."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Anyone can take up a pursuit. You need only 
*select* something and begin."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Eirika] 
Good idea. I'll give that some thought."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 

[Eirika] 2 

[Eirika] 
I'm impressed by your broad range of interests. 
I don't have any hobbies at all."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
My pursuits *provide* me with a sense of 
purpose. They are my greatest source of joy."
