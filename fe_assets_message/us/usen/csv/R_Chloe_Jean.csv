[Jean] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Chloé] 
Jean? You seem pale."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Jean] 
I've just been thinking..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Chloé] 
About what?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Jean] 
I'm scared of losing people, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jean] 
Every day on the battlefield, people get hurt. 
Some even die."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Jean] 
I've seen things that I could never have 
imagined back in my peaceful hometown."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Jean] 
Doesn't any of this scare you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Chloé] 
Of course it does. And I'm sure we're not the 
only ones."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Chloé] 
But there are things we have to do, even if it 
means facing our fears to do them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Chloé] 
That's the thought that drives us all to fight, 
day after day. It's what drives me, at least."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Jean] 
Things we have to do, even if it's scary, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Chloé] 
I'm sure you have some too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Chloé] 
I've seen you stand out on the battlefield 
without running from injury or death."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Jean] 
I suppose so. Thank you, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Jean] 
It probably won't ever get less scary, but that 
doesn't mean I'll run."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Jean] 
Not when I've got a steadfast friend like you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Chloé] 
""Steadfast""! I like the sound of that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jean] 
Besides, you have an iron stomach, right? 
People like that are hard to kill."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Jean] 
Although...if your stomach does hurt after 
eating something strange, see me straightaway."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Chloé] 
Haha! I'm touched by your concern."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Jean] 
I mean it, OK? Seriously!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Chloé] 
I won't go dying on you, Jean. Not so long as 
you're watching out for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Jean] 2 
[Chloé] 
Hey, Jean. Would these herbs be useful?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Jean] 
Definitely! You have a good eye for this, Chloé. 
I can use those to relieve fevers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Chloé] 
Oh! That's good, 'cause I see a lot more 
growing just over there!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Jean] 
Thanks for your help. Go ahead and pick a few 
more than usual."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Jean] 
It's been really nice having you out here 
with me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Chloé] 
Well, your medicine has been a big help for 
all of us, so I'm happy to return the favor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Jean] 
Still, it's very kind of you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Jean] 
Just be careful, OK? This part of the forest can 
get pretty dark in places."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Chloé] 
Huh, you're right. This is just the kind of forest 
that feels like it could be...haAaAuUunted."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Jean] 
Haunted?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Chloé] 
Hahaha, are you scared of ghosts, Jean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Jean] 
No. The idea of ghosts doesn't frighten me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Chloé] 
Most children would say that just to sound 
brave, but...you mean it, don't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jean] 
A ghost can't really do anything to you. No, 
what's much scarier to me is illness and injury."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Jean] 
Things that could actually end someone's life."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Chloé] 
Mmm... Good point."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Chloé] 
In that case, we should gather more herbs so 
we can be better prepared for those things."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Jean] 
Right. Many illnesses and injuries are highly 
treatable, if you know what to do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Jean] 
You don't mind staying out with me a little 
longer, do you, Chloé?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Chloé] 
Of course not!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Jean] 2 
[Jean] 
Um...excuse me, Chloé?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Chloé] 
Well, hello, Jean. Did you need help 
with something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Jean] 
Not exactly. In fact, I thought maybe I could 
help you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Chloé] 
With what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Jean] 
I'd like you to have this stomach medicine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Chloé] 
Oh my! Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Chloé] 
But my stomach's not upset. Why did you think 
I needed medicine for it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jean] 
Well, you eat so much weird stuff. It's only 
a matter of time before it disagrees with you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Chloé] 
Haha! Are you worried all the folk food I eat 
won't sit well with me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Chloé] 
Don't you worry about that. I've got an 
iron stomach."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jean] 
Still and all, it's good to be prepared."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Jean] 
Just the other day, I saw you stuffing yourself 
with what looked like...weird eyeballs."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Jean] 
Whatever that was, there's no way it can be 
healthy for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Chloé] 
Maybe, but they're so good! I'll save some for 
you next time, as thanks for the medicine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Jean] 
What?! Um, that's OK. Your thanks are enough."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Jean] 
Anyway, be careful. It scares me to think of 
what you're putting in your body."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Chloé] 
Sure, I'll be careful. Thanks for looking out for 
me, Jean!"
