MID_RELIANCE_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Princess Hortensia!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Hey, before you run away, you should know 
I've decided to stop trying to help you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
I don't think anything I do is gonna suddenly 
make you confident."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alcryst] 
That feels like the right decision. I know it was 
me who came to you for help at first."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Yeah, and that was pretty rude."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alcryst] 
I understand. Once again, I apologize."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alcryst] 
To make things right, you're free to ignore me 
from this point forward."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Nope. I refuse."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alcryst] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Look. You're a quivering pile of pessimism, 
and maybe that's not gonna change."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Hortensia] 
Either way, I accept you exactly as you are."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alcryst] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Hortensia] 
I think I understand why you came to me 
for help in the first place."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Hortensia] 
It was because you thought confidence would 
bring you closer to people, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Well...yes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alcryst] 
I thought that gaining confidence might lead to 
more meaningful friendships with everyone."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Hortensia] 
Lovely sentiment, but you don't need to 
reinvent yourself for it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Sure, you're kind of a downer. So what? 
You've got plenty of great qualities too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Hortensia] 
That's why we're friends. You don't need to 
change a thing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alcryst] 
Really? Thank you, Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Hortensia] 
Eh, just being honest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alcryst] 
You are honest but also kind. I still feel the light 
from your radiant heart, and yet..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alcryst] 
This time, I can remain by your side... Perhaps 
it's because I understand you better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Hortensia] 
Hey, how about that? You're looking me 
in the eye!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alcryst] 
I am. I want to make up for how I acted before. 
I feel ashamed to have run from you like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Hortensia] 
Now you're, uh...getting pretty close to me..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Hortensia] 
Hey, you're a prince. It's improper for you to... 
look at me like..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Hortensia] 
Aaah! That's supposed to be my thiiing!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Hortensia] 

[Alcryst] 
Princess Hortensia?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Alcryst] 
Haha, now I know how it feels to talk to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Hey! I know you can hear me!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Ah...Princess Hortensia!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alcryst] 
Please, speaking to me will only dampen 
your mood."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Always a bundle of joy, you are. But that's 
exactly what I wanna talk to you about."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Hortensia] 
Listen. I'm gonna help you get some confidence, 
just like you asked."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alcryst] 
What? Really?! Oh, thank you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alcryst] 
Why did you change your mind? You seemed 
so strongly opposed to it earlier."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Hortensia] 
That was a joke. I got carried away. Sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Hortensia] 
I may not love Brodia, but you're my friend."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Hortensia] 
And when a friend's in trouble, you help. 
Simple as that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alcryst] 
Princess Hortensia, I... I..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Hortensia] 
Hey! What's with all the tears?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Actually, you're kinda cute when you get all 
emotional. Anyway, let's get started, shall we?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alcryst] 
N-no, don't come any closer. Please, don't look 
at me like this..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Hortensia] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Hortensia] 
What's the problem this time?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Are you really gonna turn down my help after 
all that?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alcryst] 
You called me a friend. You agreed to help me..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alcryst] 
Princess Hortensia... You are, without a shadow 
of a doubt, a wonderful person."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alcryst] 
But the more wonderful you are, the deeper I 
tumble into despair..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Hortensia] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alcryst] 
Your kind heart shines too bright! It reveals my 
heart for the worm-ridden filth that it is!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Alcryst] 
So please, don't come near me! Spare me! 
I am so, so sorry!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Alcryst] 
[Hortensia] 
That boy has self-deprecation down to 
an art form."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Excuse me, Princess Hortensia?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Hortensia] 
Prince Alcryst? What's up? You're not usually 
much of a talker."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Well, I was just, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alcryst] 
No, never mind. It's not important."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Hortensia] 
Nope! No running off after a buildup like that!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Come on, spit it out!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Hortensia] 
Nope─didn't hear you. Louder."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alcryst] 
I, uh... I..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alcryst] 
Please teach me how to be more confident!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Ow! Too loud!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Hortensia] 
Tone it down, back it up, and explain 
yourself properly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alcryst] 
You always have such boundless confidence, 
Princess Hortensia. It amazes me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alcryst] 
I don't think very highly of myself...so I hoped 
you might teach me to be more like you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Aaah, OK. Yeah, makes sense."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Too bad for you though! I'm not teaching 
you a thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Hortensia] 
Maybe if you weren't a prince of Brodia, I'd 
have considered it. But you? Nope. No way."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alcryst] 
Of course. I understand..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Wait, what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Brodia has invaded Elusia more times than I 
can count. You have every right to deny me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Alcryst] 
Besides, you shouldn't waste your precious 
time on someone as worthless as me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Alcryst] 
Honestly, I'm shocked by my own impertinence. 
How embarrassing... I'll leave you be."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Alcryst] 
[Hortensia] 
Hang on a sec! I never said that!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Alcryst] 
It's all right. Please, forget I even approached 
you like this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025,"[Alcryst] 
I won't sully your ears with my pitiful mumbles 
ever again. You have my word."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026,"[Alcryst] 
[Hortensia] 
Wait! Prince Alcryst!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#027,"[Hortensia] 
Hm, I was so sure he'd get mad and snap back. 
He's even worse off than I thought."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#028,"[Hortensia] 
I'll have to try a new approach the next time 
I see him."
