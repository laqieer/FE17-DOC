[Rosado] 
Well, Goldmary? How's the omelet?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Goldmary] 
Excellent. You got the texture just right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
I knew you could do it. That's why I didn't want 
you to quit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Rosado] 
I stuck with it because of what you said."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Rosado] 
I'm one of the most charming people you've 
ever met, but I'll be a loser if I quit too easily."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Goldmary] 
Well remembered."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Rosado] 
They were familiar words."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Rosado] 
Hortensia said basically the same thing to me 
back at the academy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Goldmary] 
I know. She told me about how you first 
behaved when you started there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Goldmary] 
You were so focused on being popular that you 
completely neglected your studies."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Rosado] 
Yeah. She said no matter how cute or charming 
I am, I'll be a loser if I don't apply myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Rosado] 
It's not enough just to be cute. I have to work 
to improve too. You reminded me of that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Goldmary] 
I'm so glad. It wouldn't have looked good 
for me to be friends with a quitter."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Goldmary] 
Then again, if you really were a loser, we would 
never have become friends in the first place."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Goldmary] 
I'm still not sure I understand why exactly 
you wanted to learn to cook, though."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Rosado] 
I'm trying to be...your equal, Goldmary."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Rosado] 
You always have my back in battle. I want you 
to feel like you can trust me too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Rosado] 
So I guess you could say I'm trying to...grow. 
As a person."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Goldmary] 
That's very sweet, but I have to ask..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Goldmary] 
How is your being a good cook supposed to 
help me trust on you on the battlefield?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Rosado] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Goldmary] 
It's all right. Even if all your hard work means 
nothing, I'm still proud of you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Rosado] 
Ugh... OK, OK, you made your point."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Goldmary] 
Haha, don't worry! I trust you with my life, 
whether on the battlefield or in the kitchen."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Rosado] 
Good. I won't let you down."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 

[Rosado] 
Dang it, Goldmary! Why are my omelets not as 
good as yours?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Rosado] 
I followed all the steps you showed me. 
What am I missing?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Goldmary] 
There's a trick to it. You'll pick it up 
with practice."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Rosado] 
Why is cooking so much harder than eating? 
Maybe I'm not cut out for this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Goldmary] 
Giving up already? You've only just started."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Rosado] 
It's not that I want to give up. I just don't want 
the stress of being bad at something."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Goldmary] 
You know, Rosado..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Goldmary] 
You have so many wonderful qualities."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Rosado] 
Aw, thanks! Wait, why are you complimenting 
me all of a sudden?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Goldmary] 
In fact, you're one of the most charming 
people I've ever met."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Goldmary] 
Giving up just because you weren't perfect 
right away, though..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Goldmary] 
That's the only thing that could ever make you 
look like a loser."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Rosado] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Goldmary] 
Ah, well. I guess it can't be helped."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Goldmary] 
You've already decided you don't want 
the stress."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Goldmary] 
Consider our cooking lessons canceled."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Rosado] 
Wait."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Rosado] 
No. I wanna keep going."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Goldmary] 
Ah, you do?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Rosado] 
Yes! Let me take dinner shift tonight. I'll make 
omelets for everybody!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Goldmary] 
That should give you all the practice you need."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 

[Rosado] 
Hey, Goldmary! Could you teach me how 
to cook?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I could, but why the sudden interest?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Rosado] 
I've been thinking..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Rosado] 
When it comes to cuteness, I'm obviously 
miles ahead of you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Goldmary] 
Excuse me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Rosado] 
But you're still better than me at a lot of things. 
And cooking is one of your many talents."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Rosado] 
So I figure, if I really want to compete with 
you, I should learn. How hard could it be?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Goldmary] 
Sorry, but I'm still not past the part where you 
said you're miles ahead of me in cuteness."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Rosado] 
Really? Well, we can come back to that 
another day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Rosado] 
The important thing is I want to learn to cook, 
and I want you to teach me. What do you say?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Goldmary] 
Not the most flattering way to ask for a favor."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Goldmary] 
But since we're friends... All right. I'll teach you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Rosado] 
Yes! Thanks, Goldmary!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Rosado] 
Soon I'll be adorable and multitalented!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Goldmary] 
I suppose we'll see..."
