[Lapis] 
Lady Anna, did you find a buyer for that 
snowman doll?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Anna] 
Oh, right... The thing about that is..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
What's...what's wrong? Are you crying?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Anna] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Lapis] 
You weren't able to sell it, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Anna] 
Nope. I'm real, real sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Anna] 
I was carrying it around, trying to find a buyer, 
when I dropped it. There's...not much left."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Lapis] 
Oh, I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Anna] 
Pathetic, huh? Here I was, talking myself up..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Anna] 
I'll give you the billion gold I promised to make 
up for it. I hope you can forgive me..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lapis] 
That's all right, Lady Anna. I don't need money."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Anna] 
You don't...need money? What?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Lapis] 
Nope. I don't want compensation. I just want 
another chance to make something for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Anna] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Lapis] 
I had a good time crafting that doll! I'd hate for 
it to be the only time we work together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lapis] 
Plus...I've been hearing about Wintertide Village 
since I was a little girl."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Lapis] 
A secluded village in Elusia with festivals 
year-round. I always dreamed of going there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Anna] 
Word traveled that far, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Lapis] 
Yes! To be honest, I thought it was the stuff of 
bedtime stories. But it's real! Who knew!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Lapis] 
I felt so blessed to be making something that 
celebrates such a wondrous place..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lapis] 
So what do you say? Let's give it one more try. 
Or however many tries it takes to get it right!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Anna] 
I like that attitude."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Anna] 
Let's give ourselves a do-over! This time, we'll 
do it right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lapis] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Anna] 
I mean we should budget for some real 
materials instead of cast-off junk."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Lapis] 
Um... That's a bit intimidating. I don't usually 
use proper materials."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Anna] 
How much harder could it be?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Lapis] 
Well, I'll just have to do my best to make 
something that flies off the shelves!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Anna] 
Attagirl!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Anna] 
Once we get our operation going again, boom! 
We'll make a killing and retire young!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1

[Lapis] 
Lady Anna? I've made an item that perfectly 
captures the spirit of your village."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Anna] 
What, for real?! That was quick!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lapis] 
Yes. I took some bits and bobs I found lying 
around and made them into a snowman doll."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Anna] 
Wow! It's so cute!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lapis] 
That's not all. See that bell the snowman is 
holding? Give it a twist."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Anna] 
Like this?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Anna] 
Hey! It even plays music! How'd you get it to 
do that?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lapis] 
Someone threw out a music box, so I 
incorporated it into the design."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lapis] 
Oh, and if you look at the doll from different 
angles, it sparkles."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Lapis] 
I stuck shiny little pebbles onto it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Anna] 
That's genius! Oh, I knew I had an eye 
for talent!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Anna] 
And since you just used cast-off materials, 
our production costs are practically nothing!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Anna] 
This is the BEST! It combines my two favorite 
things─cute and free!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Lapis] 
I'm glad you like it! Thanks for giving me a 
chance to flex my creative muscles."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Anna] 
Trust me, I'm the one who should be thanking 
you here."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Anna] 
Just wait until you get your share of the profits. 
We're gonna make a killing!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1

[Anna] 
Hey, you're Lapis, right? I've been looking all 
over for you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Anna] 
I hear you're a whiz at making neat stuff out 
of whatever's lying around."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Lapis] 
Um, yes. That's me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Anna] 
Yes! I smell profit to be made."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Anna] 
The name's Lady Anna. I'm a merchant who's 
just as good at cutting wood as cutting costs!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lapis] 
Oh. Uh, all right. It's a pleasure to meet 
you, Anna."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Anna] 
Aw, you don't have to be so formal! Lady Anna 
is fine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Anna] 
Bottom line, Lapis, we should be in 
business together."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lapis] 
Heh. I'm...not sure I follow."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Anna] 
There's nothing to it! You'll be in charge of 
supplying cute goods, and I'll drum up demand."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Anna] 
Boom! We make a killing. I'm happy, you're 
happy, the customer's happy. Win-win-win."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Anna] 
As labor, you'll get your share, of course. Come 
on, pleeease? Don't make a little girl cry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Lapis] 
Let's slow down a bit here. What sort of things 
would you want me to make?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Anna] 
Well, I'm from Wintertide Village, so something 
related to that would be nice!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Lapis] 
I see. So you'd want something that reminds 
people of your hometown."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Anna] 
You're the ideas department. Once you have a 
product, I'll work my sales and marketing magic."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Lapis] 
Uh, sure... OK."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Anna] 
What, you don't believe me? You think I can't 
close a sale just 'cause I'm a little kid?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Anna] 
I'll give you a guarantee─if I can't sell whatever 
you make, I'll give you one billion gold!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Anna] 
It's a can't-lose proposition!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Lapis] 
All right. I'll try to think of something to make..."
