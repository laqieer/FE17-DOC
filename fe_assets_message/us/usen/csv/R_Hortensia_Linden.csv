[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Hortensia] 
What can I do for Elusia?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
What can I do, Father? Help me..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
If he were here, I'm sure King Hyacinth would 
say that you already serve our kingdom well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Hortensia] 
Lindon..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Hortensia] 
How can you be so sure? My father's...gone."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Hortensia] 
Ivy was always the model daughter, but I... 
I was more of a pain."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Hortensia] 
When I imagine him looking down on me, all 
I see on his face is disappointment."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lindon] 
I was originally a retainer to the king's older 
brother─your uncle. I think you knew that..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Lindon] 
At that time...I did not think kindly of 
King Hyacinth."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Really? I had no idea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Lindon] 
There was a scrabble for succession, with your 
uncle openly opposing your father's claim."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Lindon] 
In the end, the elder brother lost the battle for 
the throne...and soon abandoned the country."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lindon] 
I had argued passionately in favor of your uncle, 
so I resented your father right out of the gates."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Lindon] 
But then, one day, he turned to me and said, 
""Lindon, you serve our kingdom well."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Ah..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Lindon] 
I didn't know what to make of that. He and I 
were supposed to be enemies!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lindon] 
Then I realized that he meant it. In uncertain 
times, we both cared deeply for Elusia's safety."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Lindon] 
That's why I can confidently speak for him and 
say...you serve our kingdom well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Hortensia] 
That means a lot to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lindon] 
What's more, a parent always loves their child."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Lindon] 
King Hyacinth could never be disappointed in 
you, Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Lindon] 
I've raised three children to your nil, so if I say 
it's true...you have no room to argue."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Hortensia] 
OK, OK. Consider me convinced."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Hortensia] 
I really do feel much better now. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Hortensia] 
I'm going to keep taking care of myself─and 
keep doing my best. I'll make Father proud."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Lindon] 
That's it. That's the spirit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Lindon] 
I may lack time, but I'm never short on words of 
advice. If you ever need to talk, I will listen."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Lindon] 
You're a fine, accomplished young woman. 
I'm eager to see what else you become."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Hortensia] 
I'll make you proud too, Lindon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Lindon] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Lindon, can we talk?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Hortensia] 
I was hoping you might...reconsider giving me 
some lessons."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lindon] 
As I said before, Princess Hortensia, I don't 
have the energy for teaching anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lindon] 
Besides, I've heard that you're already top of 
the class in the Elusian Academy, are you not?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lindon] 
There's no reason to rush your education. 
Take the time to grow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Hortensia] 
My father didn't live long enough to see me 
make it on my own."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Hortensia] 
That's why I'm in a rush. I don't want any 
more regrets like that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lindon] 
Ah, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Hortensia] 
I want my father to rest knowing I can take care 
of myself─like your children do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Hortensia] 
You can help me with that, can't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lindon] 
I understand you, truly. But...I have further 
reasons to decline."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Hortensia] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Lindon] 
Since King Hyacinth's abrupt passing, Elusia 
has been gripped in a moment of crisis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lindon] 
In a time such as this, even a minor incident 
could upset the balance of our kingdom."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lindon] 
To protect my beloved Elusia, I must dedicate 
all of my strength to our reconstruction efforts."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Lindon] 
Under these conditions, I simply do not have 
any time to devote to you, Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Hortensia] 
So that's why Ivy was asking for you..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Hortensia] 
I'm sorry, Lindon. I was being selfish."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Hortensia] 
I was thinking only of my own education, while 
you and Ivy are both hard at work for Elusia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Lindon] 
No, no. You have nothing to apologize for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Lindon] 
There's no fault in looking out for yourself, 
Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Hortensia] 
Maybe you're right. Thanks."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Hortensia] 
I am still a princess of Elusia, though. Let me 
know if there's anything I can do to help."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Lindon] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Hey, Lindon! My sister's asking for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Lindon] 
Ah, thank you, Princess Hortensia. So sorry to 
have made you fetch me like this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Hortensia] 
That's OK─I had a thing to do and you were on 
the way. Oh, that's a pretty painting!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Hortensia] 
The lady's beautiful... Is she your daughter?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lindon] 
This lovely painting is of my even lovelier wife."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Yeah, she's a vision. You're a lucky guy!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lindon] 
If she were here now, I'm sure she would be 
delighted to hear you say so."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Hortensia] 
You'll have to introduce us next time she's 
around. I'd love to meet her."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lindon] 
Unfortunately, that will not be possible... 
She passed away some time ago."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Hortensia] 
Oh... Oh no. I had no idea. I'm so sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Lindon] 
Hm-hm, it's quite all right, Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lindon] 
We raised three children together. They're all 
grown now, off living lives of their own."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Lindon] 
I've had mages to train and keep me company, 
and I'm sure she's at peace in the hereafter."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Hortensia] 
You've accomplished so much. I'm sure if she 
were here, she'd say she's very proud."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Say, Lindon... Would you consider giving me 
some lessons? I could learn a lot from you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lindon] 
I'm flattered that you would suggest the idea... 
but I think it best for us both that I decline."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Hortensia] 
How come?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Lindon] 
I simply don't have the stamina to 
teach anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Hortensia] 
I understand. You've still got battles to fight. 
I shouldn't trouble you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Lindon] 
Don't fret! I'm sure there's a spry spellcaster 
out there who would make the perfect tutor."
