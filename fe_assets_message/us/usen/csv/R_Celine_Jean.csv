[Jean] 
Ugh... It's just not sinking in."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Céline] 1 

[Céline] 
Hello, Jean. You appear to be hard at work 
with your studies."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Jean] 
Princess Céline!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Jean] 
I've read this chapter over and over, and I'm 
just not getting it. My brain is too tired."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Céline] 
I know what you need. Here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Jean] 
Is that smell...my hometown tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Céline] 
It is indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Céline] 
I saw you struggling with your studies and 
judged that you were in need of a break."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Jean] 
Wow. Thanks, Princess Céline!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Jean] 
Mmm, this smell... It's so relaxing. It reminds me 
a lot of home."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Céline] 
Now, Jean. You mentioned once that you didn't 
believe tea could save lives."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Céline] 
But I say to you that your hometown tea has 
saved me too many times to count."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Jean] 
Tea...saved you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Céline] 
When things aren't going well and I'm in low 
spirits...that's a sign that it's teatime."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Céline] 
A hot cup of tea in these situations does much 
to lift my mood."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Céline] 
Things tend to go better afterward, even if it's 
only because I've cleared my head."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Céline] 
When the problems I'm dealing with are severe, 
is it an exaggeration to say that tea saves me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Jean] 
No. I suppose it isn't."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Jean] 
In fact, my own spirits feel pretty lifted now!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Jean] 
Thank you, Princess Céline. I learned something 
valuable today, and it wasn't from this book."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Jean] 
I guess, medically speaking, I can't count out 
the healing power of tea. Sorry about that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Céline] 
You have nothing to apologize for. I'm relieved 
to hear your mood has improved."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Jean] 
When I get home and see my mother, I'm going 
to tell her that our tea is the best in the world."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Céline] 
If she doubts you, I shall visit in person to 
inform her that her tea always brings me joy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Jean] 
Actually, if it's OK with Your Highness, could 
we have our teatime now?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Jean] 
Drinking tea alone's no fun, and besides... 
I want to talk to Your Highness a little more."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Jean] 
I'll get right back to studying when we're done, 
of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Céline] 
Hahaha, nothing would make me happier."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Céline] 
To be honest, I was in the mood for some tea 
as well. I apologize for speaking out of turn."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Céline] 
Well then, shall we retire to the tea room? 
There's so much more about tea to discuss!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Jean] 
Lead the way!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Jean] 2 

[Céline] 
Hello, Jean."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Jean] 
Hello, Princess Céline!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Céline] 
Oh, is that a medical text? I'm not interrupting 
your studies, I hope."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Jean] 
Don't worry about it. I'm just reading up so 
I can be a good doctor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Céline] 
How exemplary. Perhaps another day, then."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Jean] 
Hmm? Oh, you mean for that teatime?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Céline] 
Yes. A batch of tea from your home arrived, 
so I wondered if today would suit you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Céline] 
But your studies are more important."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Jean] 
I'm very sorry. But thanks for thinking of me!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Céline] 
Teatime is postponed, not canceled, dear. 
Our anticipation shall make it all the sweeter."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Jean] 
My hometown's tea must really be amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Céline] 
Haha, you're just realizing this now?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Céline] 
The tea grown in your hometown is nonpareil, 
I assure you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Jean] 
Gosh!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Céline] 
Have you never considered a future in tea? 
Taking up your mother's trade, so to speak."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Jean] 
Not really. I like tea, but it can't save lives."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Céline] 
It can't...save lives?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Jean] 
Hm? Princess Céline?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Céline] 
I'm sorry, it's nothing. You have studying to do. 
I shall take my leave and my leaves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Jean] 
Well, thank you. I was just at a really fascinating 
part of this text!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Céline] 
Be diligent, but don't push yourself beyond 
your limits."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Jean] 2 

[Céline] 
I must thank you, Jean."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Jean] 
Princess Céline? What are you thanking me for?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Céline] 
The tea produced in your hometown is far and 
away my favorite."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Céline] 
There is joy in each and every sip. So I thought 
it appropriate to thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Jean] 
Ah. In that case, I should thank you too."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Jean] 
My mother will be over the moon to find out 
you like it so much."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Céline] 
Your mother?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Jean] 
She works at a tea shop back home."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Jean] 
You've probably had tea brewed from leaves 
that my mother processed."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Céline] 
I see! Do pass on my thanks, then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Jean] 
I will. Praise from Your Highness would be 
the pride of a lifetime for my mother."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Céline] 
Would you like to join me for tea sometime?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Céline] 
We can brew some tea leaves from your home 
and drink to your mother's health."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Jean] 
Oh! I've done nothing to deserve such an 
invitation, but I'm grateful anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Jean] 
I'll be looking forward to it!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Céline] 
As shall I. You'll be hearing from me."
