[Goldmary] 
Divine One, I must apologize for what happened 
last time we spoke."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I was so overcome with joy, I actually made you 
stay with me until I was finished crying."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
That's all right. I'm just glad to see you 
feeling better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Goldmary] 
After it was over, I realized it would make more 
sense if you knew about my childhood."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
Oh, what about it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Goldmary] 
Everyone always fawned over me when I was 
young. So much so, in fact, it was all I knew."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Goldmary] 
But in Elusia, when you reach a certain age, 
you have to leave home for the academy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Goldmary] 
For the first time, I had competitors. Others 
were more popular than me. I was devastated."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Goldmary] 
I came to understand that some people can 
simply be better. I began to question everything."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
That must have been difficult."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Goldmary] 
Since then, I've become a bit of a perfectionist. 
Being anything less than ideal is frustrating."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Goldmary] 
But then you said you thought I was charming."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
And I stand by that. Somehow you always 
manage to be charming─even on the battlefield."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Goldmary] 
Thank you. As soon as you said those words, 
I felt my confidence come flooding back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Goldmary] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
Is this...good crying?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Goldmary] 
Can't you tell by how these tears...glisten on my 
cheeks like the morning dew?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, Divine One... I have such powerful 
feelings, it would be a crime to contain myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Goldmary] 
You'll just have to admire this magnificence... 
to your heart's content..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
I'll remain by your side until you're finished."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
Goldmary! Are you OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Oh, Divine One... Did the sound of my soul in 
anguish finally get your attention? I'm so glad..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
What's wrong? Talk to me─I'm here to help."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Goldmary] 
It's just that...I can't possibly be any 
more charming."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
Ah, what?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Goldmary] 
Everyone always says I'm the most popular 
woman in the world..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Goldmary] 
But if you're immune to my charms, I know that 
can't be true. My confidence is shattered..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Goldmary] 
So here I stand... My tears flowing freely, like 
two rivers of glittering diamonds..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
Uh, look..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings somehow. 
I really didn't mean to."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Goldmary] 
No, please don't apologize. Only tell me what 
I can do to earn your affection."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
You don't need to do anything special. 
I already think you're quite charming."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Goldmary] 
You do? You think I'm charming?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
Of course. And it's not just me, you know. 
Everyone loves you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
So don't feel like you have to push yourself 
so hard over this, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Goldmary] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Goldmary] 
WAAAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
What's wrong?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Goldmary] 
Nothing, nothing... I'm just so relieved."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Goldmary] 
Thank you... As a token of my appreciation, you 
may admire my perfect tears a while longer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alear] 
Um, OK. Thanks..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Goldmary] 
Was the meal to your satisfaction, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Oh yes, it was delicious. Thanks so much."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Could you look me in the eyes, please?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
Uh, sure?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Goldmary] 
Perfect. Keep on looking right at me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Goldmary] 
You have such an intense gaze... Tell me what 
you're feeling in this moment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
Hmm... Nothing much, really..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Goldmary] 
Have I stirred your heart so little?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Goldmary] 
Let me ask you again. I'll whisper in your ear 
this time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Goldmary] 
Has your lunch with me today brought you any 
feelings of contentment?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
Oh, very much so."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Goldmary] 
I knew it. I'm so glad. Tell me more about 
these feelings."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
Well... I'm so content I couldn't eat another 
bite. I'd be really curious to learn your recipe."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Goldmary] 
My...recipe."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Goldmary] 
Not exactly what I had in mind... But if that's 
really what you want, I'll teach you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Thanks for meeting with me, Divine One. 
I took the liberty of setting a table for you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
This is incredible. You made all this for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Goldmary] 
I did. The presentation is rather plain by my 
usual standards, I have to admit."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Goldmary] 
You might wonder why I'd go so far out of my 
way to prepare such an unremarkable dish."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Goldmary] 
But this one has a special place in my heart."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Goldmary] 
So in that sense, making it for you is an 
expression of my truest self."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
Thank you. That means a lot to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Goldmary] 
I'm so glad."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Goldmary] 
Divine One, if I may..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Goldmary] 
There is something I'd like to say to you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Goldmary] 
Before, I might have hidden this by insisting 
you must have feelings for me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Goldmary] 
But that's beneath me now. Thanks to you, 
I'm confident enough to say how I feel."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Goldmary] 
I'm falling in love with you, . 
More and more each day."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
You are?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Goldmary] 
Please tell me you feel the same."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Goldmary] 
Please tell me you think I'd make a perfect 
partner for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
Perfect?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
Hehe, ever the perfectionist, even now. I have 
to say, it's endearing."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
Forgive me if I'm a little speechless, Goldmary. 
Your confession took me by surprise."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
But I couldn't imagine a more perfect partner 
than you. So I want you to have this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Goldmary] 
The Pact Ring... I feel like I'm dreaming."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
You're not. Try it on."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Goldmary] 
Ah, look! A perfect fit! And just the right match 
for these elegant hands."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
I couldn't agree more."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Goldmary] 
Sweet of you to say. Now, shall we sit down 
and eat? Wouldn't want it to get cold."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
Great idea. Let's."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Goldmary] 
I feel like I owe the people of the world an 
apology. No one else gets to be this happy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Goldmary] 
Actually, let's toast to that. Glasses up."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Goldmary] 
Here's to us─the envy of the world. I want to 
be with you for the rest of my life."
