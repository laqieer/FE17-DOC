[Etie] 
How did you like our run the other day?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
That was my first time ever doing 100 laps 
around anything. I slept like a baby afterward."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
And then came the muscle aches the 
next morning."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Etie] 
Oops. I should've warned you about that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
But the run itself was just like you said!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
When I ran, I could feel my troubles fade away. 
There was nothing on my mind but the run."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
It was honestly pretty strange."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Etie] 
So you get it now! Oh, it's such an honor to 
be able to do that for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Etie] 
But we're not done yet. Next time, I'd like you 
to try some muscle balm afterward."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
Some what now?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Etie] 
You have to let yourself recover after serious 
exercise or your muscles will complain again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
Ahh. That makes sense."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
If I keep jogging with the muscle balm you 
mentioned, will I be as confident as you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Etie] 
Of course. It works for me, and I'm just a 
normal person."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Etie] 
The Divine One on this program? You'd be so 
confident that you might actually start glowing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
Hehe, the way you say it, I almost believe it 
could happen."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
I was content before to be inspired by your 
confidence, but with these exercises..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
Maybe I could be the one inspiring others, just 
like you did for me. You've helped a lot, Etie."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Etie] 
Aww, Divine One. You're gonna make me blush."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Etie] 
This seems like a good time for a quick jog. 
I'll see you later!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
Wait! I think I embarrassed her into going on 
another run."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alear] 
Well, that's OK. If I follow her, I can get in a few 
laps around the Somniel myself!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Etie] 2 

[Etie] 
I see you're staring at me again, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
I was. Again. Sorry, I just can't help it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Etie] 
You know I don't mind. It's pretty neat, in fact."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Etie] 
That said, I can think of better ways for you to 
feel good than just admiring my confidence."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
Such as?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Etie] 
A hundred laps around the Somniel!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
Like...running?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Etie] 
Even I get stressed sometimes. And when I do, 
I always go for a run."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Etie] 
As long as I'm running, my mind is empty. 
It's like I'm sweating out all my troubles."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
Huh. Still...are a hundred laps really necessary?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Etie] 
In my experience? Yes. Anything less runs the 
risk of a few stray, lingering doubts."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Etie] 
So how about it? You interested?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
Yes. I think."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Etie] 
Great. Let's get started!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
You mean now?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Etie] 
No time like the present! Do you wanna get 
confident or not?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I hadn't planned on running a hundred laps 
today. But I guess it's worth a try."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
You're on, Etie! Let's go for a run!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Etie] 
Now you're talking!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Etie] 2 

[Alear] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Etie] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Etie] 
What's up? You're looking at me kinda weird."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
Sorry. I didn't mean any offense. I just couldn't 
help it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Etie] 
Is there something wrong with how I look?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alear] 
Oh, no! Nothing like that!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Etie] 
Then tell me why you're laughing already."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
Well, you know how you're always 
so confident?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Etie] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
I was thinking about how plain it is on 
your face."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
There's confidence all over you. It's kind of 
inspiring to look at."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Etie] 
Which is why you were staring."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
Forgive me, Etie. If it bothers you, I'll stop."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Etie] 
Nah, I don't mind. I'm actually a little honored 
to help out the Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Etie] 
If staring at me lifts your mood, go ahead and 
stare all you want."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Thank you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Etie] 
I mean, it's a little embarrassing, but a quick 
jog will help get my mind off it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Etie] 
See you around, Divine One!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Etie] 
What is going on with you lately? You keep 
jogging solo, like you're avoiding me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
The thing is..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Etie] 
If it was something I said or did, I apologize. 
Seriously."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
Let me finish! There's something that's been 
on my mind."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
No matter how much I run, I can't shake it off. 
I don't know what to do."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
Sorry about this, but can I get something off 
my chest?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Etie] 
Go right ahead."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
I'd really like for us to partner up."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Etie] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Etie] 
Sure. That sounds good."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
What?! Just like that?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Etie] 
You mean like training partners, right? Someone 
to spot your workouts?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
Well...that's not exactly it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
I meant supporting each other no matter what. 
That's why I'm giving you the Pact Ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Etie] 
Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Etie] 
For real?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Etie] 
You can't mean that, right? Why would you 
give me something so important?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
Partly because of your confidence. I feel 
stronger just by being around you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
But you're also kindhearted and determined. 
It's the right choice."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
I've been wanting to bring it up for a while now, 
but I was afraid you'd say no."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Etie] 
So that's why you've been jogging alone."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
Yeah."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Etie] 
Well, you can stop worrying. From now on, 
we'll always jog together."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Etie] 
You and me are gonna run side by side for 
a million laps before we're through."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
So you'll accept?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Etie] 
Sure. Whatever I can do to help."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
Thank you! This is such a load off my mind."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Etie] 
Thinking about this has got me all keyed up. 
I could go for a run to burn off the energy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Etie] 
What do you say? Dead sprint around the 
Somniel until we can't move?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Alear] 
That sounds wonderful. I'm ready if you are!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Etie] 
Then let's get moving, . Last one 
back to the Somniel is a rotten egg!"
