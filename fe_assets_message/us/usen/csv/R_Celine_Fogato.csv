[Céline] 
Do you ever get the sense that you and I are 
quite similar?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Fogado] 
I was just thinking that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
We look and act completely different, and yet 
for some reason, we understand each other."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Céline] 
Yes, I know precisely what you mean."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Fogado] 
I guess it makes sense if you think about it. 
We are in similar situations."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Fogado] 
Each of us is second in line to the throne. 
The sovereigns' siblings."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Céline] 
Indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Céline] 
Ever since childhood, I have endeavored to 
grow into a role where I might support the king."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Fogado] 
Same here. I've spent my whole life thinking of 
ways to help my sister."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Fogado] 
That meant becoming stronger than she was. 
Training harder than she did."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Fogado] 
Leaving the palace to resolve conflicts around 
the queendom."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Céline] 
I suspected as much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Céline] 
Likewise, I honed my swordsmanship and 
magical prowess to support my sickly brother."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Céline] 
But wouldn't you know it! Just when I thought 
I'd strengthened myself enough..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Céline] 
my brother seemed to make a full recovery."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Fogado] 
Haha, and you didn't know whether to cheer 
or break down sobbing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Fogado] 
We really are alike."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Céline] 
We both dearly love our siblings, as we love 
our nations."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Fogado] 
And to protect what we love...we'd be willing to 
do the unthinkable."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Céline] 
Precisely. Neither of us would hesitate to 
employ less-than-peaceful means."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Fogado] 
Heh heh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Fogado] 
Good. Each of us knows what a monster the 
other can be."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Céline] 
It's for that reason that I see any path putting 
us in conflict with Solm as risky indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Fogado] 
In that case, let's stay friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Céline] 
May we find a path forward. Together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Fogado] 
Well hello, Princess Céline. You're looking 
gorgeous as ever."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Céline] 
Thank you, Prince Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Fogado] 
So? What do you say? Want to have that cup 
of tea? It's time we got to know each other."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Céline] 
Hmm. Is that wise?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Fogado] 
Oh, come on. You're still mulling it over?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Fogado] 
I guess you can't help being closed off. You are 
Firenese, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Céline] 
As I said, we have a distaste for risk."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Fogado] 
Yeah, but it's not just that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Céline] 
Oh? What else?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Fogado] 
Firene's farming industry is so robust, you don't 
need to keep reserves, let alone import goods."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Fogado] 
And that's a good thing, don't get me wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Fogado] 
But self-sufficiency has made you folks a bit 
unsociable, if you ask me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Fogado] 
Your gates are shut so tight, they might as well 
be walls."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Céline] 
Interesting. When put that way, we do seem 
a bit isolated, don't we?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Céline] 
Very well. I accept your invitation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Céline] 
I'll prove to you that the Firenese people are 
in no way walled off."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Céline] 
Rather, the generosity fostered by our pastoral 
ways makes us exceptionally accommodating."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Fogado] 
Haha! Good for you, Princess Céline!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Fogado] 
Taking it upon yourself to prove Firene isn't 
a hermit kingdom. I respect that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Céline] 
It's also a chance for me to gain a glimpse of 
the secret to your prosperity."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Céline] 
Such as the way you curry favor with foreign 
nobility to pry information out of them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Fogado] 
I won't deny it. As a prince, I occasionally have 
no choice but to mix business and pleasure."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Fogado] 
But no ulterior motives today, I promise. 
Just tea and friendly conversation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Céline] 
That would be lovely. I look forward to it, 
Prince of Solm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Fogado] 
Princess Céline! Did you do something with 
your hair? It's looking even flowier than usual."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Céline] 
Good day, Prince Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Fogado] 
I'll say. Any day I see you is a good one."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Fogado] 
Nothing, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Céline] 
If I reacted to every bit of flattery that spilt from 
your mouth, we'd be here all day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Fogado] 
Flattery? Me? I wouldn't dream of it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Fogado] 
Hey, I know! We should have tea together. 
You like tea, don't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Céline] 
Indeed, I do!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Fogado] 
Being royals of Solm and Firene, I think it's 
important we get to know each other."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Fogado] 
Talk about different values and whatnot. 
Could be beneficial for both of us."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Céline] 
Haha, spoken like the prince of a nation 
obsessed with trade."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Fogado] 
Nothing wrong with a little give and take."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Céline] 
Forgive me, but I must decline for now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Céline] 
The Firenese lifestyle is more pastoral. We lack 
your taste for intrigue and risk."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Fogado] 
You make tea with me sound like some kind of 
big adventure."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Céline] 
Quite a dangerous one, yes. Good day, 
Prince Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Céline] 

[Fogado] 
And just like that, she's gone. Guess this'll take 
some doing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Fogado] 
Then again, what did I expect? She is 
from Firene."
