[Chloé] 
The day we met was a fateful one for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Chloé] 
Ever since, I've kept watch for things that just 
don't happen in real life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Céline] 
Whatever do you mean by that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Chloé] 
Until I met you, I led exactly the kind of life 
you'd expect."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Chloé] 
I'd fantasize about things that might happen in 
stories, but I knew it was just a fantasy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Chloé] 
But the day I met you was the day I found 
myself living in a fairy tale instead."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Chloé] 
And if it could be true for that one day, why 
couldn't it be true all the time?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Céline] 
You certainly have bravery enough to be a fairy- 
tale heroine, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Chloé] 
Oh, Princess Céline. You don't have to 
flatter me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Céline] 
Haha, it was no mere flattery, only the truth."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Céline] 
But you were saying that our meeting started 
a new life for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Chloé] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Chloé] 
That day, I made up my mind to do whatever it 
took to become your knight."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Céline] 
Why is that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Chloé] 
Well, it seemed to me that becoming a knight 
was the only way for me to live my own life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Chloé] 
Rather than the one dictated by my parents─or 
by my birth."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Chloé] 
That day was the turning point, when I began 
my training."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Céline] 
I remember how startled I was to hear that you 
would be my retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Chloé] 
Hmm-hm, I bet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Chloé] 
Now imagine how my family felt about it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Chloé] 
It's no exaggeration to say that meeting you 
changed my life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Céline] 
Oh, Chloé..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Céline] 
I could say the same for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Céline] 
You are a precious friend and a thoroughly 
dependable retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Céline] 
It has been a joy to have you near. Thank you 
for your service, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Céline] 
I look forward to seeing the rest of the fairy tale 
that we weave together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Chloé] 
Me too, Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Chloé] 2 

[Céline] 
Heh heh. Hm-hm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
My goodness. Is my face so funny that you'd 
laugh as soon as you see it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Céline] 
Forgive me, Chloé. Though, I wasn't laughing 
at you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Céline] 
Rather, it was the memory of the first time we 
met that has me so amused."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Chloé] 
Oh yes, how could I forget? My first encounter 
with the princess..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Chloé] 
You were at the harbor with your face 
scrunched up in tears. It was adorable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Céline] 
I wouldn't say I was in tears!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Céline] 
The ship I meant to board couldn't set sail, 
and I was grasping at straws. That's all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Chloé] 
Which is when I made my entrance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Chloé] 
I told you if there was someplace you wanted 
to go, I could give you a ride on my pegasus."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Céline] 
And off we went to the tea farm."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Céline] 
I'd snuck out of the castle incognito before, 
but this was something altogether different."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Céline] 
I'd never ridden a pegasus. I can remember my 
excitement like it was yesterday!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Céline] 
The first of many grand adventures."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Chloé] 
That day is burned into my memory forever."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Chloé] 
When they told me you were the princess, 
I nearly keeled over with shock."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Chloé] 
I mean, how many people make friends with a 
girl who turns out to be royalty?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Céline] 
Heh heh, I'm sorry. I hope it wasn't too hard on 
your nerves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Chloé] 
Oh, it was an honor. Like I was living a real 
fairy tale!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Chloé] 
You might say I started a new life that day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Céline] 
Indeed? You must elaborate."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Chloé] 
Oh, I'd be happy to. But not today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Céline] 
No? I have the time, if that's your concern."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Chloé] 
Hmm-hm! Oh, Princess Céline. The best fairy 
tales leave the audience wanting more."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Chloé] 2 
[Chloé] 
Oh, hello, Princess Céline! You look radiant 
as ever."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Céline] 
Thank you, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Chloé] 
We have some free time today. How do you 
intend to spend it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Céline] 
That's a good question."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Céline] 
Why don't we take a ride on your pegasus to 
a nearby tea farm?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Chloé] 
I'd be thrilled!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Céline] 
Mind you, we don't have that much free time. 
I doubt it would be like it was before."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Céline] 
If only I could return to those days of whiling 
away the hours with you..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Chloé] 
Princess Céline?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Céline] 
Oh well. Let's do something else."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Chloé] 
When this war ends, I'll take you wherever you 
like, as often as you like."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Chloé] 
We'll visit all the tea farms in the world."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Chloé] 
And we can pass the time taking in beautiful 
landscapes while sipping delicious tea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Chloé] 
Now, doesn't that sound lovely?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Céline] 
It does indeed. Wonderful idea, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Céline] 
I shall hold you to it when the time comes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Chloé] 
And I will be happy to oblige."
