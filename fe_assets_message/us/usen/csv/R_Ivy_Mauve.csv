[Mauvier] 
It is strange..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
I always end up telling you about my past. That 
is something I do not normally do with people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
It's the same with me. For some reason, I find 
myself spilling all my secrets to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
Well then, this creates a problem for us both."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Ivy] 
Agreed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Ivy] 
I fear that the closer we become, the more 
likely I am to reveal a weakness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Mauvier] 
Or could it be we are both hoping for such an 
accident to happen to the other?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Ivy] 
We are quite similar indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Mauvier] 
Princess Ivy. You may remember..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Mauvier] 
I strive to be accepted as an ally─by everyone. 
That is my goal, and it drives every decision."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Ivy] 
I remember."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Mauvier] 
I may have been wrong in that way of thinking."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Ivy] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Mauvier] 
If I were accepted by one person, I would be 
happy. Other opinions would be meaningless."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Mauvier] 
With that one person's acceptance, I would be 
in the place I belong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Mauvier] 
So if you are willing to accept me, then..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Mauvier] 
I would know that this is where I belong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Ivy] 
That's a lovely way to think of it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Ivy] 
Let us fight, then, to protect a place where 
we belong. Together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Mauvier] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Ivy] 
And shall we continue spilling our dearest 
secrets to one another?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Mauvier] 
Whatever secrets you spill, I shall be there to 
clean them up, Princess Ivy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Is it true?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Princess Ivy, you worship the Divine Dragon? 
But all of Elusia worships the Fell Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Ivy] 
It is true."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Ivy] 
Every worshipper of the Fell Dragon that I knew 
was a poisonous liar and schemer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Ivy] 
So I chose to rebel and instead prayed to the 
Divine Dragon. In private, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Mauvier] 
You had a considerable amount of courage for 
a young princess."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Ivy] 
Thinking back on it, perhaps I did..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Ivy] 
You are also from Elusia, are you not? 
Do you worship the Fell Dragon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Mauvier] 
I was born in Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Mauvier] 
When I was young, my father fell ill and died. 
Afterward, my mother and I traveled to Elusia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Mauvier] 
Mother's prayers to the Divine Dragon hadn't 
saved Father. We changed deities as a result."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Ivy] 
Ah."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Ivy] 
And how is your mother now?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Mauvier] 
My mother died soon after we began our 
new lives."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Mauvier] 
I was raised in a church in Elusia, alongside 
the other orphans."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Ivy] 
I didn't realize. I'm so sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Mauvier] 
I have nothing to hide."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Mauvier] 
I was educated by Fell Dragon believers, but I 
cannot say I was ever truly devoted."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Mauvier] 
As with my mother, I found that my deity was 
not interested in me or my desires for peace."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Ivy] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Ivy] 
So you were surrounded by the Fell Dragon's 
followers, yet you chose not to follow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Mauvier] 
I have rarely admitted such to anyone else, but, 
yes, I suppose we are similar in that way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Ivy] 
Hmm, quite. I wonder what else we might have 
in common."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 

[Ivy] 
Excuse me, Mauvier?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Princess Ivy? How may I help?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Ivy] 
I was hoping we could speak."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Ivy] 
We find ourselves in similar circumstances."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Mauvier] 
Similar circumstances? Oh, I think I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Mauvier] 
We have each stood as enemies before those we 
now call our allies."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Ivy] 
Exactly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
In light of that, Mauvier, do you feel this is 
where you truly belong now?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Mauvier] 
I...am unsure."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Mauvier] 
There are those who accept me, but I do not 
believe everyone does yet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Mauvier] 
I feel comfortable here, but that means nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Mauvier] 
I am behaving as if all is well, yet I do so 
lacking any evidence that it is so."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Ivy] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Mauvier] 
Still, I have no intentions of leaving."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Mauvier] 
I have dedicated myself to helping others, and 
with that, I hope to find acceptance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Mauvier] 
And a new place for myself in this world."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Ivy] 
I understand entirely."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Ivy] 
For whatever it's worth, let me say that 
I accept and welcome you as a friend."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Ivy] 
Speaking as someone who would also benefit 
from hearing those same words from our allies."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Mauvier] 
Thank you for your candor, Princess Ivy."
