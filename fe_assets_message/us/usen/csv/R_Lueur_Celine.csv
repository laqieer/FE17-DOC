[Céline] 
If I worried you the other day, Divine One, 
I sincerely apologize."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
What happened to the highwaymen attacking 
those tea shipments?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Céline] 
We supplied funds to heighten the caravan's 
security."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Céline] 
Then they let the thieves escape, which led our 
new security forces directly to their stronghold."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Céline] 
I just came from giving the order to eliminate 
their base."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Céline] 
They are bandits, but they are still Firenese, 
and I have now signed their death warrant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Céline] 
I would do it again without hesitation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Céline] 
No one─not one soul─can be suffered to 
violate Firene's peace."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
But it must have been a painful choice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Céline] 
It wasn't."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Céline] 
Anguish is one of the few privileges not 
afforded to those in my position."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
Hmm... I know you have to harden your heart, 
but you have a heart all the same."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Céline] 
Your empathy is appreciated."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Céline] 
There is nothing I would not do to protect 
my kingdom."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Céline] 
I would draw my blade for peace without 
hesitation. I have steeled myself for it all my life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Céline] 
Even so..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Céline] 
I find no satisfaction in what must be done."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Céline] 
I worry that is a mark of weakness in me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
That's not weakness. It's kindness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
It's the same kindness that's reflected in the 
Firenese character."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Céline] 
You are most generous, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Céline] 2 

[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
You're looking a bit grim, Céline. Problems?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Céline] 
Ah, Divine One. Do you remember the tea we 
enjoyed together the other day?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
It was so good that I'm not likely to forget it 
anytime soon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Céline] 
It would appear that shipments of those leaves 
are becoming a favorite target for highwaymen."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Céline] 
Changing the trade routes has made little 
difference. Each day brings more victims."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
That's awful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Céline] 
I am not often called on to intervene directly in 
matters such as this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Céline] 
But this is an emergency, and no one in Firene 
knows more of tea than I."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Céline] 
So Mother has requested that I handle the 
problem personally."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
How do you feel about that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Céline] 
I suspect it may be part of my education."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Céline] 
Even if my brother is first in line for the throne, 
I am still princess of Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
So what's your plan for dealing with them?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Céline] 
I thought I might drive them off with pranks."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Céline] 
Ah, wouldn't it be lovely if things were as 
simple as they are in folktales?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Céline] 
But real life isn't so...pastoral."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
No, it's not."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Céline] 
I will show no mercy to anyone who causes 
suffering to the people of Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Céline] 
And I will go to any lengths so that my people 
may enjoy the peace they are accustomed to."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Céline] 
Don't look at me like that, Divine One. This is a 
duty I must bear."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Céline] 
Now then, please excuse me. Action must 
be taken in this matter...swiftly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Céline] 2 

[Alear] 
I really enjoyed our tea party today. Thanks for 
inviting me, Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Céline] 
The pleasure is all mine, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Céline] 
Our conversation made for an excellent spice 
over an already fine tea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
The tea was fine, wasn't it? That floral note it 
had was almost unbelievably good."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Céline] 
I'm glad you appreciated it. The leaves were 
grown in Firene, you know."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Céline] 
The delicate, subtle taste embodies the spirit 
of our kingdom."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Céline] 
It is my utmost favorite."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
Yeah, I've heard the Firenese prefer the pastoral 
life over any kind of open conflict."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
That really came through in this tea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Céline] 
There's a Firenese folktale I think you might 
find interesting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Céline] 
Our royal palace is home to a spirit who 
ensures happiness for the virtuous."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Céline] 
For thieves or interlopers, however, the spirit 
drives them off with mischievous tricks."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Céline] 
Hahaha, imagine! Driven off by the prankish 
antics of a spirit!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Céline] 
No serious consequences at all. How effective a 
deterrent do you suppose such a spirit really is?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alear] 
Even so, it's a lovely story."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
It's the kind of goodhearted tale that reflects 
the Firenese character, I think."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Céline] 
Yes... Yes, it is. Well then, we must have tea 
together again sometime, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Céline] 2 

[Céline] 
Divine One, might I have a word?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Of course, Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Céline] 
It concerns a matter we spoke of previously."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Céline] 
I told you that I would not hesitate to draw my 
blade for the sake of my nation."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Céline] 
That to bring peace to my people, I would 
wage war."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
Yes, I remember."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Céline] 
Yet now I find my resolve wavering."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Céline] 
I wonder whether I could truly be so merciless 
in the pursuit of peace."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
That's understandable for someone so kind 
as you, Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Céline] 
It is not kindness! It is a sort of...cowardice."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Céline] 
The unique cowardice that comes of what 
others may think. I fear that you would hate me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Céline] 
Therefore I ask that you hold me in contempt."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Céline] 
Scorn me for putting my personal feelings 
ahead of my royal duties."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Céline] 
If I already bore your disappointment, I could 
again be merciless for the sake of my people."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
I think you should have this, Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Céline] 
Is this...the Pact Ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
You could never disappoint me. I'll always be 
there to support you, whatever you decide."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
Whether it's for the kingdom of Firene or for 
yourself. Whatever your motivations..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
I will stand by you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Céline] 
Then...you see nothing to loathe in my 
steel heart?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
No. I know there's more to your heart than that. 
Whatever decisions you feel you have to make..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
We can work through the consequences 
together. You don't have to be alone."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Céline] 
Thank you, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Céline] 
With you at my side, what reason would I have 
for cowardice?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Céline] 
I should find only joy instead."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Céline] 
Divine One, your unwavering support has lifted 
a great weight from me. You are a true friend."
