♪Mmm mmm mmm...♪"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Seadall] 
Pandreo."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Oh. Hey, Seadall. If you're trying to spring 
another lesson on me, I'm not interested."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Seadall] 
After everything I taught you...your rhythm is 
still just so awful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Pandreo] 
So...what? Did you come here only to 
insult me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Seadall] 
No, not at all. Honestly, I was just watching you 
dance...and I realized that I was wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Pandreo] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Seadall] 
Enjoying the dance─that's what's important."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Seadall] 
I decided to teach you because I thought you 
were having a hard time with it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Seadall] 
That's how it looked, anyway. But just now, 
you were dancing and loving it. I could see it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Pandreo] 
I mean, yeah. I was having fun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Seadall] 
That's all that matters."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Seadall] 
If my master heard me now, he'd be angry with 
me. But it's something I needed to learn."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Seadall] 
Pandreo, I'm sorry I taught you not to 
enjoy dancing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Listen, Seadall."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Pandreo] 
I just wanted to dance with you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Seadall] 
Really?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Pandreo] 
Yeah. And I still want to. It's just that your 
lesson wasn't really my style."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Pandreo] 
What do you say? Want to give it another try?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Seadall] 
I'd be happy to."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Seadall] 
Just dance to the beat of your heart. You can't 
go wrong if you do that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Pandreo] 
That's what I'm talking about! Come on, time to 
shimmy and shake in the name of fun! Ha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Pandreo] 
And then...how about another lesson? Nothing 
too tough. Just a quick, easy session."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Seadall] 
Haha, I promise, my next lesson will be much 
more enjoyable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1

[Seadall] 
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
Two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Ughhh!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Seadall, you're counting wrong! It's messing 
up my flow!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Seadall] 
No. You're not staying on the beat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Pandreo] 
I can't help it! I've been dancing to my own 
beat for so long."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Seadall] 
Hmm. We have to break your old habits and 
really hammer home a solid foundation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Pandreo] 
You're saying I can't dance the way I want?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Seadall] 
I'm sorry, but no. It's for your own good."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Urgh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Seadall] 
Look, when I started, I couldn't dance a single 
step. But my master worked with me, tirelessly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Seadall] 
Sometimes the training was so hard, I wanted to 
run away. But now, I'm grateful for all of it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Seadall] 
And now I can teach you to dance, Pandreo, 
just like my master taught me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Pandreo] 
I never asked you to do that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Seadall] 
But...I thought you wanted to learn to dance?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Pandreo] 
I wanted to have fun, and this? This is not fun."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Thanks for your tutelage or whatever. Brief as 
it was."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Seadall] 
Pandreo, wait! The lesson's not over!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
At last... I think I finally got the steps down."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Pandreo] 
Seadall, your movement is so...graceful."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Seadall] 
As it should be. I am a professional dancer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Pandreo] 
You know, watching you is giving me the urge 
to cut a rug myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Pandreo] 
What do you say? Wanna dance together?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Seadall] 
Yes, if you'd like."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Pandreo] 
Flawless finish! That ought to go down in 
history as the best dance ever!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Seadall] 
Eh, Pandreo..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Seadall] 
I've never danced like...that. The movements... 
they don't match the rhythm. At all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Seadall] 
I understand why the others call it the Dance of 
Darkness. What a grotesque pantomime."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Pandreo] 
Really? I had a great time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Seadall] 
A great time? Is that enough for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Um... Define ""enough."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Seadall] 
I take it you like to dance, yes? Well, to really 
and truly dance, you have to work at it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Pandreo] 
Hmm. So that's how it goes, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Seadall] 
Yes, that's exactly how it goes. But don't worry, 
I'll teach you to dance correctly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Pandreo] 
All right, if you insist! I doubt it'll take me too 
long to pick it up."
