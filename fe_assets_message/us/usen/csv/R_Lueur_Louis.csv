[Louis] 2 
[Louis] 
Thank you for your help, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Louis] 
I always have such trouble deciding on gifts to 
buy for my brothers."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
It was nothing. I'm sure they'd be thrilled to get 
any gift from their big brother."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
How's the letter going, by the way? You said 
you were going to send one with the gifts?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Louis] 
That was my original intent, but I think 
I've reconsidered."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
Why's that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Louis] 
Well, the purpose of the letter and gifts was that 
I wasn't sure when next I shall be home."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Louis] 
But when it came time to put pen to paper, 
I found myself merely staring at the blank page."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
I wouldn't worry about the best way to say it. 
Just write whatever you feel."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Louis] 
Something from the heart..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Louis] 
""How are you? I am doing well."" Ugh, those are 
the beginnings of a rather childish letter."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
No, it's like the gift. They'll be happy to hear 
from you no matter what you say."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
The important thing it to make it clear. Take any 
chance you get to tell them how you feel."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Louis] 
Wise words..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Louis] 
You are correct, of course. Thank you. I shall 
include a letter after all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Louis] 
And so long as I'm writing to them, I shall tell 
them all about you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
Me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Louis] 
My brothers should know how wonderful 
you are."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Louis] 
You won't object to me introducing a precious 
friend to my family, will you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
Aw, Louis. You're embarrassing me. But yeah, 
that'd be nice."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Louis] 2 
[Louis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
Hi, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Louis] 
Ah! Greetings, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
Are you doing your people-watching thing 
again? I can leave if I'm interrupting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Louis] 
Oh, you weren't interrupting anything. I was 
thinking about my family."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Louis] 
I left three younger brothers behind back in 
my hometown."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
So you're the oldest?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Louis] 
Yes, I am the oldest of us four."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
Wow. It must have been tough being the 
big brother."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Louis] 
I suppose so, from a certain point of view."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Louis] 
Our mother passed away before her time, so it 
was up to me to raise them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Louis] 
But I love them nonetheless. We all muddled 
through together somehow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
Maybe taking care of them is how you got to be 
such a good retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Louis] 
You know, you may be right. It takes quite a bit 
to ruffle me, as it were."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Louis] 
And now that I consider it...growing up in that 
way may have given rise to my little hobby."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
How so?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Louis] 
Spending one's youth in an all-male household 
gives one a rather narrow view of the world."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
I... I guess."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
Do your kid brothers do it too?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Louis] 
They do not."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alear] 
That kind of pokes a hole in your theory, then. 
I think it might just be you, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Louis] 
Haha, the mystery deepens."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Louis] 2 

[Alear] 
Louis? What are you doing there?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Louis] 
Oh, hello, Divine One. I wasn't doing anything 
of note, really."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Louis] 
Merely observing those two over there chatting 
with one another."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
Um, OK. And you're doing that...why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Louis] 
That is the question, is it not?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Louis] 
There are all sorts of philosophical implications 
to the simple act of asking, ""Why?"""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Louis] 
To which I suppose I would respond... 
for edification."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
So you watch people chat in order to 
learn things?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Louis] 
Precisely. There is deep meaning in these 
seemingly simple encounters."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Louis] 
Through observation, many delightful and 
subtle details reveal themselves."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Louis] 
When one treats them as one would treat a 
gallery piece, can there possibly be any harm?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
There, uh... I think maybe there can."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
What's right or wrong goes beyond rules and 
laws. There's courtesy and decency."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
If you knew they didn't like being watched, 
you'd stop, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Louis] 
But of course, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Louis] 
I would never elevate my appreciation above 
their own comfort."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Just so we're clear. Well then, I guess...I'll leave 
you to it..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Louis] 
Very good, Divine One. I trust that I have eased 
any concerns you had."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Louis] 2 

[Alear] 
Sorry to keep you waiting. What was it you 
wanted to talk about?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Louis] 
Thank you for taking the time to meet with me, 
Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Louis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
Um...Louis?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Louis] 
Would you care for some tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
I'm fine, thanks. So you wanted to discuss 
something?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Louis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
You're fidgeting a lot today. What's going on?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Louis] 
My apologies. I had hoped my anxieties would 
be less obvious for all the world to see."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Louis] 
I brought you here to ask a straightforward 
question."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Louis] 
Yet my hands are shaking, my face is flushed 
with sweat, and my feet feel leaden."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
If something is bothering you, just ask, and I'll 
help in whatever way I can."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Louis] 
It's my brothers, you see. They strongly wish to 
meet you once the war ends."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
Is that all? Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Louis] 
That's not all. It's the reason they wish to meet 
you that has me so flustered. How to put this..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Louis] 
It would seem my brothers have discovered 
just what you mean to me, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Louis] 
The letter I sent them contained some...effusive 
praise for you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Louis] 
In their reply, they said that they absolutely 
must meet this person I spoke of so gushingly."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Louis] 
They even included our mother's heirloom ring 
that I might present it to you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
So that's it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Louis] 
I apologize for putting you in this predicament."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
What a beautiful ring. And you're giving it 
to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Louis] 
Pardon?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Louis] 
Yes. It would make me happy for you to have it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
You've had so much practice caring for your 
family that I'd feel lucky for you to care for me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Alear] 
That's why I have a matching gift for you, 
if you'll take it. It's the Pact Ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Louis] 
You're too kind, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Louis] 
When this war is over, we must visit my home 
and sample the grapes it's famous for."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Alear] 
I'd like that. And I'd like to meet your family 
as well, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033,"[Louis] 
It feels odd to step out of serving you and grow 
so close. But it's a step I'm happy I took."
