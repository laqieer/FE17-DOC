[Timerra] 
♪Fry, fry, fry! Get nice and crispy!♪"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Oh... Oh no..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
The smells found me and pulled me back 
once again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Seadall] 
I couldn't help myself. I'm so sorry, 
Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Timerra] 
Relax, Seadall."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Timerra] 
I lured you here on purpose."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Seadall] 
You lured me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Timerra] 
Yup. I did some digging and found out you 
prefer your meat fried."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Seadall] 
Why would you do that to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Timerra] 
Uh-oh! Watch out, Seadall! It's a fried meat 
sandwich!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Seadall] 
Oh no! That's my favorite food!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Timerra] 
I know!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Timerra] 
Oh, here's another one. It's got a honey glaze 
and a creamy cheese sauce."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Seadall] 
Ahh! That's my other favorite food!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Seadall] 
Princess Timerra, why?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Seadall] 
Why would you make the food that's hardest 
for me to resist? What are you thinking?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Timerra] 
I'm thinking you should do more than just eat 
bland food all the time!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Seadall] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Seadall] 
Don't you see? My whole life is discipline. My 
dancing in and out of battle depends on it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Timerra] 
Look. As the next queen of Solm, all I want is 
for my people to be happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Timerra] 
So let me ask you... What would make 
you happy?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Seadall] 
In this moment, what would make me happy...is 
eating the things in front of me─all the things."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Timerra] 
Then why fret? Do what makes you happy!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Timerra] 
Look. Enjoy this delicious meal with me, and 
then afterward..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Timerra] 
I'll treat myself to some delightful dancing with 
you. Is it a deal?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Seadall] 
But, Princess Timerra..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Timerra] 
I promise, a little indulgence never hurt anyone. 
Am I right or am I right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Seadall] 
Yes. You're right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Seadall] 
Thank you. Mmm...just look at all the incredible 
food you made for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Seadall] 
Here I go. It's high time I live a little."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Timerra] 
That's the spirit! Come on, dig in before it 
gets cold!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Seadall] 
Let the feast of flavors begin!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Timerra] 
♪Mmm mmm mmm! Tasty, tasty meat. So nice 
and chewyyy!♪"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Agh!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Timerra] 
Oh no. Don't you start."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Seadall] 
Again? You're breaking your promise again?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Seadall] 
I can smell it! You've got one of your too-tasty 
dishes on the grill. Oh, the sizzling!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Timerra] 
Relax, would you? You're acting weird again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Timerra] 
I mean, you're a world-renowned dancer─not to 
mention a famous fortune-teller!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Timerra] 
People say you're so dignified, so composed. 
I used to dream of meeting the great Seadall."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Seadall] 
Are you disappointed?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Timerra] 
No. About 90 percent of the time, you live up to 
the hype. You act different around, er, flavor?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Seadall] 
My apologies, Princess Timerra. I blame 
the meat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Seadall] 
The way you prepare your dishes, the bold 
flavors are just beyond delicious."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Timerra] 
Tell me something I don't know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Seadall] 
Princess Timerra..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Seadall] 
Why do you always start roasting meat when 
I'm around?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Timerra] 
That's not quite what's happening, is it? Come 
on. Give it another think."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Timerra] 
The truth is, when I've got a good roast going, 
you find me and barge in."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Seadall] 
So, you're saying...I'm doing this to myself?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Timerra] 
Yup!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Seadall] 
I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Seadall] 
Allow me to apologize, Princess Timerra. You 
didn't break your promise."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Seadall] 
I simply lack willpower. That's my fault, 
not yours."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Seadall] 
I'll make sure I don't come looking for you when 
you're cooking with such...flair and flavor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Seadall] 
If you'll excuse me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Seadall] 

[Timerra] 
Seadall, wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Timerra] 
♪Mmm mmm mmm...♪"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Seadall] 2 

[Seadall] 
Agh!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Timerra] 
Yikes! Seadall, what's with the shouting?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Seadall] 
This was not part of the deal, Princess Timerra! 
You're breaking your promise!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Timerra] 
Yeah, no. I'm drawing a blank here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Seadall] 
The deal was, you wouldn't cook your 
roast-meat specialties around me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Seadall] 
Look at this! Smell this! Your dishes have far 
more flavor than any dish should. You promised."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Timerra] 
Oooh. That does ring a bell, now that you 
mention it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Timerra] 
Something about...big flavors being a big 
distraction? Er, my roasts, most of all?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Seadall] 
You swore you wouldn't cook your dishes near 
me. Yet here you are─you and your meat!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Seadall] 
Everything I eat is carefully chosen to guide my 
dancing. Now, I want to stuff that in my mouth!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Timerra] 
Oh, sure! Have at it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Seadall] 
Ugh!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Seadall] 
Spirit of the cards! Cast your divine light and 
show me how to defeat this demon's trap!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Timerra] 
Demon?! I was trying to be polite!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Timerra] 
If it bothers you that much, why not go away 
and let me eat in peace?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Seadall] 
Oh, I'll leave all right. I will go far, far, far away. 
I will beat this trial, you'll see!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Seadall] 
Moon and stars, I beg of you...keep me from 
this meaty temptation!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Seadall] 

[Timerra] 
Yeesh. That was weird."
