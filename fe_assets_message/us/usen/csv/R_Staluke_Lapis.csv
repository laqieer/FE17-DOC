MID_RELIANCE_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Lapis] 2 
[Lapis] 
I vow to protect you, Prince Alcryst!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Lapis?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
Like I keep saying, I'm your retainer. Protecting 
you is my job."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
But I'm not doing this because I have to."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Lapis] 
I want to protect you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alcryst] 
Why in the world would you want to protect 
me? I'm not worth it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lapis] 
That! That right there. That's what I'm talking 
about when I say that you have no idea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alcryst] 
You said that last time─that I had no idea how 
you felt."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lapis] 
It's not about my feelings, Prince Alcryst. 
You have no idea how great you really are."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alcryst] 
How...great I am?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lapis] 
You're so, so perceptive. You always know so 
much about other people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Lapis] 
Yet you choose to focus on each person's best 
qualities. You find skills no one else notices."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Lapis] 
I can't even count all the times you've lifted me 
up by reminding me what I'm good at."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alcryst] 
It's easy to notice those things when everyone 
else is more skilled than I am. Drastically so."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Lapis] 
No, that's not true. It's because you're a kind 
person, Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lapis] 
You're skilled and kind and so charming..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Lapis] 
Yet you'd throw your life away to keep others 
safe─even the retainers who protect you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Lapis] 
Do you really think that's supposed to make 
me happy?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alcryst] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alcryst] 
In that case...what if we form an alliance 
of protection?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lapis] 
What does that mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alcryst] 
It means I will vow to protect you...and accept 
your protection of me. And you'll do the same."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alcryst] 
That way, we both protect someone we care for 
and accept that we are cared for in return."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lapis] 
Heh, much better. You finally sound like the 
kind prince that you are. Count me in."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alcryst] 
I'm glad to hear it. Let's try this again, but 
together this time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alcryst] 
I vow to protect you, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Lapis] 
And I vow to protect you, Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alcryst] 
Thank you...and I accept."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Lapis] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Lapis? I want to apologize for making that vow 
the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Lapis] 
Oh, but, Prince Alcryst. Please don't worry 
about it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lapis] 
I should apologize for trying to tell you what 
you're allowed to say."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alcryst] 
You did nothing wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alcryst] 
It was my mistake. I didn't consider how my 
words would make you feel."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alcryst] 
However...there is one thing I'll stand by."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alcryst] 
I really do think that you're an amazing 
person, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lapis] 
That's not... I'm really not that amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alcryst] 
You are. I know that you are."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alcryst] 
I know that you always send part of your pay 
back home to support your family."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alcryst] 
I also know you spend your free time subduing 
dangerous beasts that enter the area."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lapis] 
How did you...find out about..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alcryst] 
You're so much more valuable to this world 
than I am, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alcryst] 
That's why I─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lapis] 
That's why you keep saying that you should be 
protecting me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lapis] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Lapis] 
Prince Alcryst... You have no idea..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Lapis] 
It breaks my heart to hear you talk like this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Lapis] 
I'm sorry... I have to go."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Lapis] 

[Alcryst] 
Wow... I really am useless."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alcryst] 
I can't even let a close retainer know how much 
I appreciate her without upsetting her..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alcryst] 
I'm unfit to be anyone's master."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Lapis] 2 

[Alcryst] 
I vow to protect you, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
Prince Alcryst? What are you talking about?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 
You kept me safe during battle the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Lapis] 
Of course I did. I'm your retainer. It's my duty 
to keep you safe."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alcryst] 
Yes, but I don't deserve it. I'm useless, but your 
character and skills have real value."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alcryst] 
That's why, from now on, I vow to protect 
you in battle, Lapis!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lapis] 
Wh─"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alcryst] 
But then, I suppose those words are hollow 
coming from someone as unreliable as me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lapis] 
That makes three."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alcryst] 
What?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Lapis] 
This is the third time you've vowed to protect 
me like this, Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alcryst] 
Oh. Yes. Now that you mention it, I do recall 
saying it...just after we met."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alcryst] 
And then again at the Grand Crossing, if I'm 
recalling correctly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lapis] 
That's right. Hearing you say those words, 
it made me..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Lapis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lapis] 
Please stop trying to switch our duties like this. 
I'm just a retainer. You're a prince."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alcryst] 
I─ I'm sorry. I'm just being honest about how 
I see things."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Lapis] 
No, I know that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Lapis] 
But I don't think many retainers would be OK 
with their master taking a hit for them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alcryst] 
I...apologize."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Lapis] 
Oh, please don't take it hard. I know how you 
meant it. I appreciate the thought...OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Alcryst] 
Yes...of course."
