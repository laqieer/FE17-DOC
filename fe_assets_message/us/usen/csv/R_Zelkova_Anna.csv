[Zelkov] 
Steel yourself. You are about to witness a 
*simple* design honed by artistic prowess."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Well? What is your opinion of this sculpture? 
Is it up to your *standards* of quality?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Anna] 
Ehh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Anna] 
I was hoping for better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Zelkov] 
What brings you to say this *hurtful* thing?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Anna] 
I know I said it has to be much simpler if you 
want it to sell."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Anna] 
But you're an artist! I wasn't expecting you to 
cave so easily."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Anna] 
After you went on and on about passion, I kinda 
hoped you'd refuse to budge on that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Zelkov] 
Heh-heh. You are quite *mistaken.* In fact, 
you could not be more wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Anna] 
Huh? But..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Zelkov] 
The *appearance* of simplicity in this sculpture 
is but a carefully crafted facade."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Zelkov] 
Its design is *actually* beautifully intricate."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Anna] 
Run that by me again?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Zelkov] 
I began by crafting a sculpture which contained 
every layer of *intricacy* I could ever desire."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Zelkov] 
That done, I added atop these yet another 
layer...to *obscure* how intricate it was."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Zelkov] 
The result is my most *complex* work to date. 
One that, at a glance, appears utterly simple."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Zelkov] 
You may now stand in *awe* of its glory."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Anna] 
I had no idea. That's amazing...almost too 
amazing, if you ask me. It makes no sense!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Anna] 
But─and I hate to say so─this won't sell either."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Zelkov] 
What? Why not?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Anna] 
You can't guess? It's way too intricate. I'd go 
broke trying to manufacture them!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Anna] 
Plus, high production costs mean high prices, 
and customers tend not to like those."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Zelkov] 
Ugh, I *suppose* you have a point."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Anna] 
But I'll buy it from you anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Zelkov] 
You will?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Anna] 
I was really impressed by the way you think."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Anna] 
I never thought much about passion, but it's 
incredibly important for a merchant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Anna] 
Without it, how could I hope to make it as an 
independent entrepreneur?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Anna] 
So I want to buy this from you and keep it close 
at hand. That way I won't forget this feeling."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Zelkov] 
Anna..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Anna] 
Lady Anna."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Zelkov] 
Lady Anna..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Anna] 
Haha, that's better. Mind you, I can't pay much 
for it. One gold's my best offer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Zelkov] 
So *little*..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Zelkov] 
But I *suppose* it is not a matter of gold."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Zelkov] 
If this transaction will benefit you, Lady Anna, 
then it is a *meaningful* one to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Zelkov] 
Best of luck to you, young merchant. I earnestly 
*hope* for your great success."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038,"[Anna] 
Aww, thanks! You know, you're a much nicer 
guy than you came off to be at first."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#039,"[Anna] 
Do you want to share some sweets? I've got 
a private stock of some really great ones."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#040,"[Zelkov] 
I will happily partake."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Anna] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Anna] 
This is your stash of good stuff, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Zelkov] 
Indeed. Behold my various *creations.* 
Paintings, sculptures, candles... I *have* it all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Zelkov] 
Each piece has been lovingly *crafted* by yours 
truly. Help yourself to anything you like."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Zelkov] 
Certainly any item contained on these shelves 
would fetch you a *tidy* profit."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Anna] 
Ehh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Anna] 
Yeah... Uh, sad to say, but I don't think any of 
this is salable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Zelkov] 
I *beg* your pardon? Why ever not?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Anna] 
All of this is good stuff, don't get me wrong. 
But I can tell right off that they're too fiddly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Anna] 
A good piece of merchandise has to be simple 
if you wanna sell it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Zelkov] 
*Balderdash.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Zelkov] 
A creator's *passion* is the literal source of the 
creation's value. It is what a customer pays for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Anna] 
Afraid not. I get why you'd think that, but that 
mindset's a little old-fashioned nowadays."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Anna] 
My generation has its own tastes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Zelkov] 
Ugh... Such *humiliation*..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Zelkov] 
Very well. Soon I will *fashion* a work which is 
certain to delight you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Zelkov] 
You will be left entirely *speechless.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Anna] 
Haha, if you think you can pull that off, go 
ahead and try. I'm eager to see it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Anna] 2 
[Anna] 
Hello, Zelkov! I'm Anna, but you can call me 
Lady Anna for short. Nice meeting you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
What a delightful *child* you are. What can I do 
for you, child? What is it you need?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Anna] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Zelkov] 
Is there anything I can *get* for you? 
Are you getting enough to eat?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Anna] 
I'm not hungry, if that's what you're asking me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Zelkov] 
I hope I am not *frightening* you. That is not at 
all my intention."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Anna] 
Who says I'm scared? Real merchants like me 
see all kinds in our line of work."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Anna] 
If I wanted sweets, I'd just buy some 
from myself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Zelkov] 
I *see.* Well...good."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Anna] 
Which brings me back to why I'm here─you 
should buy something."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Yes, of course. *Show* me your merchandise."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Anna] 
Sure thing!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Zelkov] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Anna] 
I'm not sure I like the sound of that sigh."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Zelkov] 
I am afraid to *say* there is nothing here 
worth purchasing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Anna] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Zelkov] 
While it grieves me to speak so harshly to a 
child, these goods are *worthless* to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Anna] 
Hang on just a minute! What's wrong with 
the stuff I sell?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Zelkov] 
If I must harden my heart to *explain*...so be it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Zelkov] 
There is no *passion* in your products."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Anna] 
What's that supposed to mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Zelkov] 
I can see how *failing* to understand that would 
lead you to sell these things in the first place."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Anna] 
Excuse me?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Zelkov] 
A product must bear the indelible *mark* of its 
creator's passion. It has no value otherwise."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#025,"[Anna] 
What's the difference even between a product 
with passion and one without?! Show me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#026,"[Zelkov] 
Very well. I possess *many* such wonders. 
I would be happy to show them to you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#027,"[Anna] 
This oughta be good..."
