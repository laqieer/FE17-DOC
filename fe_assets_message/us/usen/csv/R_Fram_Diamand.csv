[Framme] 
Hmm. Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Diamant] 2 
[Diamant] 
I'm surprised to see you staring at that history 
book again, Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
I thought you quit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Framme] 
Well..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Framme] 
I want to apologize, Prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Framme] 
You plan on stopping your kingdom's wars, no 
matter how hard that might be. Right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Framme] 
I spent some time thinking about that and 
realized something important."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Framme] 
I shouldn't let history scare me into quitting. 
In fact, that's a good reason to read more!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Framme] 
Now I'm looking through this history book for 
ways to end conflict and warfare."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Diamant] 
Framme... That's really great. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Framme] 
Well, I haven't found any good ideas yet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Diamant] 
That's OK. Even if you don't find any ideas, 
what matters is that you chose to act."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Framme] 
Yeah. We can't change the past, but we can 
change the present and aim for a better future."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Diamant] 
I certainly intend for my mark on history to 
be a bright one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Framme] 
Is that a promise?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Diamant] 
It is. I promise, Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Framme] 
Good. Then I'm going to keep educating myself 
and do everything I can to help."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Diamant] 
If that's the case, I'll help with your studies."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Framme] 
You?! Help with my studies? No way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Framme] 
You're a crown prince. I know you're too busy 
to waste time on my ""Vander homework."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Diamant] 
Not at all. Plus, despite what you might assume, 
I've always been a pretty good student."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Framme] 
With you, ""pretty good"" probably means ""super, 
impossibly perfect."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Diamant] 
Let's call it ""good enough."" I'm sure Vander will 
approve of a partner to keep you focused."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Diamant] 
Shall we hit the books as a team and map out 
our path to peace?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Framme] 
Oh, OK. You talked me into it. Thank you, 
Diamant. My future's looking brighter already!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Framme] 
I'll become a wise steward...and name-drop 
the king of Brodia as my former study buddy!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Framme] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Diamant] 2 
[Diamant] 
Hello, Framme. Did you forget the history book 
today? Or did you already finish it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Framme] 
I...quit studying history."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Diamant] 
You quit? What happened? I thought you were 
finally having fun with it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Framme] 
Prince Diamant... You said you wanted to bring 
peace to the world, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Framme] 
Is that really true?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Diamant] 
Of course it is. I would never lie about that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Framme] 
Then why does Brodia keep attacking Elusia?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Diamant] 
Well..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Framme] 
I read the histories of both kingdoms. There are 
helpless citizens in Elusia that fear Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Framme] 
When you talk about ending war, do you really 
mean conquering Elusia? Is that peace?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Framme] 
The more I read in that history book, the less 
I understood the world. It was scary."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Framme] 
That's why I put it down. I'm done. I quit."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Diamant] 
Brodia...is a kingdom of warriors. It does have a 
regrettable history of seizing territory by force."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Diamant] 
And it is true that some people in Elusia have 
been hurt by─and have grown to hate─Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Diamant] 
That's an undeniable part of my kingdom's 
past, but I won't let it be part of our future."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Diamant] 
It may not be easy, but I mean what I say. 
There will be change."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Framme] 
In your own kingdom, you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Diamant] 
Yes. Please, believe me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Framme] 
I don't know... You skipped right over the bad 
parts of Brodia's history last time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Diamant] 
I didn't mean to hide any of that from you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Diamant] 
But...I suppose I have a guilty conscience about 
these things."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Diamant] 
I understand why you'd be upset with me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Framme] 
No, no. I'm not upset. I just..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Framme] 
Ugh, I don't know. I'm really letting this get 
to me, huh? History is so heavy..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Framme] 
Hmm. Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Diamant] 2 
[Diamant] 
Who's winning the staring contest, you or that 
history book?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Framme] 
Ah! Prince Diamant! Sorry, I didn't notice you 
come in."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Diamant] 
No need to apologize, Framme. What's got you 
so frustrated? Anything I can help with?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Framme] 
I messed up some of my steward duties again, 
so Vander gave me an ongoing ""study duty."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Framme] 
He was all, ""You never take your role seriously,"" 
and, ""The least you can do is educate yourself!"""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Diamant] 
Ah, so Vander gave you that book. Doesn't look 
like you're enjoying it very much."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Framme] 
History is so boring! It's just wars, border 
disputes, wars, trade stuff, more wars..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Framme] 
Why does everyone have to fight all the time? 
Why can't everyone just relax and be friends?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Diamant] 
History does tend to be a chronicle of warfare. 
That's been true since the first Fell Dragon war."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Diamant] 
It's not all battles and bloodshed, though. 
For instance..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Diamant] 
My ancestors were able to found Brodia thanks 
to Lumera's protection, not open warfare."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Diamant] 
You really do learn a lot by studying history. 
Vander has the right idea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Framme] 
Eh. If you say so..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Diamant] 
Heh, just keep reading. It's not all dates and 
trivia, I promise. These are stories about people."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Framme] 
Yeah, I guess you're right. I haven't even made 
it very far... It's kind of draining."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Diamant] 
Ah. Right. Must be hard to read about past wars 
in the middle of a new one. But don't worry..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Diamant] 
You have my vow as the crown prince of Brodia 
that, when I'm king, there will be peace."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Framme] 
Wow. Really, really?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Framme] 
A vow from the crown prince of Brodia is good 
enough for me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Diamant] 
Heh heh, I mean it. Rest easy, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Framme] 
Ha! I will. But only after I've read some more of 
this not-so-boring book!"
