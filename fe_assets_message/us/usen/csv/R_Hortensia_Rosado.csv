[Rosado] 
This is too many Corrupted to take on! 
Hortensia, we have to retreat!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Hortensia] 
No, I've got this! I can...handle it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
Look out!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Rosado, no!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Rosado] 
Ah!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Rosado... I was trying to protect you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Hortensia] 
Let's get out of here─no one's dying today!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Rosado! Come back to me! Don't be dead..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Rosado] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Hortensia] 
You're awake! Are you all right? Do you 
recognize me?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Rosado] 
Yeah... Sure, sure. Just nodded off for a sec."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Hortensia] 
Nodded off?! I thought you were dead!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Hortensia] 
Wait, what's the paper fo─ Are you DRAWING?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Rosado] 
Hahaha! Picture-perfect, Hortensia!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Hortensia] 
WHAT?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Hortensia] 
You're not even hurt!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Rosado] 
Nope! But take a look─you really are beautiful 
this time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Hortensia] 
It's right when you woke up. I look so...relieved."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Hortensia] 
That is a pretty good one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Hortensia] 
You're right... I used to make faces like this 
more when we were in school."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Rosado] 
Usually when the history teacher called on 
someone else instead of you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Hortensia] 
Hey!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Rosado] 
So, can I keep this one?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Hortensia] 
Fine. But you can't show it to anyone."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Rosado] 
Of course I won't."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Hortensia] 
Thanks for looking out for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Hortensia] 
I feel like you're always saving me from 
something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Rosado] 
If you wanna pay me back, just show me the 
real you once in a while. That's all I want."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Hortensia] 
Hehe, deal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Hortensia] 
You're much more than just a retainer to me, 
you know. You're my friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Hortensia] 
And as long as we're friends, I don't think I'll 
have any trouble being myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Rosado] 2 

[Rosado] 
Yeah, she's just wrong. This expression is 
way better."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Hortensia] 
Hey! That's the portrait you drew of me 
staring at nothing!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Hortensia] 
I told you to throw it away. Why is it still here?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Rosado] 
I'm sorry...but also kinda not?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Rosado] 
I really like what I see in this picture."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Well I don't. And it's my face. Get rid of it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Rosado] 
If you really hate it that much... OK."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Hortensia] 
Why is this at all difficult?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Rosado] 
Because it's a picture of the real you. Not the 
fake smile you put on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Rosado] 
You used to be so expressive!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Rosado] 
Like back at the academy! Remember?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Hortensia] 
I can't, Rosado."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Hortensia] 
I can't dwell on the academy. I don't get to do 
that anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Hortensia] 
I'm a princess, and that means I keep smiling, 
all the time, forever."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Rosado] 
Well, that's a load of royal duty."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Heh. Yeah, but it's what we get. And that's why 
that picture has to get tossed. Understand?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Rosado] 
Yeah. Farewell then, honest Hortensia..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Rosado] 2 

[Rosado] 
Haha! Picture-perfect, Hortensia!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Huh? What did you say?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Rosado] 
Look! I drew your picture! I can draw real fast─ 
it's my not-so-hidden talent."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Rosado] 
See? It's practically a mirror. And look at how 
beautiful you are!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Seriously? I'm staring off into the distance. 
I look boring."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Hortensia] 
Here, do it again. I'll pose for it properly 
this time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Rosado] 
I like this one, though."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Are you joking? It's awful. The expression 
doesn't...express me at all!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Hortensia] 
Here, this is my good side. Draw me again."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Rosado] 
Nah. Your first expression's better."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Hortensia] 
This is an order from your princess."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Rosado] 
Fine, fine. Make the face again... Done. Is this 
what you wanted?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Hortensia] 
Perfect! Be sure to throw that other one away."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Hortensia] 
We can't let future generations think I was some 
boring girl always staring off at nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Rosado] 
There's nothing boring about you..."
