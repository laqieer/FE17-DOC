This is just like when I fought the soldiers my

I'll show her how strong I've become!"

[Alear] 
We retrieved the ring safely! But it doesn't seem 
to hold an Emblem? Strange..."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Vander] 
Is it but a normal ring?"
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alear] 
It seems so, but when I hold the ring, I feel 
a warmth stirring in my chest."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Marth] 
So it's as I suspected."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Vander] 
What is it that you have surmised?"
MID_ED1_#006,"[Marth] 
The ""Pact Ring."" It belongs to, and holds the 
power of, Divine Dragon Monarch Lumera."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Alear] 
What else do you know about this ""Pact 
Ring,"" Marth?"
MID_ED1_#008,"[Marth] 
Lumera once said that Divine Dragons will give 
a special ring to someone they truly trust."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Marth] 
The ring strengthens the bond between the two 
and brings them closer together."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Marth] 
It grants special powers to the Divine Dragon 
and anyone they make a pact with, of any sort."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Alear] 
So, Mother...once gave this ring to someone she 
trusted and had a special connection with?"
MID_ED1_#012,"[Marth] 
That's what I'd guess too. But she'd lost her 
friends and allies in the war."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Marth] 
So who she gave the ring to, or if she gave it at 
all...there's just no way to know."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Alear] 
Mother..."
MID_ED1_#015,"[Marth] 
But we know that, as long as she lived, the most 
important person to her was you."
MID_ED1_#016,"[Marth] 
You should inherit the ring. Give it to your most 
trusted ally."
MID_ED1_#017,"[Alear] 
I'll think long and hard before I decide who's 
worthy to wear it."
MID_ED1_#018,"[Vander] 
That we've arrived at this place, it must be the 
work of Queen Lumera."
MID_ED1_#019,"[Alear] 
It's a happy thought, Mother watching over me. 
But the fight ahead is my own. I must be strong."
MID_ED1_#020,"[Alear] 
Let's go. I'm reluctant to leave...but there is 
much work to do."

[Alear] 
Oh my! Are my eyes lying to me?"
MID_OP1_#002,"[Marth] 
This is quite a surprise. It looks just like the 
Lythos Castle Gardens."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
So I'm not the only one seeing it?"
MID_OP1_#004,"[Marth] 
It looks like the castle, but it feels like it too. 
The air, the smells─all of it."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Vander] 
Right you are. I've served in the castle for many 
years, yet this vision fooled me at first."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Alear] 
I know it isn't real, yet I still get a sense of 
nostalgia looking at it..."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Alear] 
My mother trained me in the castle garden. 
The flowers were in full bloom...like these."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Vander] 
I remember it well. Alas, after the attack, that 
garden has been left in ruins."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Alear] 
It has, hasn't it..."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Marth] 
Look! Over there! I can see something 
glimmering. Do you see it too?"
MID_OP1_#011,"[Alear] 
Is that an altar? And on it... There's a ring!"
MID_OP1_#012,"[Vander] 
I thought we'd gathered all the Emblem Rings... 
Can it be that there were more?"
MID_OP1_#013,"[Alear] 
Perhaps an Emblem we were unaware of? 
Let's go have a look!"
MID_OP1_#014,"[Marth] 
Wait. I feel a presence... There are enemies 
nearby."

Corrupted?! They must be here for the ring!"
MID_OP1_#018,"[Alear] 
We can't let them take it! That ring might 
belong to another Emblem!"
MID_OP1_#019,"[Vander] 
I fight beside you once more, Divine One!"
MID_OP1_#020,"[Marth] 
Hm. That ring... Could it be?"
