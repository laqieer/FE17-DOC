[Vander] 2 

[Vander] 
Shall I attend to your weapons and armor, 
Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
No need. I've got time, so I'll take care of 
it myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Vander] 
Understood. Then I shall turn my attention to 
other tasks, by your leave."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Thank you for being so diligent."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Vander] 
Of course, Divine One. It is nothing. Nothing 
at all..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
Is something troubling you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Vander] 
May I have but a moment of your time?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
You may. What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Vander] 
Some time back, Divine One, you spoke of how 
you and Queen Lumera are different people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Vander] 
Having served humbly beneath you both, I have 
observed quite a few similarities."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Vander] 
In fact, I observed some of your similarities 
just now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
How so?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Vander] 
You are thoughtful and kind to everyone─in 
turn you are well loved by all you meet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Vander] 
If there is any difference between you, I think it 
is only that you are still growing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Vander] 
You have a bright, limitless future ahead. It is 
my desire to support you in that future."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
Vander, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Vander] 
I hope that I have not offended you. I wanted 
only to speak from the heart."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
No, I'm happy you opened up to me like this. 
It's as you say, I've still got a lot to learn."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
If I grow enough, hopefully I'll become more 
like my mother─someone people can count on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Vander] 
I am certain that you can and you will, Divine 
One. That is why I am here, serving you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
As long as you're with me─guiding me─I can 
also feel certain that things will work out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alear] 
Please continue to lend me your strength. 
Someday, when I'm stronger, I'll lend you mine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Vander] 
Of course, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Vander] 2 

[Vander] 
Divine One, I have finished repairing and 
polishing your weapons."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Vander."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Vander] 
I have also prepared all of the materials you will 
require for the war council tomorrow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Vander] 
Please do take a moment to review them 
sometime today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry, but I can't do this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Vander] 
Do what, precisely?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
Vander, do you think I'm unreliable?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Vander] 
What? Goodness, no!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Vander] 
We are mortals, and you are the Divine One─ 
our magnificent leader, if you take my meaning."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Vander] 
For you to perform lowly tasks that are mine 
to execute is most gracious, but uncalled for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry, but I don't feel comfortable having a 
servant. That's not who I am."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Vander] 
Ah. Before I was your attendant, I was similarly 
engaged in caring for Queen Lumera."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Vander] 
Your mother, perfect in mind and beauty, never 
lodged a complaint regarding my services."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Vander] 
In time, Divine One, I hope that you will grow 
accustomed to my work as your caretaker."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
I respect my mother, and thank you for your 
service to her. But...I'm not my mother."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I'm my own person. I'm capable. I can take care 
of myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Vander] 
I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Vander] 
My apologies, Divine One. I have pushed myself 
on you. An old servant's habit, I suppose."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Vander] 
I will honor your request and take more care 
in considering your needs, moving forward."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Vander. And, please, let me know 
before you do anything on my behalf?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alear] 
There are many times I will need your help. 
But I'd like to ask for that help."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Vander] 2 

[Alear] 
Phew, I've hit my limit for training today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Vander] 
Excellent work, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Vander] 
I brought a hot towel for your face. I think you 
will find it most refreshing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Vander. That's very kind of you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Vander] 
I have also prepared a fresh change of clothes 
for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Vander] 
When you change, deposit your dirty clothes 
into the basket, and I will wash them for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
I appreciate your generosity, Vander, but I'd 
prefer to take care of my own laundry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
Certainly you have other tasks to keep 
you busy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Vander] 
My only obligation is to you, Divine One. Feel 
no hesitation in asking me for anything."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
But..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Vander] 
It has been my duty to wait on you since long 
before you awakened."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Vander] 
Were you to assume my duties for yourself, my 
position would cease to exist."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Vander] 
So please, leave these trivialities to me─where 
they belong─and trouble yourself no further."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
Again, I appreciate your willingness to help me, 
but I do feel a bit bad about all this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Vander] 
There is nothing in all of Elyos to feel bad 
about, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Vander] 
Now I must insist you change out of your damp 
clothes before you catch yourself a cold."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Vander] 2 

[Vander] 
Divine One. I must admit to you a 
grave confession."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Oh? Go on..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Vander] 
As I wish to continue serving you, I feel it is 
prudent to tell you everything."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Vander] 
When first I was dispatched to the Somniel to 
serve you, I was unhappy at the prospect."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
You were?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Vander] 
Indeed. Prior to serving you, all I wanted was to 
serve Queen Lumera until the very end."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Vander] 
Despite my many protestations, Queen Lumera 
insisted I watch over you in your slumber."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Vander] 
I felt I was cast aside─useless as her servant. 
I arrived at the Somniel under a dark cloud..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
I see... So what caused such a change of heart?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Vander] 
Initially, I was simply carrying out Queen 
Lumera's orders."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Vander] 
But now I serve you because I believe in who 
you are─your heart and your will, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
Vander..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Vander] 
It wasn't until Queen Lumera passed that I 
realized she knew her time was short."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Vander] 
That is why she appointed me as your caretaker 
and directed me to assist you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Vander] 
To be entrusted with Queen Lumera's child is 
the highest honor for any steward."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Vander] 
In my own foolishness, I failed to see it then. 
But I see it now. For this, I must apologize."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
There is nothing to apologize for. Thank you for 
speaking so honestly with me, Vander."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Vander] 
Divine One, would you grant me the honor to 
swear my allegiance to you once more?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Vander] 
Divine One, I hereby pledge to you my 
undying loyalty."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
Vander, I recognize you as my steadfast knight."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
To honor that, I would like to give you this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Vander] 
The Pact Ring? Such a precious thing cannot 
possibly be given to me!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Of course it can. I want you to have it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
This ring is handed down among Divine 
Dragons, representing a special bond with them."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Alear] 
So there is no one more fitting than you, who 
has served both me and my mother tirelessly."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Vander] 
To think...that I might one day be granted 
such an honor."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
Hah, I recall you saying something similar when 
I first awoke. You've been with me ever since."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Alear] 
Now I ask that you stand with me until the 
very end."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Vander] 
It is my honor! Divine One, I will follow you, 
even unto the ends of the world."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Vander] 
To be truly worthy of this ring, I will never again 
allow any harm to befall you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Vander] 
I, Vander, swear to protect you. I will be your 
sword and shield, even should it cost me my life."
