[Ivy] 
Zelkov, I have something for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 
A paintbrush? Is this for *me*?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
Yes. To thank you for the headache medicine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Ivy] 
I understand you're a painter. But if you have 
no need for it, feel free to get rid of it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Zelkov] 
On the contrary─I will take *exquisite* care 
of it. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Ivy] 
I'm...glad you like it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Zelkov] 
I..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Zelkov] 
Princess Ivy, I hope you know I *enjoy* my work."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Zelkov] 
In fact, when I have a task before me, it is my 
way to *immerse* myself in it entirely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Zelkov] 
In those times, and *only* those times, my mind 
is truly at peace."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Zelkov] 
So long as I am your retainer, so long as there 
is *work* to do...I have a purpose."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Zelkov] 
That is how deeply I appreciate working 
for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Ivy] 
I see. If that's true, then I'm happy to have you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Zelkov] 
These are indeed my *true* feelings. You know 
I am unwilling to lie or flatter."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Ivy] 
Yes, you've made that clear."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Zelkov] 
I hope you will never hesitate to delegate *any* 
task to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Zelkov] 
I would *die* for you, my liege, and gladly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Ivy] 
Gladly? Despite your lack of fond feelings 
toward me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Zelkov] 
My *feelings*...may have changed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Zelkov] 
I now think of you as an *acceptable* liege."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Ivy] 
I find you acceptable as well, Zelkov."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Zelkov] 
Hm, kind of you to say."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Ivy] 
However, dying for my sake is not a task to 
which I will assign you. Gladly or otherwise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Ivy] 
Consider yourself under strict orders to survive 
as you continue to serve me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Zelkov] 
You may rely on me, Princess Ivy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Zelkov] 
There is nothing quite so *isolating* as pain."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Zelkov] 
It cannot be explained. The only window to 
understanding it is *experience.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Zelkov] 
Does that mean we are destined to be 
*strangers* to one another?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Zelkov] 
Not at all. For we possess the gift of *wisdom,* 
by which we may intuit what we cannot see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Zelkov] 
I have distilled this wisdom to its essence. 
I have *corked* it within this tincture."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Zelkov] 
This vessel encapsulates the *light* which will 
dispel the dark fog of your isolation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Ivy] 
I'm sorry, what is happening? What is this?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Zelkov] 
Headache medicine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Ivy] 
You're saying you made this? For me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Yes. As your retainer, I have a *duty* to serve 
you by every available means."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Ivy] 
I... Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Zelkov] 
Your thanks are unnecessary. I am only *doing* 
my duty."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Ivy] 
Thank you for reaffirming exactly why 
I dislike you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Ivy] 
That said... I admit I appreciate your honesty."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Ivy] 
Many in your position would flatter or lie."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Ivy] 
You speak your mind. I respect that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Zelkov] 
I, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Ivy] 
Did you...have something more to say?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Zelkov] 
Apologies, Princess Ivy. The sentiment merely 
*surprised* me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Zelkov] 
I will take my leave and *attend* to my other 
duties. Rest well."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Zelkov] 

[Ivy] 
I will. Thank you, Zelkov."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Ivy] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
What is the meaning of this *sound,* 
Princess Ivy?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Ivy] 
Just a headache."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Zelkov] 
I hope you are not *overworking* yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Ivy] 
I'm fine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Ivy] 
And there is no need to pretend you care."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Ivy] 
I know you are not fond of me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Zelkov] 
Hm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Zelkov] 
Let me *make* this absolutely clear."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Zelkov] 
My concern for your *well-being* is genuine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Zelkov] 
It is, after all, my *responsibility.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Ivy] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Zelkov] 
Yet for some reason, it concerns you whether 
I have fond *feelings* toward you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Zelkov] 
So, allow me to state it *plainly.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Zelkov] 
I do not have fond *feelings* toward you, 
Princess Ivy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Zelkov] 
I see such things as *irrelevant.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Zelkov] 
Whatever my sentiments may be, what matters 
is that you have my *obedience.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Ivy] 
What a curious thing for my own retainer to say."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Ivy] 
But that's a relief. I don't like you either."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Zelkov] 
I will *obey* you regardless."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Ivy] 
So good to hear."
