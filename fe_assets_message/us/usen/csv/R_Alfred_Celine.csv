[Céline] 2 
[Alfred] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Céline] 
What are you doing there, Alfred? Digging 
another well? Or is this more training?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
Something like that. Trying to keep up my 
health, you know."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alfred] 
Yeah. If I train hard enough, then... 
I won't suffer like I used to..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Céline] 
...Alfred?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alfred] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Céline] 
What's wrong?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alfred] 
Don't worry, Céline... It's...just an attack. 
It'll pass soon..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Céline] 
An attack?! Is it your old illness?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alfred] 
I was doing so well... That part of my life was 
supposed to be long gone..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Céline] 
Wait here. I'll fetch someone at once."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alfred] 
No. Stop!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Céline] 
What? Why should I?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alfred] 
I don't want anyone to see me like this. Not our 
allies, the Emblems, or the Divine Dragon!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alfred] 
I can't let them see this...a weak prince, unfit to 
fight, who could collapse any day..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Céline] 
None of them would see you that way. They're 
far too gracious for that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alfred] 
But I would still know! And besides, I don't 
want them to worry about me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alfred] 
As far as they're concerned, I want to be the 
spirited prince who loves working out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alfred] 
Just let me rest for a while. I'll be fine. 
Please, Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Céline] 
Very well. But know that if your condition ever 
worsens, I will seek help."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alfred] 
Thanks."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alfred] 
Having a sister like you is true happiness, 
if you ask me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Céline] 
That's your idea of true happiness? Don't 
be absurd."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alfred] 
Well, what about you, then? What brings you 
true happiness?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Céline] 
Nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alfred] 
Really? You've got good friends, you got your 
health─none of that does it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Céline] 
I take joy in those things, to be sure. But I don't 
value happiness as a life goal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Céline] 
After all, what if I found it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Céline] 
Then my whole life afterward would be spent 
looking fondly back."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Alfred] 
Haha, really? Even if something better 
comes along?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Céline] 
The possibility that it never will is terrifying. 
I couldn't bear it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Céline] 
I've always yearned for happiness and saw only 
misery. Like the day I fled from the castle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Céline] 
If Firene had fallen or Mother died or you were 
lost to us...I wondered, ""How would I respond?"""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Céline] 
And now this? If things get worse, and you 
have to leave... What will I... How can I..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Alfred] 
Hey... I'm not gonna die, OK? I'll be fine if I 
stick with my training."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#037,"[Céline] 
You really do have the mind of a barbarian. 
If only you had the body to match."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#038,"[Alfred] 
Haha, I'll get there! That's why I work out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#039,"[Alfred] 
Oh, Céline, look! You see that four-leaf clover?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#040,"[Céline] 
Hmm? Where?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#041,"[Alfred] 
Right by your foot. There you go. A small joy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#042,"[Céline] 
A small joy... That takes me back. We often 
sought such things when we were younger."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#043,"[Céline] 
At that age, I was better at it than you. 
I wonder when you surpassed me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#044,"[Alfred] 
Talking to you makes me feel better. 
Chalk up another small joy for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#045,"[Céline] 
I'm not certain that counts, but I'm relieved to 
hear that the worst has passed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#046,"[Alfred] 
Let me make it up to you, Céline. I'll find lots 
of little joys and bring them to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#047,"[Alfred] 
I can't promise everything will be fine with me, 
but we can prop each other up...for Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#048,"[Céline] 
Yes, Alfred. I will support you in anything."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#049,"[Céline] 
Whatever else happens, we can make sure 
we return to Firene. Together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Céline] 2 

[Céline] 
Do you know what you are, Alfred? 
A barbarian in prince's clothing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
Huh! What a nice thing to say. Thanks, Céline!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Céline] 
How did that strike you as a compliment?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alfred] 
You meant that I've got muscles all over like 
a barbarian, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alfred] 
That's real praise, even if you're just saying it 
'cause I'm your brother."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Céline] 
That is not at all how I meant it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alfred] 
Hey, hey... It's OK, Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alfred] 
If that wasn't the idea, then what did you 
mean by it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Céline] 
Your first impulse on hearing we were low on 
water was to dig a well!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alfred] 
Oh, right! Some mix-up, huh? Boy, was my 
face red!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Céline] 
Would that it were the only example."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Céline] 
What about the time you heard some soldiers 
wishing they could cleanse themselves?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Céline] 
You immediately leapt to dig them a hot spring!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alfred] 
Oh. Do we not like hot springs?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Céline] 
That isn't my point. Why is your first instinct 
always to go digging?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alfred] 
'Cause it's good training!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Céline] 
Save your breath!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Céline] 
It's instincts like that that mark you as barbaric."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Céline] 
Which would be fine for most men, but you are 
a prince. Try to act the part."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alfred] 
All right, Céline. I get your point."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alfred] 
From now on, I'm gonna train even harder. 
No more skip days!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alfred] 
Pretty soon, I'll be so beefy that everyone can 
tell right off what a barbarian I am."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alfred] 
No...more...confusion!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Céline] 
Ugh! Once again, you have completely missed 
the point."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Céline] 2 
[Alfred] 
Hup! Eh... Hup! Eh... Hup! Eh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Céline] 
Good morning, Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alfred] 
Morning, Céline!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Céline] 
Training hard again, I see. Though, normally I 
don't find you using a shovel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Céline] 
That's a deep hole you've dug too. Won't this 
be hazardous for the others?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alfred] 
Heh heh! Oh, Céline, this isn't training."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alfred] 
And if anything, I need to dig deeper!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alfred] 
Hup! Eh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Céline] 
What in the world is the purpose of this?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alfred] 
I overheard the kitchen staff this morning 
complaining that there wasn't enough water."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alfred] 
So I'm digging a well for them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Céline] 
Pardon?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Céline] 
Alfred. If the water supply is low, there's a river 
nearby we can fetch more from."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Céline] 
What possessed you to decide that the solution 
to the problem was to dig a well?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alfred] 
Hey, you're right. That's using your noggin!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alfred] 
I'd better find a jug and leg it to the river. 
Thanks for the tip, Céline!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Céline] 
You haven't changed one bit, it seems."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Céline] 
Better that you should dress in pelts and furs to 
warn people of your barbaric mindset!"
