[Bunet] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
I am curious, Bunet. What motivates you to 
learn so many new foods?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
I wish to become a poet of the plate."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
To me, that means expressing my vision with 
the broadest possible vocabulary of flavors."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Bunet] 
I thought I was well on my way to fluency in all 
existing culinary languages, but alas..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Bunet] 
I didn't even know...about ohagi."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
We are very much alike, it seems."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Bunet] 
What? How do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
I left my home in search of knowledge about 
the world at large."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
Seeking out strong opponents to fight has 
been my way to experience new horizons."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
At Elusia Castle, I had my first encounter with 
true defeat. And that is when I realized..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
The ones I fought there were very strong. But 
so many other strong ones await me still."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Bunet] 
Hm. Our situations do seem similar."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Bunet] 
You wish to become the world's best fighter, 
just as I wish to become the world's best chef."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
I have been fortunate to become retainer to 
Princess Ivy. This position is teaching me much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
I am now able to see that it is not necessary 
for me to meet every strong opponent there is."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
I cannot hope to know everything. What I can do 
is focus on mastering my own skill."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Bunet] 
How wise. I wonder if I will ever be able to 
adopt your accepting attitude."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Kagetsu] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
Bunet, I have decided. I will contribute to 
your path toward mastery."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
If you wish it, I will tell you all that I know 
of cuisine in my culture."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
Pale Sands lives in isolation, so there may be 
no other way for you to study it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Bunet] 
That sounds wonderful, but...you said you were 
busy with your retainer duties."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Kagetsu] 
But you and I are friends. And I can always 
make time for friendship!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Bunet] 
Thank you, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Bunet] 
I will pay you back in onigiri."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Bunet] 
The proper kind this time. Made with salted fish 
and seaweed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes, but be sure to include ones with dates 
as well. They were delicious too!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Bunet] 
Hahaha, as you wish. Prepare to have your 
mouth water."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Bunet] 
I am looking forward to learning more about 
your culture."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Bunet] 
Kagetsu! It is time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
What for?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Bunet] 
Did you forget?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Bunet] 
Since we last spoke, I have been absorbed in 
the art of making onigiri."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Bunet] 
I experimented with ingredients, rice-density 
levels... For days, I thought of nothing else."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Bunet] 
Finally, after all that toil, I made this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
Oooh... It looks very good."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
But more important than how it looks is what it 
contains. Tell me the ingredients inside!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Bunet] 
I used dates, harvested fresh from a date palm. 
Something of a Solmic specialty."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
Date palm? That is eccentric. I do not know 
this ingredient."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Bunet] 
Give it a try."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
I will indeed!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
Hm. Hm. Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
Sweetness is unexpected for onigiri... But not 
unwelcome! The rice takes well to it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Bunet] 
Doesn't it? I went through much trial and error 
before landing on dates."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes, it is delicious! Very good. However..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
It is flavored more like ohagi."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Bunet] 
Like what?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Bunet] 
Are you saying that something like this 
already exists?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes! Ohagi is when sweet rice is rolled up and 
covered with red bean paste."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Bunet] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Bunet] 
So, in short...this is not an onigiri."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Kagetsu] 
No, no! The shape is very accurate to onigiri!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Bunet] 
But it tastes like an ohagi."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Bunet] 
I appreciate your kind words, but I will not 
settle for missing the mark."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Bunet] 
My culinary knowledge is lacking. Who knows 
how many dishes have escaped my notice?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Bunet] 
Excuse me. I must go study."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Kagetsu] 
Your onigiri was delicious, and yet you remain 
so eager to learn more..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Ah...hunger has struck. Perfect time for onigiri."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Bunet] 
Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
Oh! Bunet! How did you appear so suddenly?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Bunet] 
Those little food triangles. Onigiri, you 
called them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Bunet] 
I've never seen one before. What are they 
made of?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
Try one for yourself. Have mine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Bunet] 
Are you sure? Well, all right, then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Bunet] 
Mmm... It's delicious!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Bunet] 
A ball of rice, lightly salted and wrapped in 
seaweed. And, and...um...grilled fish, yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes! Salted salmon!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Bunet] 
I see. By all appearances, the simplest of foods, 
yet it contains hidden depths of flavor."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Bunet] 
Please, teach me how to make this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
It would be my pleasure. However, I have 
obligations to Princess Ivy as her retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
If I set aside my duty to teach you onigiri, she 
will be displeased."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Bunet] 
Ah. Disappointing, but I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Bunet] 
In that case, I will master the art of making 
onigiri on my own."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
I admire your passion! Tell me when you are 
done, and I will provide your taste test."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Bunet] 
Naturally. I will rely on you to judge whether 
I am capturing the food's essence."
