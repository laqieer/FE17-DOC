I must face him. Anything less would bring 
dishonor to Brodia."

Father, he's baiting you. This may be a trap of 
some kind. Go back inside."

he springs."
MID_ED2_#016,"[Diamant]

here? Stop trying to protect me."

..."
MID_ED2_#019,"[Morion] 
Son, this has been happening a lot lately. 
What's it all about?"
MID_ED2_#020,"Are you worried Brodia might lose this war? 
Or lose...its king?"
MID_ED2_#021,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_ED2_#022,"We're not ready for any of this. Brodia, to lose 
its king. Or me, my father."
MID_ED2_#023,"[Alcryst] 
Diamant?"
MID_ED2_#024,"[Diamant] 
From a young age, I was told I would lead 
Brodia after you died."
MID_ED2_#025,"Imagine...a boy forced to anticipate his father's 
death. To think of that empty throne."
MID_ED2_#026,"The Fell Dragon has returned. War is here. 
The future is uncertain."
MID_ED2_#027,And I'm not ready.
MID_ED2_#028,"[Morion] 
It's all right, Diamant. If I die, I die. Brodia will 
live on."
MID_ED2_#029,"[Diamant] 
But, Father!"
MID_ED2_#030,"[Morion] 
What, you don't believe me? After I'm gone, 
I know you will lead with a steady hand."
MID_ED2_#031,"Though I'm offended you expect that day to 
come so soon."
MID_ED2_#032,"You think I'm going to lose, huh? You think I'm 
weak? That I need your protection?"
MID_ED2_#033,"Oh, the hubris of youth."
MID_ED2_#034,"[Diamant] 
That's not what I meant."
MID_ED2_#035,"[Morion] 
King Hyacinth awaits me on the field of war, his 
army at the ready. If Brodia hides, then what?"
MID_ED2_#036,"After years locked in battle with Elusia, will we 
reveal ourselves as cowards?"
MID_ED2_#037,"Listen to me, Diamant. I will fight bravely for 
Brodia. I do not fear death."
MID_ED2_#038,"Being known as a king who runs from battle... 
That scares me far more."

What do you think about all this, Alcryst?"
MID_ED2_#041,"[Alcryst]

If I die, and Diamant alongside me, you will take 
the throne."

MID_ED2_#044,"[Diamant] 
Father, don't say that."
MID_ED2_#045,"[Alcryst]

the bitter end."

Alcryst..."
MID_ED2_#048,"[Morion] 
Haha! That's my boy! Diamant, you could learn 
a thing or two from your brother."
MID_ED2_#049,Fear has no place in my kingdom.
MID_ED2_#050,"If we step into fear, then we step out of Brodia."
MID_ED2_#051,"[Diamant]

MID_ED2_#052,"[Morion] 
Now then, to the border!"
MID_ED2_#053,"[Diamant] 
It seems I can't dissuade you from this path. 
All I can do is walk it with you."
MID_ED2_#054,"Come on, everyone. Let's show Elusia why 
we're called the kingdom of might."
MID_ED2_#055,"[Morion] 
Haha! That's it! This won't be the last time 
I see the castle."
MID_ED2_#056,"And when I'm back, a tournament with our 
strongest warriors! That means you, Divine One!"
MID_ED2_#057,"[Alear] 
Me?"
MID_ED2_#058,"[Morion] 
Yes! I want to see you transform into a mighty 
dragon. Whoosh! Roar!"

Oh... OK."
MID_ED2_#060,"[Morion] 
What's the matter?"
MID_ED2_#061,"[Alear] 
Ah, nothing. You're right. I could turn into 
a dragon."
MID_ED2_#062,"[Morion] 
Haha! I'm looking forward to that!"
MID_ED2_#063,"[Diamant] 
I'd like to spar with you, too, Divine One. After 
Father gets his chance."
MID_ED2_#064,"But that's for later. Now we should prepare 
for our journey to the border."

Indeed."

MID_OP3_#037,"[Alfred] 
You're seeing Morion─friend and family man. 
He's known to be a bighearted guy."
MID_OP3_#038,"But in battle, the demon comes out. He's not 
someone you want as your enemy."
