MID_RELIANCE_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
I baked cookies for us, Boucheron! With 
thunder, of course, as always. Now, eat up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Oooh, I can't wait. Hey, there's raisins in 
these! Yum."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
Read any further in that book yet?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Boucheron] 
I finished it, actually."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Lindon] 
Have you, now? Well then, tell me everything."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Boucheron] 
Sure... After the wedding, L's life was simple 
but happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Boucheron] 
The couple went through hard times, but they 
did it together, and saw their children grow up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Boucheron] 
But just when the kids were all grown and they 
could enjoy their sunset years...L's wife passed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Boucheron] 
L never got to feed his wife the last pastry he 
baked for her...with a bolt of thunder."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Lindon] 
There, there, Boucheron... I find myself crying 
as well today."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Boucheron] 
I realized when I got to that part...this story is 
about you, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lindon] 
Indeed it is. ""L,"" of course, is my first initial."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Boucheron] 
But why is there a book about you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lindon] 
I thought─before I join my wife in the beyond─ 
I'd record my life for posterity."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Lindon] 
But I was careless and lost the manuscript."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Boucheron] 
So you wrote this book? Well, now I'm sorry 
I read it without permission."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Lindon] 
Nonsense. I'm genuinely glad that you picked it 
up and read the whole tale."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Boucheron] 
It was wonderfully written, for what it's worth."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lindon] 
Why don't we spend more time together? You 
can get to know me until my last pages."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Boucheron] 
It would be my pleasure."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Lindon] 
Splendid! I'm in such a good mood that I think 
I might bake another batch of sweets!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lindon] 
But lightning-baking takes time, so why don't 
you tell me your story?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Boucheron] 
Let's see, where to start? I guess with the day 
my parents met..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
So, how's that book of yours coming along?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Lindon] 
Oh, but where are my manners? I meant to 
give you a treat first."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Boucheron] 
These are some tasty-looking pastries."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lindon] 
I baked them myself. There's apple filling inside."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Boucheron] 
You bake, Sir Lindon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Lindon] 
Oh, yes. Nothing bakes a pastry like a good 
jolt of thunder magic. Go on, try one."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Boucheron] 
Oh, don't mind if I do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Boucheron] 
Wow! I had no idea a little zap of lightning 
could make such a tasty treat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lindon] 
Good, aren't they? Now, back to the subject 
of your book."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Boucheron] 
Oh yeah. Last time, the prince L worked for 
didn't inherit the throne, so he left the castle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Boucheron] 
Then, L meets another royal soldier and finds 
comfort with her."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Boucheron] 
They get married and begin an ordinary, but 
happy, life together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Boucheron] 
That's as far as I've got for now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Lindon] 
Fascinating. This story has its hooks in me. 
I was a royal soldier once myself, you know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lindon] 
I notice you don't seem to be crying 
today, though."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Boucheron] 
It's actually pretty tough to hold it in. L's wife 
goes through so much for his sake..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Boucheron] 
But I'm embarrassed to be seen crying all the 
time, so I'm doing my best to keep it together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Lindon] 
Heh, don't hold back on my account!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Lindon] 
There's nothing to be embarrassed about. 
Cry as hard as you like. Let it all out!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Boucheron] 
Are...are you sure? Well...if you say so..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Boucheron] 
UWAAAAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Lindon] 
Oh my, your nose is running! Here, something 
to wipe it with."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Boucheron] 
Thanks again..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Lindon] 
My, my. What happened here to bring you to 
such a state?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Oh... I, um, found a book lying around."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Boucheron] 
But when I started reading it, it was so moving 
that I...I couldn't hold back the waterworks."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lindon] 
A tragedy, is it? Tell me more."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Boucheron] 
It's a story of a great sage known only as ""L."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lindon] 
Oh? Tell me more about this ""L"" fellow."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Boucheron] 
It starts off with L as a young boy who's at the 
top of his class at an academy in Elusia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Boucheron] 
Then, it follows him as he becomes a royal 
soldier─even ending up as the prince's retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Lindon] 
Mm-hmm. I'm with you so far."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Boucheron] 
The prince was supposed to ascend the throne, 
but it ended up being somebody else instead."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Boucheron] 
The prince left the castle in frustration. L just 
stands there stunned as he goes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Boucheron] 
That was too sad to take, so I don't know what 
happens next."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lindon] 
Oh, you poor thing. Here, dry your eyes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Thank you, sir."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Boucheron] 
You know, lots of books make me cry, but this 
one hit me really hard for some reason."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Boucheron] 
Thinking about the prince's bitterness and the 
way L felt to see him go...it's just too tragic."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Lindon] 
You've got me invested now. If you keep 
reading, do tell me how it turns out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Boucheron] 
Sure thing, sir."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Lindon] 
And you can keep the handkerchief."
