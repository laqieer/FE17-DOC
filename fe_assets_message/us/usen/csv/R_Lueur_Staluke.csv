[Alear] 
Alcryst! There's another wolf!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
It's heading toward you! Look out!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Yes. I see it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Why are you standing still?! We need to get 
to safety!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alcryst] 
It's OK, Divine One. I can handle this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alcryst] 
Smell that, boy? I brought some jerky with me. 
Come on, eat up..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
I don't believe it. Alcryst just tamed that wolf!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alcryst] 
This is the same wolf that almost attacked you 
before, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alcryst] 
You'd better head back up the mountain now. 
Stay safe out there, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
When did you two become friends?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alcryst] 
I've been coming here to practice my archery. 
He keeps showing up to watch."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alcryst] 
We were pretty tense around each other at first, 
but then I remembered your advice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
Which advice was that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alcryst] 
You said I should handle things my own way. 
I didn't want to attack the wolf, so I relaxed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alcryst] 
He must have sensed that because he relaxed 
in kind. Now it's like we're friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
Alcryst! That's amazing!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alcryst] 
Thank you. It was all because of your guidance."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alcryst] 
Oh! What am I doing?! I'm thanking the Divine 
Dragon in such an informal manner! I should─"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
Please, Alcryst, no more throwing yourself 
at my feet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
Don't be upset. Your apologies are impressive, 
but you could stand to, well, stand more often."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alear] 
If you really want to thank me, that wolf did 
look awfully friendly toward you..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alear] 
Could you help me win him over?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alcryst] 
That should be easy. Just bring some jerky next 
time. Then we can all play together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alear] 
I'll do just that! Can't wait. Thank you, Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Alcryst] 2 

[Alear] 
Alcryst? Do you have a moment?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
I do, Divine One. What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
Why are you standing like that? Are you OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alcryst] 
I'm preparing to bow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
And...why are you doing that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alcryst] 
I want to be ready in case I need to apologize 
for something."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
Oh, for the love of─ There's no need for that! 
I just wanted to discuss that wolf incident."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alcryst] 
Oh? What about it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
I need you to understand something about me 
and about you. I'm not higher. You're not lower."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
We share the same footing. Try not to think or 
act otherwise, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alcryst] 
I wish I could follow that order, but...I just don't 
believe it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alear] 
Hey, come on... Why is it so hard for you to 
accept that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alcryst] 
I'm very sorry to disappoint you, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
I guess it can't be helped. I worry, but you do 
get results. Keep handling things your own way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alcryst] 
My own way? Are you sure?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alcryst] 
I'm aware that I often bring the mood down 
around others, and I struggle with compliments."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alcryst] 
I'm nowhere near as confident as my brother, 
so I'm sure my hesitation frustrates people."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alcryst] 
Despite all of that...you really think it's OK for 
me to keep handling things...my own way?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
I do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alear] 
But I hope that, someday, you'll take what I've 
been saying to heart."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alcryst] 
Very well. Thank you for your advice, 
Divine One..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Alcryst] 
Divine One, watch out! There's a wolf!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
What? Where?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Mr. Wolf! Please go away! Leave the Divine 
Dragon alone─I beg you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Ugh... It isn't listening to me... No choice. 
I'll have to get serious."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
That pose! Is he about to...bow in apology like 
the incident at the border?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alcryst] 
Mr. Wolf! I'm so, so sorry!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alcryst] 
I'm sure that my apologies will enrage you 
further─to the point you might devour me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alcryst] 
And if I wind up in your stomach, my allies may 
waste days looking for me, but I must persist!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alcryst] 
Please, though I have no right to make this 
request, I ask you to go home! I'm begging you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
The wolf is actually turning away... Incredible."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alcryst] 
There it goes..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alcryst] 
Thank goodness you're all right, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Alcryst. I'm glad you're OK too. 
That was a risky move..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alcryst] 
Think nothing of it. Your life is worth far more 
than mine, so I just did what needed to be done."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alear] 
Uh, no. My life, your life, everyone's lives... 
None of us are above anyone else."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Ah. You're right, Divine One... Looks like I've 
fallen short yet again."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alcryst] 
The Divine Dragon's radiance should lighten my 
mood, but I've managed to darken it instead..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alcryst] 
I sincerely apologize─I should leave."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alear] 
What? Alcryst! Wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alear] 
Wow. He's so fast..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Alcryst] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Uh, excuse me...Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Alcryst? What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Uh... Well, you see..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
You stopped yourself from bowing! Very nice 
recovery, Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alcryst] 
Yes. I must try to stand tall."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alcryst] 
Please, Divine One, have a look at this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
Oh! What a beautiful gemstone! It has such a 
mysterious color."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alcryst] 
It's a stone of Brodian origin. The coloring is 
quite rare, with red and blue mixed together..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alcryst] 
My father gave it to me when I was born. 
He liked how it matched my features."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
Ah, I see! This is a match for your blue hair and 
red eyes, isn't it? This gem suits you perfectly."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alcryst] 
B-but...your features are even more of a match, 
Divine One. The color distribution differs, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alcryst] 
It reminds me of you. I see someone I treasure 
who encouraged me to do things my own way."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
Wow. Someone you treasure, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alcryst] 
My father told me to choose an important 
person to give this to someday. So..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alcryst] 
Divine One... Please accept this as a token of... 
well, a token of my feelings toward you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Alcryst. I gladly accept your token."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
Now it's my turn. I'd like to give you this ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alcryst] 
This is the Pact Ring..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
It is. And now it's yours."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
Prince Alcryst... I, the Divine Dragon, grant you 
this, a symbol of our special bond."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
Let's share our lives as fellow soldiers...and 
partners in peace."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alcryst] 
C-coo..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry, did you just...coo?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Alcryst] 
Cool! Astoundingly cool! Impossibly cool! 
I can't believe this!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alcryst] 
I thought I stuck the landing for sure, but then 
you outshined me with an even grander gesture!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alcryst] 
And I don't even mind! This makes me so 
happy. Th-thank you, Divine One..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Alear] 
Oh, Alcryst, please don't cry!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Alcryst] 
I won't. I promise. I'll do my best to stand tall 
for you─and for myself."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Alcryst] 
Or, uh...taller than before, at least."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Alear] 
I suppose that's a start."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033,"[Alcryst] 
And I will get stronger! Despite how I seem, 
I am a prince of Brodia..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034,"[Alcryst] 
As a son of the kingdom of warriors, I will 
become someone you can rely on..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035,"[Alcryst] 
And I pledge to always protect you, 
Divine Dragon ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#036,"[Alear] 
Thoughtful as ever, Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#037,"[Alcryst] 
I can say all of this with the utmost confidence. 
In fact, I swear it upon this ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#038,"[Alear] 
I believe you, Alcryst. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#039,"[Alcryst] 
I will stand beside you proudly and be the best 
prince I can be, to the very end."
