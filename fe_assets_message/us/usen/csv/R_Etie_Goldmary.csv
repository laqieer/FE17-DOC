[Goldmary] 
Hello, Etie. Thanks for meeting with me. 
I was hoping we could talk."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Etie] 
I don't know why you called me here, but it 
had better be good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
This may sound a little peculiar, but would you 
mind giving me your hands?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Etie] 
What for?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Goldmary] 
I said some unfair things to you. Perhaps if I can 
feel your strength, I will learn to appreciate it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Goldmary] 
So, if you don't mind, I'd like to see how your 
hands feel. I'll put out the light so you can relax."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Etie] 
Uhh... Sure, I guess."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Goldmary] 
You really are strong. I can tell by the calluses 
how devoted you are to honing that strength."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Etie] 
Well...yeah."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Goldmary] 
Seeing how your dedication shapes who you are 
has helped me understand. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Goldmary] 
Here─take my hands, if you'd like. Maybe 
you'll understand who I am a little better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Etie] 
Does that work?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Goldmary] 
Only one way to find out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Etie] 
Whoa! Is your skin seriously this smooth?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Goldmary] 
Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Etie] 
I've never felt anything like this. You must put 
in some real effort to get it that way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry for asking this of you so suddenly. 
I know it's an odd way to get to know someone."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Etie] 
Hehe, a little. But I learned more about you 
than I thought."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Etie] 
You showed me there's more to life than being 
ready for war. I have to be ready for peace too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Goldmary] 
You see?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Goldmary] 
Perhaps we can learn from one another after all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Goldmary] 
I'd be happy to give you advice on elegance 
in exchange for tips on my exercise routine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Etie] 
Sure! I love coaching people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Etie] 
Between you and me, a big part of this is 
protein powder. I'll set some aside for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Goldmary] 
That sounds wonderful. If you'd like a lotion 
for your hands, I know several good ones."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Etie] 
Haha, look at us. It didn't take much for us to 
start getting along, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Etie] 
Maybe I should actually thank you for swiping 
that last baked potato."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Goldmary] 
No need to thank me for that. I was stealing, 
after all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Goldmary] 
I'm looking forward to learning from you, Etie. 
I hope you feel the same."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Etie] 1

[Etie] 
Hey, you Elusian weirdo. We gotta talk."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, I must have misheard you. Who are 
we talking about?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Etie] 
You heard me just fine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Etie] 
What possessed you to spend three hours 
before battle polishing silverware?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Goldmary] 
I don't see how that's any of your business."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Goldmary] 
But since we're asking questions, indulge me. 
What's the point of your excessive exercise?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Etie] 
What kind of question is that?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Etie] 
We're at war! Silverware doesn't keep you alive 
in battle. Muscle does."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, what?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Etie] 
Do you think your perfectly folded clothes are 
going to help you put a dent in the Corrupted?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Goldmary] 
Excuse me, what? What?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Etie] 
Quit it with the ""whats""!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Goldmary] 
Are you actually implying that I'm not in 
condition to survive a battle?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Goldmary] 
If that's what you think, I'm going to have to 
ask you to get out of my face."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Etie] 
What did you say?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Goldmary] 
You are looking at the very picture of elegance 
and grace. My condition defines pristine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if all your pointless sweating has 
drained away your aesthetic taste."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Etie] 
Ugh! What's wrong with you?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Goldmary] 
I was about to ask you the same thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Etie] 
Another delicious-looking spread for dinner."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Etie] 
Ooo, and they've got baked potatoes tonight. 
Lucky for me there's still one left."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Etie] 
Gotta get my starches in, after all!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Etie] 
Feels like everything's going my way."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Oh! I'm going to step in here. Excuse me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Etie] 
Did you just... That baked potato was mine!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Goldmary] 
Then you should have taken it instead of 
staring at it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Etie] 
Ugh! This is just the kind of thing I'd expect 
an Elusian to do."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Goldmary] 
Only when there are Firenese in the way."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Etie] 
I don't think you want to push this with me, 
lady. Hand over the baked potato."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Goldmary] 
Respectfully, I decline."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Etie] 
You ""decline""? That's a fine thing to say for 
a potato thief!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Goldmary] 
I can't steal what wasn't yours to begin with. 
Any authority figure would agree."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Etie] 
That's it. No more talk. Gimme that potato!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Goldmary] 
Mmm... No."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Etie] 
You can't just eat it!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Goldmary] 
Delicious. Mm."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Goldmary] 
Sorry, I got distracted for a moment there. 
What were you saying?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Etie] 
Urgh! Have it your way! But don't think this 
is over─you're gonna pay!"
