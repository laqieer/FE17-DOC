So this was the fates' intention after all. 
Please... Protect Emblem Corrin..."

[Alear] 
All right. We're safe."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Timerra] 
Hang on. Someone's at the entrance."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alear] 
Don't tell me. More of the Corrupted?"
MID_ED1_#004,"[Veyle] 1 

[Veyle] 
Is everyone OK? I saw all those monsters 
coming in and got worried."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alear] 
Veyle?!"
MID_ED1_#006,"[Veyle] 
Oh my! We meet again, . Did you 
defeat the monsters?"
MID_ED1_#007,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_ED1_#008,"Yes, we did. Every last one."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Veyle] 
I'm glad. How have you been?"
MID_ED1_#010,"I was surprised to see you out in that blizzard. 
I hope you found the cathedral."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Alear] 
Whatever game you're playing, stop it."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Veyle] 
Huh? Are you mad about something?"
MID_ED1_#013,"[Alear] 
Don't act like you forgot. I can see through 
your lies now."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Veyle] 
Lies? What do you mean? I promise you, 
, I'm not─"
MID_ED1_#015,"[Alfred] 3 
[Alfred] 
Not a step closer! You stay where you are, 
Fell Princess."

Just looking at you, I feel again the shame of 
losing Father..."
MID_ED1_#018,"[Alfred] 
[Ivy] 3 

[Ivy] 
You took my country from me─my father. 
What more do you want?"
MID_ED1_#019,"[Alear] 
The people you killed...they had families."
MID_ED1_#020,"But you don't care, do you? All that pain... 
You don't even give it a second thought."
MID_ED1_#021,"[Veyle] 
Wait a moment. I... I killed people? Who?"
MID_ED1_#022,"[Alear] 
Drop the act! You know what you did! How dare 
you show your face here."
MID_ED1_#023,You murdered my mother and stole the rings.
MID_ED1_#024,"[Veyle] 
I didn't. I didn't. Please believe me..."
MID_ED1_#025,"[Alear] 
Believe you? Like I believed we were friends? 
I won't make that mistake again."

[Alfred] 
We've got to do something!"
MID_ED1_#028,"[Alear] 
Let her go. It's probably a trap."
MID_ED1_#029,"[Alfred] 
You're right."

[Timerra] 
Divine One, are you all right?"
MID_ED1_#031,"[Alear] 
I'm fine. But the next time I see Veyle, I swear..."
MID_ED2_#001,"[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
..."
MID_ED2_#002,I killed people? Stole rings?
MID_ED2_#003,Why would I do that? I don't understand!
MID_ED2_#004,"[Griss] 1 
[Griss] 
Lady Veyle! I finally caught up with you."
MID_ED2_#005,"[Veyle] 
Oh, Griss. It's you."
MID_ED2_#006,"[Griss] 
You're a hard girl to find. Why'd you disappear? 
Had me all freaked out."
MID_ED2_#007,"[Veyle] 
Papa told you to drag me back home, right?"
MID_ED2_#008,"[Griss] 
Told me to... Huh?"
MID_ED2_#009,"Oh, I see what's going on here. You're the 
other one."
MID_ED2_#010,"[Veyle] 
I'm not going back, no matter what you say. 
Papa will just make me do something cruel."
MID_ED2_#011,"When he awoke, I thought we could finally 
spend time together. But no."
MID_ED2_#012,"Always telling me to kill the Divine Dragon or 
attack so-and-so's castle. Well, I don't want to!"
MID_ED2_#013,"I'm not an evil person. Despite what all those 
people said."
MID_ED2_#014,"Even the Divine Dragon was angry with me. 
And I thought we were friends..."
MID_ED2_#015,"[Griss] 
The Divine Dragon said you were friends? 
Wait─you met the Divine Dragon?!"
MID_ED2_#016,"[Veyle] 
Mm-hmm."
MID_ED2_#017,"[Griss] 
Oh, that's...complicated."
MID_ED2_#018,"Look, whatever those people told you, it's not 
true. They were imagining things."
MID_ED2_#019,"[Veyle] 
You think so?"
MID_ED2_#020,"[Griss] 
Of course. How could you have done 
something bad and then forgotten it?"
MID_ED2_#021,"[Veyle] 
Right... Right! I couldn't have!"
MID_ED2_#022,"If only I'd said that before, maybe there 
wouldn't be this awful misunderstanding."
MID_ED2_#023,"[Griss] 
You wanna try and speak with 'em again? 
Set things straight?"
MID_ED2_#024,"[Veyle] 
I do, but... Weren't you going to bring me back?"
MID_ED2_#025,"[Griss] 
If this is what you want, I'll help out. Nothing if 
not loyal, that's me."
MID_ED2_#026,"[Veyle] 
All right... Thank you, Griss. It seems 
I misjudged you."
MID_ED2_#027,"[Griss] 
It's settled, then. Let's head to Firene."
MID_ED2_#028,"[Veyle] 
Firene? Why there?"
MID_ED2_#029,"[Griss] 
'Cause that's where the Divine Dragon is going."
MID_ED2_#030,"[Veyle] 
How do you know that?"
MID_ED2_#031,"[Griss] 
Come on, we're on a schedule here! Gotta head 
for the port and set sail."
MID_ED2_#032,Do you wanna patch things up or don't you?
MID_ED2_#033,"[Veyle] 
I do. I do! You're right─no time to waste!"

A talking ring, hm?"

Yup. My ancestors designed it that way. 
Didn't want people to go poking around."

ghosts wander the ruins."
