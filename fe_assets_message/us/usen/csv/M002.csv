I'd like for you to have this, ."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Alear]

Yes─an ancient blade that can be wielded only 
by Divine Dragons."

yours. Consider it a prize for your victory today."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Alear]

Is this another Emblem Ring?"
MID_ED1_#015,"[Lumera] 
No, it is purely ornamental. You see, before 
your slumber, I made you a promise."
MID_ED1_#016,"[Alear] 
What was it?"
MID_ED1_#017,"[Lumera] 
I said I'd give you a birthday present that suited 
you perfectly."
MID_ED1_#018,"I was working on it in private, but I was unable 
to finish it in time..."
MID_ED1_#019,"That birthday has long since passed, but I 
would quite like to give you this gift now."

I'm sorry... I can't accept."
MID_ED1_#021,"[Lumera] 
Why not?"
MID_ED1_#022,"[Alear] 
That ring fulfills a promise you made me, right? 
But I don't remember that promise."
MID_ED1_#023,"It'd feel wrong accepting it─like I was taking a 
present meant for someone else."
MID_ED1_#024,"Please offer me this gift again once I've 
remembered everything."

Everything, you say."
MID_ED1_#026,...

recollections, ?"

It didn't. I'm sorry."
MID_ED1_#029,"[Lumera] 
You need not apologize. It doesn't matter what 
you can remember right now..."
MID_ED1_#030,"I only hope that one day, you will think of me 
as your mother."

MID_ED1_#033,"[Lumera]

you again."

Oh, no. It's all right."

Haha, I don't mean to put you on the spot. 
Perhaps we should call it a day, hm?"

Be cautious, Divine One. Some of these enemies 
are carrying long-range weapons."

from afar."

The Corrupted?"
MID_OP1_#018,"[Lumera] 
Those enemies you were fighting out on 
the grasslands."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Alear] 
Oh, I didn't like those things one bit. Just the 
sight of them made my blood run cold."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Lumera] 
Understandably so. The Corrupted are corpses 
revived by an evil power."
MID_OP1_#021,"The Fell Dragon used them as his soldiers in 
the war."
MID_OP1_#022,"Before the start of that bitter conflict, Elyos had 
known peace for eons."
MID_OP1_#023,But then a dark presence emerged─Sombron.
MID_OP1_#024,
MID_OP1_#025,"Despite tireless searching, we could not 
determine where he'd come from."
MID_OP1_#026,"But seeing the destruction he wrought, there 
was no doubt of his evil intentions."
MID_OP1_#027,"Now the Corrupted are spreading once more. 
This may be a sign of his return."
MID_OP1_#028,"[Alear] 
No..."
MID_OP1_#029,"[Lumera] 
I wonder if it is mere coincidence that you 
awakened as all this unfolds..."
MID_OP1_#030,"If the Fell Dragon has been released, then we 
must prepare for battle."
MID_OP1_#031,"[Alear] 
I can't imagine fighting someone like that."
MID_OP1_#032,"[Lumera] 
Worry not. I doubt he will attack anytime soon."
MID_OP1_#033,"This castle is filled with the spirits of Divine 
Dragons─the Corrupted cannot enter it easily."
MID_OP1_#034,"Let us devise a plan now, while we have 
the opportunity."

MID_OP1_#036,"[Marth] 4 
[Marth] 
It's been quite some time, Lumera."
MID_OP1_#037,"[Lumera] 
That it has. Thank you for lending your aid 
against the Corrupted."
MID_OP1_#038,"[Marth] 
You're welcome. But of course, I could help 
only because your child remembered me."
MID_OP1_#039,"You know, it is possible the others are awake 
now, just as I am."
MID_OP1_#040,"[Lumera] 
Perhaps you are right."
MID_OP1_#041,"[Alear] 
Sorry, but... What do you mean? Who's awake?"
MID_OP1_#042,"[Lumera] 
There is something I should show you. 
Follow me."
MID_OP2_#001,"[Lumera] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
What is this place?"
MID_OP2_#002,"[Lumera] 
This is the Ring Vault. It is where the Emblem 
Rings are enshrined."
MID_OP2_#003,"Those of the Holy Knight, of the Sage Lord, 
and of the Azure Twins rest here."
MID_OP2_#004,"As well as the Ring of the Princess Exalt and, 
finally, the Ring of the Instructor."
MID_OP2_#005,"Each dwells within an Emblem Ring, as Marth 
resides in the Ring of the Hero-King."
MID_OP2_#006,"[Alear] 
So, counting Marth, there are six Emblem 
Rings. Wow."
MID_OP2_#007,"[Lumera] 
In fact, there are twelve─six here, and six 
entrusted to the other countries."
MID_OP2_#008,As a precautionary measure.
MID_OP2_#009,"[Alear] 
What do you mean?"
MID_OP2_#010,"[Lumera] 
The Emblems grant world-altering power to 
whoever has all 12 rings."
MID_OP2_#011,"For generations, the Divine Dragons used this 
power to ensure peace and prosperity in Elyos."
MID_OP2_#012,"Indeed, that was how we locked away the 
Fell Dragon."
MID_OP2_#013,"But many have sought to steal the rings and use 
them for their own nefarious purposes."
MID_OP2_#014,"[Alear] 
Which is why they're scattered all over the 
continent, not just stored here."
MID_OP2_#015,"[Lumera] 
Precisely. The rings offer their power but once 
every thousand years."
MID_OP2_#016,"At which time the Divine Dragon travels across 
Elyos to collect them from each nation's ruler."
MID_OP2_#017,"With a thousand years having passed since last 
time, I was planning to carry out this ritual soon."
MID_OP2_#018,"But if the Fell Dragon is after the rings, the 
Emblems may be summoned before I arrive..."
MID_OP2_#019,"[Alear] 
""Summoned""?"
MID_OP2_#020,"[Lumera] 
It is how one calls for an Emblem from a ring. 
Just as you did earlier with Marth."
MID_OP2_#021,"Only those with royal dragon blood are capable 
of summoning. That includes you, my child."
MID_OP2_#022,"[Alear] 
Oh... You must be talking about the phrase that 
popped into my head."
MID_OP2_#023,"[Lumera] 
An invocation, you mean? What was it?"
MID_OP2_#024,"[Alear] 
""Shine on, Emblem of Beginnings."""
MID_OP2_#025,"I wasn't even thinking about it. The words just... 
fell from my mouth."
MID_OP2_#026,"[Lumera] 
That was how you summoned Marth."
MID_OP2_#027,...
MID_OP2_#028,"What was your focus─your intention─when you 
spoke those words?"
MID_OP2_#029,"[Alear] 
I wanted to help Clanne and Framme."
MID_OP2_#030,"I didn't want to lose them. I wanted to 
protect them."
MID_OP2_#031,"[Lumera] 
Your focus was on helping others. Remember 
that intention whenever you summon Emblems."
MID_OP2_#032,"Not to keep the power for yourself, understand? 
To borrow so you may protect others."
MID_OP2_#033,"[Alear] 
I understand."
MID_OP2_#034,"[Lumera] 
Now, why don't we try a practice battle? You 
must be a little rusty after all these years."
MID_OP3_#001,"[Lumera] 2 
[Alear] 1 

[Lumera] 
How about we train here? You will be the one 
fighting. The Emblem lends you their strength."
MID_OP3_#002,"You need to train your body and mind to 
unleash an Emblem's full power."
MID_OP3_#003,"Vander, Clanne, Framme. You will be aiding my 
child in this battle...against me."
MID_OP3_#004,"[Vander] 3 

[Vander] 
Queen Lumera, even in a practice battle, I could 
not turn my weapon on you."

Oh, Vander... Please do put your heart into it. 
I know I will."
MID_OP4_#001,"[Lumera] 2

[Alear] 
The Corrupted?!"
MID_OP4_#002,"[Lumera] 
No, dear. Not at all. How could you think so? 
I made these opponents from plants and rocks."
MID_OP4_#003,"Nevertheless, their abilities are the same. 
Drop your guard and you could be hurt."
MID_OP4_#004,"[Alear] 
They're really unsettling. Can we train with 
something else? They give me the chills."
MID_OP4_#005,"[Lumera] 
Listen. You must push through your fear and 
face whatever opponent stands against you."
MID_OP4_#006,"Never run away. You are my child, the protector 
of all─the Divine Dragon ."
MID_OP4_#007,"[Alear] 
I understand."
MID_OP4_#008,"[Framme] 3 
[Framme] 
Don't worry, Divine One! We'll back you up 
every step of the way."
