[Anna] 
Hmm... What's my angle here?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Timerra] 1 

[Timerra] 
Hey, Lady Anna. You're really stressing about 
this new product, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Anna] 
Oh, hey, Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Anna] 
I just know whatever I come up with won't sell 
well in Solm unless it stands out as truly unique."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Timerra] 
Yeah, it's pretty competitive..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Anna] 
What's got you so down?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Timerra] 
Aw, y'know. I just hate to see a friend struggle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Anna] 
That's so sweet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Anna] 
But I'm not really struggling. Well, I am, but it's 
not so bad."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Timerra] 
It's not?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Anna] 
Figuring out the details when I'm working on 
a new product is my favorite part."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Anna] 
""What does this new market need?"" ""How can 
what I'm offering make everyone the happiest?"""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Anna] 
It's not easy, but the thrill I get when I crack the 
problem is worth it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Anna] 
It's the best part of being a merchant!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Timerra] 
Huh, OK! That makes sense!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Anna] 
So don't worry about me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Anna] 
I'll figure this out. And when I do, everyone in 
Solm will love it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Timerra] 
Yeah! That's the spirit!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Timerra] 
You know what? I just thought of something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Anna] 
What's that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Timerra] 
Something you should do after designing this 
fancy new product of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Timerra] 
Be sure to add your name in the title. You know, 
like, ""Lady Anna's Amazing Doodad."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Anna] 
Personal branding?! I don't know, that seems 
a little embarrassing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Timerra] 
Maybe. But if it turns out to be a hit..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Timerra] 
Your family might notice and get in touch 
with you. Right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Anna] 
Whoa. Princess Timerra..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Anna] 
You might have something there! If it works, 
all the credit is yours."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Anna] 2 
[Anna] 
Hey, Princess Timerra! Guess what!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Anna] 
My new product is finally ready to hit the 
market. Wait until you see this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Timerra] 
Yes! I cannot tell you how much I've looked 
forward to this. Come on, let's see it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Anna] 
First, I asked myself, ""What kind of problems do 
the people of Solm face every day?"""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Timerra] 
Hm. High levels of sun exposure, water scarcity, 
bugs─you would not believe the bugs I've seen."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Anna] 
Good guesses, but no."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Anna] 
How many times have you dropped something 
in the sand and never found it again?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Timerra] 
Huh. Well, uh...a few, I guess."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Anna] 
That's where this comes in!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Timerra] 
Oh! A rake. Don't people use that to 
gather leaves?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Anna] 
You must be thinking of some other rake. This 
one's for finding stuff lost in the sands!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Timerra] 
I'm...not following."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Anna] 
Say you drop something and the sand swallows 
it up. Not a problem with your new sand rake!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Anna] 
Well? Pretty handy, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Timerra] 
Ye─ No, not really, no."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Anna] 
I knew it was a reach even while I was saying it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Timerra] 
But hey, it's definitely innovative! I doubt 
anyone else would have come up with that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Anna] 
Thanks for saying so, Princess Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Anna] 
I haven't given up yet. The next product I 
develop will be the talk of Solm!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Timerra] 
Attagirl! You show 'em, Lady Anna!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Anna] 2 
[Anna] 
Hey! Princess Timerra!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Timerra] 
Hey, Lady Anna! What's up?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Anna] 
Quick question─what don't they have enough 
of in the queendom of Solm?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Timerra] 
Haha! Is this a riddle? I love riddles! OK, let's 
think this through..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Anna] 
It's not a riddle, or any other kind of game."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Timerra] 
Oh, it's not? Then why are you asking?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Anna] 
Knowing what's lacking in Solm will help me 
decide what to stock and sell, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Anna] 
I thought if anyone knows all there is to know 
about Solm, it'd be you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Timerra] 
So you came to me for advice on what to 
sell there. Makes sense."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Anna] 
Now that I've been separated from my family, 
I've gotta make a living somehow."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Anna] 
Business is my only real hope."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Timerra] 
You know...Solm already has a lot of merchants. 
It's not the easiest market to break into."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Anna] 
So you're saying that distribution channels for 
standard goods are already well established?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Anna] 
In that case, I'll focus on selling my own unique 
products. That should be enough to compete!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Timerra] 
Ooo, not a bad idea, Lady Anna!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Timerra] 
I'm happy to help you bring a new product to 
the people of Solm. Just lemme know."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Anna] 
Thanks, Princess Timerra. Well, no time to 
waste! I'd better start doing some research."
