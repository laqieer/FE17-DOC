[Boucheron] 
Ninety-eight! Ninety-nine! One hundred!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Ah, I did it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
You did it, Prince Alcryst! You hit one hundred!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Wow. I can't believe it! I'm so happy!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Boucheron] 
I always knew you could. How do you feel? 
Think you've gained any muscle?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alcryst] 
Yes, a little bit. If I flex here, I can feel the 
muscle tighten up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Boucheron] 
Wonderful! And does that help your confidence?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alcryst] 
Not in the slightest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Boucheron] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alcryst] 
I apologize, Boucheron."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alcryst] 
You wasted your precious time on a lost cause."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Boucheron] 
You really shouldn't talk like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alcryst] 
I still can't compare to my brother, Diamant. 
He's so incredible, and I'm so...so..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Where does this come from?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alcryst] 
It's been that way since I was a kid...or, at least, 
that's what people have always told me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Boucheron] 
Well, no wonder you don't have any confidence 
if that's what you've always heard."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Boucheron] 
Look, Prince Alcryst. I'm not always so 
confident either."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alcryst] 
Really? Even though you were blessed with an 
incredible physique?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Boucheron] 
My muscles are well-developed, but inside, I'm 
a softie with a terrible sense of direction."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Boucheron] 
You know what people used to call me? 
""Big Crybaby"" and ""Wrong-Way Strong."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alcryst] 
I don't believe it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Boucheron] 
There are some things I'm self-conscious about. 
But I still get by."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Boucheron] 
Sometimes I wonder if there's anyone in the 
world with true, unshakable confidence."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Boucheron] 
I bet even Prince Diamant has his doubts 
about himself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alcryst] 
Even my brother?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alcryst] 
Haha, such supportive words for a scrawny 
pipsqueak like me. I appreciate it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Boucheron] 
Ah, think nothing of it. I'd do the same for any 
of my best students."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alcryst] 
I believe it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Boucheron] 
You should keep working out. I'd be happy to 
coach you anytime."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Alcryst] 
I will. Thank you, Coach Boucheron."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Boucheron] 
Heh heh, the honor is all mine, Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Alcryst] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Seven! Eight! Nine!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alcryst] 
I─ I can't do any more!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Boucheron] 
What's wrong, Prince Alcyrst? That was only 
nine push-ups."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Boucheron] 
You still have 91 more to go!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Boucheron] 
Was one hundred too much to shoot for at first? 
Should we bring it down to ten?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alcryst] 
No, don't do that. That would dismiss one of 
the zeroes from the target number."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alcryst] 
I'd feel awful for that poor zero, cut from the 
team because of a weakling like me..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Boucheron] 
OK. Let's come back to push-ups later and 
move on to sit-ups for now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Oh. All right... How many sit-ups should I do?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Boucheron] 
A hundred."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alcryst] 
Did you say one hundred?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alcryst] 
No. I can't back out or give up. I have to build 
muscles and grow more confident!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Boucheron] 
That's the spirit! Let's get started!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Boucheron] 
One! Two! Three!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alcryst] 
F-four! Ugh! I can't do any more! My sides are 
being torn apart!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Boucheron] 
Um, Prince Alcryst. You're 96 short of 
your goal."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alcryst] 
I want to make it to one hundred─I really, truly 
do─but my body just can't do it..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Boucheron] 
Hmm... That's a problem, all right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Boucheron] 
Why don't we take a quick break? Let me know 
when you've recovered."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alcryst] 
All right. OK... Ow, ow, ow..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Alcryst] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Hello, Boucheron. May I have a moment of 
your time?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
What can I do for you, Prince Alcryst?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 
I... I came here to beg you to be my coach!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Boucheron] 
What?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alcryst] 
Ah. You're right. I would make a horrible 
student. It was selfish of me to even ask."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Boucheron] 
No, that's not... I just meant to ask, what could 
I possibly teach you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alcryst] 
Well, I... I was hoping you could teach me how 
to build a physique like yours."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Boucheron] 
Oh, you want to bulk up, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alcryst] 
I know I lack confidence. It occurred to me that 
my weak frame might be a part of that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alcryst] 
Then I began to picture myself with some 
actual muscles, and...well..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Boucheron] 
Heh, I get it. You want to build muscle as a 
way of building confidence."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Boucheron] 
Sure. I'd be happy to give you some pointers."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alcryst] 
You will? Oh, that's wonderful! Thank you, 
Boucheron!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alcryst] 
I'm so honored that you're willing to take a 
hopeless case like me under your wing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alcryst] 
Compared to you, I'm just so..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Boucheron] 
OK, my first tip is to stop saying stuff like that! 
Pull yourself together!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alcryst] 
It's OK. You need not console me. Just know 
that I am worthless putty in your capable hands."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Boucheron] 
I think I'm starting to see the bigger hurdles in 
your path."
