[Lapis] 
Rosado, I want to thank you for sharing with me 
the other day. The truth is...I'm different too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Rosado] 
Tell me all about it! I wanna know everything 
unique about you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
Well... My family is, um...poor. Very poor. 
It's always made me feel like an outsider."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
Just being poor would be one thing. But I also 
like wild plant life, and I'm scary strong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Lapis] 
I end up kind of...fixating on my weirdnesses. 
That makes it hard to feel confident."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Rosado] 
None of this sounds bad to me! You know tons 
about plants, you're super strong... That's great!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lapis] 
When you put it that way, they almost do sound 
like positives, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Rosado] 
Still hard to talk about sometimes though, 
isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lapis] 
Yeah."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Rosado] 
If it'll help...I'll give you an embarrassing truth 
of my own. I've always admired you, Lapis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Lapis] 
Wait a second... You? Admired me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Rosado] 
Yup. Even from the time we were enemies, 
back at the Grand Crossing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Rosado] 
You were swinging that huge sword around. 
You were so powerful. So stylish!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Rosado] 
I remember thinking how jealous I was. How I 
could never do something like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Lapis] 
R-really?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Rosado] 
Really. How did you get so strong, anyway? 
Is it all from your training?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Lapis] 
No. It's because I fought off a lot of bears back 
in my hometown."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Rosado] 
Bears! Well, I guess we can say your strength 
goes all the way back to where you came from."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Lapis] 
Yeah... Yeah! I guess you're right!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Lapis] 
Thank you, Rosado. Hearing you say all that, 
I'm feeling much more confident."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lapis] 
One day I'll be able to say with pride, ""I am who 
I am because of my hometown!"""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Lapis] 
Maybe not, uh...anytime soon. But someday."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Rosado] 
I think that's a wonderful goal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Rosado] 
When the time comes, you can announce it 
with a flourish of that huge sword!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Lapis] 
Of course. I'll get an even bigger sword, so you 
can't possibly miss it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1

[Lapis] 
Hey, Rosado. Can I ask you something? It's 
about what we discussed the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Rosado] 
Sure, sure!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lapis] 
You said the secret to cuteness is confidence. 
Well...how did you find your confidence?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Rosado] 
Hmm, I dunno. I think it must have come from 
how I was raised."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lapis] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Rosado] 
I was born in a village near the Lake of Mystery. 
Some people call it the village of the fair folk."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Rosado] 
It's a place of wonder. Beauty beyond the silly 
expectations that come with stuff like gender."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Lapis] 
Wow! I've never heard of such a place."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Rosado] 
Everyone accepts everyone there. However you 
see and present yourself, you're beautiful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Rosado] 
That was my normal, growing up. It was a big 
shock when I left─seeing how different I was!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Rosado] 
But I realized I love being different. And I want 
everyone to know being different is amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lapis] 
You're saying being different...is good?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Rosado] 
Not just good─amazing! Your differences are 
what make you unique. What make you...you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Rosado] 
In a way, being apart from my home village has 
made me even more confident in who I am."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lapis] 
Huh... So your uniqueness became a source of 
confidence. I like that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Rosado] 
Me too! And if it helps you at all, that makes me 
even happier."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Lapis] 
Thanks. Everything you've said has resonated 
with me. Let's chat again soon, all right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Rosado] 
Of course! Anytime!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1

[Lapis] 
You know what, Rosado? You're quite cute. 
I've always thought so."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Rosado] 
Aw, I'm so flattered! Thank you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Lapis] 
The fact that you're so consistently adorable... 
Well, I admire that. What's your secret?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Rosado] 
Hmm... Not sure I've got one."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Rosado] 
I guess I just try to be my best self. I think about 
who I am inside, and...I bring it out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lapis] 
Yeah?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Rosado] 
Sure. Appearances matter, but true beauty 
is what's inside."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Rosado] 
Even the most fashionable ensemble is useless 
if you don't feel it. You've gotta believe in you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lapis] 
Hm... So that's why I'm not cute. There's 
something wrong with what's inside me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Rosado] 
What? Lapis, you're gorgeous."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Lapis] 
No! I'm not confident at all. Really, there's a lot 
that I'm self-conscious about."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lapis] 
Like the fact that I eat grass and shrubs, or that 
I'm so dang strong..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Rosado] 
I didn't catch all that, but I can tell by your 
face it's serious. This really matters to you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Rosado] 
Whatever it is, why don't we talk it over? 
I'll gladly lend you an ear."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Lapis] 
Really? How kind! I appreciate that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Rosado] 
And I appreciate you. Come find me anytime."
