[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Do you remember the first time we met?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Hortensia] 
The very first time?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Well, I'd skipped some grades, which got me 
into the advanced class..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Goldmary] 
It was well before that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Hortensia] 
Wait, it was?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Goldmary] 
Yes. Before the advanced class."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Goldmary] 
I'd accidentally wandered into a skirmish 
between Brodian and Elusian forces."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Goldmary] 
The whole town quickly became a battlefield, 
with me caught in the middle. I was terrified."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Goldmary] 
It was you who got me out of there. 
You saved me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Hortensia] 
Oh! I remember that day!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Hortensia] 
We'd gotten reports of Brodia's surprise attack. 
I went to check on the troops."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Hortensia] 
There was a lone girl who'd gotten left behind... 
That was you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Goldmary] 
It was. I was about to be cut down by a Brodian 
soldier, but you protected me with magic."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Goldmary] 
You pulled me onto your pegasus, flew me to 
safety, and left. Didn't even give me your name."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Goldmary] 
Imagine my surprise when we met for the 
second time in the academy's advanced class."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Why have you never mentioned this before?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Goldmary] 
I was embarrassed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Goldmary] 
I bring it up now because...I want you to know 
how deeply I respect you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Thank you. That really means a lot."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Hortensia] 
I'm glad you told me. And for what it's worth, 
I really respect you too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Hortensia] 
You put your life on the line to keep me safe. 
I couldn't ask for a better friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Hortensia] 
It doesn't hurt that you're adorable either! 
Just being near you makes me look good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Goldmary] 
Haha, you're absolutely right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Hortensia] 
Should I take that to mean you won't be 
leaving my side anytime soon?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Goldmary] 
Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Goldmary] 
I'm your retainer, after all, aren't I?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Goldmary] 
More than that, Hortensia...I'm your friend. 
I will do anything I can to support you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Wow. I'm a terrible cook."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
You're doing great. Follow my lead and this will 
turn out fine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Goldmary] 
You can do this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Get ready to flip it. One swift motion... Now!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Hortensia] 
Ah! I did it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Goldmary] 
You did. It's a little...lopsided, but the flavor 
is what's most important."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Hortensia] 
I hope it tastes good, then. Try it for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Goldmary] 
Mmm! Delicious. It's wonderful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Yes! Soon I'll be every bit as charming and 
talented as you, Goldmary."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Goldmary] 
Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Hehe, with a retainer like you, though, I can't 
let my guard down."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Goldmary] 
A retainer, you say..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Hortensia] 
Something wrong with that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Goldmary] 
Nothing at all, except that Rosado and I are not 
officially your retainers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Oh, I don't care about what's official or not."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Hortensia] 
When the Fell Dragon awakened and the war 
started, we were all just classmates."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Hortensia] 
But Father asked me to return to the castle, 
and one thing led to another."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Goldmary] 
It was Rosado and I who insisted on 
accompanying you home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Yeah, but I wouldn't have had it any other way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Hortensia] 
I didn't even want to leave the academy, much 
less get separated from my friends."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Hortensia] 
But I guess I did rope you into this mess, 
didn't I? I'm sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Goldmary] 
I'm the one who should apologize."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Goldmary] 
Retainers to Elusian royalty are supposed to be 
hand-picked by the king."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Goldmary] 
We ran roughshod over that process. And now 
we'll never be able to get his approval."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Goldmary] 
All because I failed to protect your father."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Hortensia] 
There was nothing any of us could do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Hortensia] 
Besides, he'd have given you both his blessing. 
No doubt in my mind."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Hortensia] 
So I don't want to hear another word about it, 
OK? You have nothing to apologize for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029,"[Goldmary] 
I'm relieved to hear you say that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#030,"[Hortensia] 
And I'm relieved you're here with me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#031,"[Hortensia] 
I hope you'll stay on, even after the war's over. 
Will you accompany me back to the academy?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#032,"[Goldmary] 
I'd consider it a privilege."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Goldmary! I heard a rumor that some gentleman 
callers were asking after you in town."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry that you didn't hear it from me, but it 
happens too often for me to tell you every time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Oh, I'm not mad. So, uh, what did you...do? 
What'd you tell them?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Goldmary] 
I declined as politely as I could."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Hortensia] 
That makes sense. I guess you're pretty used to 
this kind of thing, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
I mean, this has been happening to you for a 
while, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Goldmary] 
Hm, I'm afraid so."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Goldmary] 
I seem to attract that sort of attention 
wherever I go."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if my natural charisma is in any way 
an inconvenience to you..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Hortensia] 
No, that's...not what I mean. That kind of stuff 
just doesn't happen to me, is all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Goldmary] 
It will when you're older."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Hortensia] 
What, like I'm a little kid or something?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Goldmary] 
Of course not."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Hortensia] 
Well, I guess I should look on the bright side. 
You set the standard of charming."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Hortensia] 
I only expect the best from my retainers. 
I'm proud to see you excel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Goldmary] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Hortensia] 
Speaking of excellence, maybe you can teach 
me some of your skills. Cooking, for instance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Goldmary] 
It would be my pleasure."
