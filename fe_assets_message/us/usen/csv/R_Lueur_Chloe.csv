[Alear] 
You know, I've noticed how often you bring up 
your wish to live a fairy-tale life..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Chloé] 
Uh-huh. I've wanted that for myself ever since 
I was a child."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
I was born into a noble family. Everything in my 
life was planned out for me by my parents."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Chloé] 
My role as a noble daughter was to get married 
and then devote myself to my partner's family."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Chloé] 
They wouldn't even let me eat the street food 
I love so much."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Chloé] 
It wasn't ordinary for a noble girl. I hated every 
part of that life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
I had no idea."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Chloé] 
The life I wanted for myself was free, thrilling, 
and very out of the ordinary."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
I didn't mean to stir up so many painful 
memories, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Chloé] 
Oh, it's OK. They're just memories. And my 
dream came true when I got to be a knight."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Chloé] 
Meeting Princess Céline─and you─let me live 
the kind of life I always fantasized about."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Chloé] 
Isn't fighting alongside the Divine Dragon and 
the royal family better than any fairy tale?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
When you put it like that, you might be right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Chloé] 
I wonder if they'll tell stories about this 
war someday."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
It's certainly possible. And when they do..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
I wouldn't be surprised if you ended up as a 
major character in them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Chloé] 
What?! I...never thought about that. But it's a 
nice idea!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Chloé] 
I must become the kind of virtuous knight little 
kids aspire to be when they hear the story."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
You're already well on your way there, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Chloé] 
Haha, thanks, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Chloé] 2 
[Chloé] 
You slept for a thousand years."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
And when you woke, you were thrust into battle 
against the forces of evil."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Chloé] 
You're the absolute picture of a fairy-tale hero!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
Uh...am I?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Chloé] 
Oh yes. One doesn't meet people as 
extraordinary as you every day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Chloé] 
Yours is not the average person's life. You are 
fated for exhilaration and excitement!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Chloé] 
Oh, how I wish it were mine..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
I don't know..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Chloé] 
What? Why not?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
There are many burdens I must bear, and while 
I don't regret this life..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
You're absolutely right that my days will never 
be considered average."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alear] 
Sometimes, average seems like it might not 
be so bad."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Chloé] 
Oh. I'm really sorry about that. I was just so 
swept up in my own desire for a fairy-tale life..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Chloé] 
I didn't stop to consider how someone already 
living one might feel."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
You don't have to apologize, Chloé. I know you 
didn't mean anything by it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Chloé] 
I still feel a little guilty, though."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Chloé] 
Oh, I know! I'll bring you a special, delicious 
treat as an apology."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Chloé] 
There's this rare, pickled, deep-sea fish I've 
been into. It's sour enough to knock you flat!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Chloé] 
I'll go fetch some right now. You're gonna 
love it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alear] 
No need! Really! I'm getting queasy enough 
just picturing it!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Chloé] 2 

[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Chloé] 
Hehehe, you're so adorable when you sleep, 
Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
Huh?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Chloé] 
Oh, good morning. Did I wake you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
Were you watching me sleep? Again?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Chloé] 
Yes. Sorry about that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
You should just leave me be if I nod off while 
I'm sitting outside."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
It's unnerving to wake up on your own and find 
someone staring at you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Chloé] 
Oh, I never mean to do that, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Chloé] 
But you slept for a thousand years, just like 
a character from a fairy tale."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Chloé] 
Your sleeping form is so heavenly that I can't 
help staring at it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
I get that. But I still must have been a ridiculous 
sight, sleeping here of all places."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Chloé] 
Oh, no! Not at all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Chloé] 
But I have a compromise in mind. Hear me out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Chloé] 
If I'm always there when you wake up, maybe 
you'll get used to it and it won't be so startling."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Chloé] 
All we'd have to do is set up an extra bed for 
me in your chamber."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Nope! Not doing that!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Chloé] 
Oh dear. Shot down..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Chloé] 2 

[Alear] 
I think you've been rubbing off on me, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Chloé] 
I have? How?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
Just like you wish for a fairy-tale life, I've been 
thinking about a dream life of my own."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Chloé] 
Well, I think that's wonderful!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Chloé] 
Now that you have an idea of what your dream 
is, you can start to make it real."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
It might not be that simple."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
There are parts of this dream I can't fulfill 
by myself."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Chloé] 
What else do you need?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
You, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Chloé] 
Me?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
When I think about the life I want after the war, 
it feels hollow if you're not in it somewhere."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
And if you're the hero of your own fairy tale, 
I want to be your supporting character."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Chloé] 
Oh my goodness..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
If you feel the same way, then I hope you'll 
accept this gift."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
I saved it just for you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Chloé] 
This is the Pact Ring..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
You were right when you said that mine is not 
the average person's life."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
And it may be a lot to ask for you to share in 
that life, knowing it won't be ordinary."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
But I had to know."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Chloé] 
You had only to ask, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Chloé] 
I never wanted an ordinary life. The chance to 
see myself in your story..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Chloé] 
I can't think of a happier ending than that."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
Well?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Chloé] 
Of course I'll wear the ring. And I'll be right 
there, building your dream along with you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Chloé."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Chloé] 
Today is the opening chapter of the tale of the 
Divine One and me. A story for the ages!"
