[Diamant] 
This is bad. We have to do something..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
I've ruined the banquet. I'm sorry, Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
I had no idea your favorite dishes were all so 
incredibly, dangerously spicy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Diamant] 
We can't serve this to the townsfolk...can we?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Veyle] 
I─ I don't know."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Veyle] 
I love super spicy food. I just assumed everyone 
else would love it too. I'm so, so, so sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Diamant] 
You did nothing wrong, Lady Veyle. It's my 
fault for not asking about the menu before now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
I wanted to help, but all I did was make more 
trouble for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Veyle] 
I really thought we could make everyone smile."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Diamant] 
Make everyone smile..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Diamant] 
That's it! I've got it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Veyle] 
You do?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Diamant] 
We'll turn this dinner into a spicy-food eating 
contest. That's guaranteed to liven things up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Veyle] 
A contest to see who has the...toughest mouth? 
That will help you connect with people?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Diamant] 
As opposed to a quiet meal? In Brodia? Yes! 
I'll be laughing and cheering right beside them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Veyle] 
That's wonderful! I get to help you and you 
get to help your people...with spicy food!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Diamant] 
Today's going to be a good day, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Veyle] 
Just so you know, I will probably win the 
contest."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Diamant] 
Ha! I won't be easy to beat, that I promise you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Veyle] 
We'll find out soon enough. Everyone is on 
their way. The heat is on!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1

[Veyle] 
Hello, Diamant. Tell me, is anything troubling 
you today?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Diamant] 
Ah. Normally I would give you the same ""not 
today"" reply, but not this time..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Diamant] 
Something is troubling me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Veyle] 
Really?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Veyle] 
I will solve it, I promise! Just tell me what it is."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Diamant] 
We went through town before to try and find 
people who needed help. Remember?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Veyle] 
Of course. We didn't find anyone, though. 
Not a single person."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Diamant] 
Yes, well, I spoke with a guard who told me 
the townsfolk actually have a lot of problems."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Veyle] 
But...why didn't they tell us?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Diamant] 
Everyone knows that I'm the crown prince, so 
they're afraid to approach me or speak with me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Veyle] 
Oh, I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Diamant] 
I must find a way to let my people know that 
I want─ No, I need to hear from them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Diamant] 
I'm just not sure how to do that..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Veyle] 
Oh! That's easy! I know exactly what to do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Diamant] 
If you have an idea, I'm all ears."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Veyle] 
Well, there's a type of food I really love. It's 
delicious and very exciting to eat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Veyle] 
So I could prepare the food, and you could host 
a banquet. It would be our treat to everyone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Diamant] 
Ahh, I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Diamant] 
If we host an informal dinner for the town, then 
people might not find me so intimidating..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Veyle] 
Exactly! Food is the perfect way to win people's 
hearts. I'll begin preparations immediately."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1

[Veyle] 
Diamant, is there anything that's troubling 
you right now?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Diamant] 
Lady Veyle? Why the sudden concern?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Veyle] 
I did...something awful to you. I want to atone 
for what I've done...if I can."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Diamant] 
Do you mean my father? You don't need to 
atone for that. You weren't yourself then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Veyle] 
Still, I want to make things right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Diamant] 
I see. If I were in your position, I would be 
offering the same sort of gesture."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Diamant] 
I have to be honest... Nothing is troubling me at 
the moment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Diamant] 
Though, I wonder... Would you be interested in 
working with me to help other people?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Veyle] 
Other people?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Diamant] 
As the crown prince of Brodia, easing the minds 
of the people in my kingdom is my job."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Diamant] 
If you help me alleviate their burdens, I would 
consider that a great service."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Diamant] 
What do you say, Lady Veyle?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Veyle] 
I'd say yes, I like the sound of that very much!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Veyle] 
Hmm, how strange."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Veyle] 
We walked around town all day long and 
couldn't find anyone who needed our help."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Diamant] 
I'm surprised too. Not a single person was 
distressed or in need of assistance..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Diamant] 
I suppose that's an odd thing to be upset about. 
We should be glad."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Diamant] 
I'm grateful that today was a good day for 
my people."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Veyle] 
Yes, but...that won't help me make up for what 
I did to you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Diamant] 
Well, not today, no...but how about this?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Diamant] 
Someday, something will trouble me. When that 
day comes...promise you'll help me solve it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Diamant] 
Will that suffice, Lady Veyle?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#024,"[Veyle] 
Yes, it will. Thank you, Diamant."
