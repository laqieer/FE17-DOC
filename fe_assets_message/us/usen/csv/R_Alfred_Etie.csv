[Alfred] 
Good morning, Etie! Any suggestions for our 
early workout?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Etie] 
How about a run?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
Sounds good. Wanna make it a race?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Etie] 
Nah. I'd prefer to run alongside. Easier to keep 
you safe that way."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alfred] 
Makes sense. Oh, look."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Etie] 
Is something wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alfred] 
No, I just noticed how beautiful those flowers 
are. Let's put the run on hold for a minute."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Etie] 
As you wish."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alfred] 
You know what pretty flowers always remind 
me of?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alfred] 
This memory I have of you with an armload 
of them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Etie] 
My hometown is known for those flowers. 
I used to bring some anytime I visited the castle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alfred] 
I remember. My mother and the servants 
loved them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Etie] 
Good. I'm glad."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alfred] 
Speaking of Mother, you wanna hear 
something funny?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alfred] 
She originally thought you might be the one to 
become my queen."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Etie] 
You're kidding. That's the first I've heard of it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Etie] 
But that does explain some things."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Etie] 
Now I get why I was assigned to you instead of 
Princess Céline, my childhood friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Etie] 
I've wondered about that for years. Mystery 
solved, I guess."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alfred] 
That must have bugged you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Etie] 
Don't be ridiculous. I'm proud to be your 
retainer, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Etie] 
Though it's a bit of a shock to try to imagine 
myself as your queen."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Etie] 
Queen Etie..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alfred] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Etie] 
Hehe!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Alfred] 
Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Etie] 
Apologies to Queen Ève, but I can't picture it 
no matter how hard I try."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alfred] 
Me neither. I try to imagine us as anything but 
what we are now and my brain freezes up."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Etie] 
I know what you mean."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Etie] 
Our bond as prince and retainer is too strong 
to be anything else."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Alfred] 
Workout partners too. Don't forget that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Etie] 
Heh. Always, Prince Alfred."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Etie] 
Speaking of which, shouldn't we get going on 
that run? I'm getting antsy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Alfred] 
Lead the way, Etie. Every day spent training 
with you is a gift."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Alfred] 
To strength! And to peace."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Etie] 
And to your happiness."

[Alfred] 
Hmm... You're sure about this?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Etie] 
Extremely."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Etie] 
You're not leaving until you've drank every drop 
of my new and improved muscle stimulant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alfred] 
Well, anything for strength!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Etie] 
That's the spirit."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Etie] 
I put a lot of research into this one. I guarantee 
you'll see results."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alfred] 
That's great news! Thanks for putting so much 
effort into this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alfred] 
It's just... You couldn't have done anything 
about the smell?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Etie] 
Sorry. You'll have to hold your nose."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Etie] 
It was unavoidable with all the different 
ingredients I used."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alfred] 
Like what exactly?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Etie] 
In researching this drink, I interviewed a lot 
of hardbodies."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Etie] 
I found out their favorite foods so that I could 
mix them all into one potent stew."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alfred] 
All of them? At once?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Etie] 
Well, all of those plus a few other things I 
thought might help."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alfred] 
And...how does it taste?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Etie] 
Couldn't tell you. I haven't tried it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alfred] 
Unbelievable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alfred] 
You waited until I could try it first before having 
any for yourself? I'm touched, Etie!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Etie] 
It's all part of the job."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alfred] 
Aw, I'm ashamed to have been so nitpicky over 
little things like taste and smell."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alfred] 
I want you to know how grateful I am, Etie."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alfred] 
Bottoms up! To strength!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Etie] 
To strength!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Alfred] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Alfred] 
Ahhhh."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Etie] 
Well? What did you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Alfred] 
One thing's for sure..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#029,"[Alfred] 
It's not fit for human consumption."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#030,"[Etie] 
I was afraid of that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1

[Alfred] 
Amazing...weather we're having today, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Etie] 
Too true. It's the perfect day for a cup of tea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alfred] 
Especially the tea you prepare, Etie. It's my 
favorite of all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Etie] 
That's...kind of you to say. Would you like 
another cup?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alfred] 
N-no. I'd better not..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Etie] 
If... If you say so... Ngh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alfred] 
Aaagh! I can't...hold it...anymore... I'm out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Etie] 
Your cup is down first. I win."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
Yep. Fair play, Etie. I got no excuse."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alfred] 
Although I could swear our special workout 
teacups seem heavier today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Etie] 
Well spotted. I did add some weight, in fact."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alfred] 
No wonder I had such trouble just lifting it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Etie] 
Don't whine. The road to muscle gain is long 
and bumpy, and you've just begun."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Etie] 
Teatime will only get harder from here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alfred] 
I expect nothing less. Let's raise our teacups 
to strength!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Etie] 
To strength!"
