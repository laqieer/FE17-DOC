[Yunaka] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Heya, Zelkov. Would you mind if we talked 
a teensy bit more about our trade?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Why the sudden change of *heart*? You were 
quite clear that you didn't wish to discuss it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah, yeah. I know what I said. I was there the 
whole time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
I was worried talking about it too much would 
be...too much. But it hasn't been."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Yunaka] 
The opposite, actually. Talking about it's helped 
me get distance. Perspective, y'know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Zelkov] 
Care to elaborate?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Yunaka] 
Look, people like us don't often get the chance 
to speak candidly. It could be a good thing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Zelkov] 
Perhaps you're right. But even so, what is left 
for us to *converse* about, exactly?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Zelkov] 
The story of how I came to such a profession 
is not one I am *keen* to tell."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Zelkov] 
I'm afraid it's a rather tragic tale. Ill-suited for 
any sort of *pleasant* conversation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah. Honestly, that whole chapter of my life 
was pretty dang awful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Zelkov] 
It was the same for me. Not even the most 
difficult *challenges* we face today compare."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Zelkov] 
But I would venture to suppose that you did 
not *choose* to embark upon a life of killing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Yunaka] 
What makes you say that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Zelkov] 
I get the sense, merely by observing, that you 
genuinely have *no* regrets."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Zelkov] 
From this observation I inferred you may not 
have been *responsible* for your circumstances."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Yunaka] 
Good inference..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Zelkov] 
Moreover, your present self was formed as a 
*result* of growing apart from your past."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Zelkov] 
In a way, then...if you are the blossom, your 
past is the fertilizer which *nourished* you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Yunaka] 
That's...really insightful, actually. Thanks."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Yunaka] 
Words have weight, Zelkov, and every one 
of yours is big and heavy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Yunaka] 
But it's funny. Hearing them somehow makes 
me feel lighter. Maybe it's our common bond."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Zelkov] 
You flatter me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Yunaka] 
I've been thinking about what I'll do when all 
this is over. When the world's finally peaceful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Yunaka] 
What I want most is to go someplace where 
I can kick back. Put my feet up. Luxuriate!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Zelkov] 
I will say that does *sound* lovely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Yunaka] 
If and when that happens, I hope you'll drop in 
on me once in a while."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Zelkov] 
I would gladly make an appearance. There will 
be conversations *only* you and I can have."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Yunaka] 
Ooo, yes! Love it! We'll do each other's hair, 
trade weapon factoids. Whatever we want!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Zelkov] 
Indeed... Let us work toward that eventuality 
as our *common* goal from now on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Yunaka] 
It's a promise, then. If we've got the same dark 
past, we may as well share a bright future."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 

[Zelkov] 
About what we discussed *previously,* 
Yunaka..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
That's so weird! I told you not to make a thing 
of it, and yet here you are. Making things."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Zelkov] 
That message was well received. I only wished 
to discuss *one* more detail."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Zelkov] 
You said that a killer instinct *oozes* from my 
pores. I believe you used the word ""slime."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Zelkov] 
What did you mean by that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Zelkov] 
Please. It is crucial to my *well-being* that I am 
able to curate the image I present to others."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Yunaka] 
Fine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Yunaka] 
Look. You're a hunter. Everything you do and 
say is about the kill."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Zelkov] 
Could you indulge me with an *example*?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Yunaka] 
OK, sure. Take your eyes, for *example.* 
They're ice cold. Calculating."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Yunaka] 
Normal people don't go around evaluating what 
folks' lives are worth. That's an assassin thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Yunaka] 
You're always probing for weaknesses too. 
Considering vectors of attack, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Zelkov] 
That is *not* what I..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Yunaka] 
Seriously, bud? You're doing it right now!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Yunaka] 
Look at yourself. Tell me you're not poised to 
counter a knife thrust from my dominant hand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Yunaka] 
You're constantly positioning to maximize your 
tactical advantage. Don't think I don't see it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Zelkov] 
Perceptive..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Yunaka] 
Regular people don't think about violence so 
much in everyday life. That's what I meant."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Zelkov] 
To think that I should be so *transparent* 
to you..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Yunaka] 
Sharp eyes were part of the old job, as I'm sure 
you know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Zelkov] 
I appreciate your insightful analysis. I will 
*reflect* on what you've said."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah, don't mention it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Ugh, I'm not interested in playing your goofy 
game, Zelkov. Just tell me what you're after."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Why, Yunaka, what *game* do you think 
I am playing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Yunaka] 
The stalking game, by the look of it. Don't act 
like you don't know the rulebook backwards!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Zelkov] 
So you've noticed, have you? How *curious.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Zelkov] 
You have the perceptive powers of a *hunter.* 
Do you perchance hunt for sport...or for money?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Zelkov] 
At last, the truth is *written* on your face. I'd 
suspected you made your trade in violence."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Zelkov] 
That is why I've *stalked* you, as you put it. 
Suspicious persons ought to be observed."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Yunaka] 
OK, I'll admit it. You've got some chops."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Now, what say we rattle your brains around 
a bit and see what shakes out?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Zelkov] 
Oh my. Be gentle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Yunaka] 
You've got the same killer instinct I do. 
It practically oozes from your pores. Like slime!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Yunaka] 
So, tell me. Have we had similar careers?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Zelkov] 
That does *appear* to be the case."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Yunaka] 
Great. Well, let's not speak of it again, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Yunaka] 
My work is in the past. I'm happily retired."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Zelkov] 
I, too, have washed my *hands* of that life."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Yunaka] 
So we have that in common too, huh? Well, let's 
not make a thing of it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Yunaka] 
Look, here's me not making a thing. See ya."
