[Fogado] 
Timerra! I've solved it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
Huh? Did something need solving? First I'm 
hearing of it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
Here, take this. I stayed up all night making it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
A doll? Why did you... Wait."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Timerra] 
No way─it's YOU! This is a YOU doll!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Fogado] 
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Fogado] 
Now we'll always be together. You don't have 
to feel lonely anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Fogado] 
Even when I'm away from the castle, it'll be like 
I'm right there with you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Fogado] 
And he'll keep you safe."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Timerra] 
Ugh, you ruined it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Timerra] 
I'm not a little kid. What's a doll gonna protect 
me from? Doll bandits?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Fogado] 
Ah..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Timerra] 
Besides, this thing hardly even looks like you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Timerra] 
I'd have to squint something fierce to pretend 
that Faux-gado here is the real article."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Fogado] 
I worked so hard on him, though. You don't 
think he has his dad's signature swagger?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Timerra] 
Yeah, no, not even a little bit. Guess you have 
no choice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Timerra] 
You'll just have to hang out with me more."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Timerra] 
We're the princess and prince, but first and 
foremost, we're sibbies."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Fogado] 
Yeah, you're right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Fogado] 
You win. I'll spend less time wandering Solm 
and more time with you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Timerra] 
Good! Was that so hard?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Fogado] 
I guess you won't be needing that doll."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Timerra] 
I didn't say that! I'm going to give my 
wonky-looking nephew here a loving home."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Fogado] 
Hahaha, perfect. Though just so you know, 
he doesn't eat meat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Fogado] 
Hey, listen. I want to talk about something."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Timerra] 
What's up, Fogado? You look kinda down."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Fogado] 
Yeah, well... I think I owe you an apology."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Timerra] 
I knew it! You're the one who stole my rib tips! 
I was saving those for a late-night snack."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Fogado] 
What?! No, I would never do that! I know how 
much you love your midnight meats!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Fogado] 
Wait a second. What's this ""I knew it"" business? 
You don't trust your own brother?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Timerra] 
Hehe! Hehe, sorry, sorry. I get cranky when 
I wake up on an empty stomach."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Timerra] 
Anyway, what was that about an apology?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Fogado] 
I was thinking about what you said. How I 
wasn't around much in the castle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Fogado] 
I've always felt that because our people are free 
spirits, they deserve a free-spirited prince."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Fogado] 
But now I realize that it got in the way of our 
sibby time. I'll try to do better from now on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Timerra] 
Listen, Fogado."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Timerra] 
I know that ""free spirit"" stuff doesn't tell the 
whole story."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Timerra] 
You leave the castle to get a lay of the land. 
Make it easier to plan for a crisis. Right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Timerra] 
So that if the worst happens, you'll be ready to 
advise me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Fogado] 
Hahaha, of course you knew."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Timerra] 
Well, yeah. We are sibbies, aren't we?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Timerra] 
I know everything that's going on in that cute, 
little head of yours!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Timerra] 
I do appreciate all you do for me. As far as little 
brothers go, I'd say I lucked out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Fogado] 
We're family. We watch out for each other."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Timerra] 
If I'm honest, though...sometimes I don't want 
you to watch out for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Timerra] 
I just want you to hang out with me. You know?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Timerra] 
Like right now. This is perfect."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Fogado] 2 

[Timerra] 
Well, well! If it isn't Fogado, my one and only 
sibby, hehehe!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Fogado] 
Hahaha, yes! In the flesh. Care to tell me why 
you're in such a good mood?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Timerra] 
Oh, no reason in particular."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Fogado] 
Really? I would have guessed there was a song 
or a slab of meat involved."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Fogado] 
Mind, I'm glad to see you looking so cheery. 
Always puts a smile on my face."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Timerra] 
Well, good! Because I'm happy as can be."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Fogado] 
But I'm going to have to insist you tell me why. 
Come on─sibby to sibby."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Timerra] 
If you really wanna know..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Timerra] 
It's because you're here! Duh!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Fogado] 
Is that all? Pfft, I'm always here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Timerra] 
Oh ho! Hate to break it to you, but no."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Timerra] 
I'll admit, back in Solm, I didn't spend all that 
much time in the castle. But you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Timerra] 
You were never around! I hardly spent time 
with you at all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Fogado] 
Ah, yeah. You make a good point."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Timerra] 
These aren't what you'd call the best 
circumstances, but I'm glad I see you every day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Fogado] 
Wow. You really put a positive spin on things."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Fogado] 
We're in the middle of a war, and you make it 
sound like a family vacation."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Timerra] 
Got a problem with that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Fogado] 
Not one bit. As I said, I'm just happy that 
you're happy."
