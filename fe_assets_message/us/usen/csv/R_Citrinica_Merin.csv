[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Citrinne, I need to talk to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Merrin! Hello! Have they decided on a new 
opening date for your play yet?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
It's about that. I'm so sorry. I...lied about 
the play."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Oh my. What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Merrin] 
I love rare critters. And I spotted not one but 
two! I was so excited, I...I acted ridiculous."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Merrin] 
Then you saw me, and that lie...it just flew out 
of my mouth...like an Elusian albatross."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Citrinne] 
An Elusian alba─ Wait, I'm not sure I follow... 
Why would you lie about a thing like that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Merrin] 
You told me you thought I was cool, remember? 
Well, you caught me being...a clown."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Merrin] 
I did NOT want you to see me like that. And I 
didn't want to disappoint you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Citrinne] 
Ah, I think I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Merrin] 
I'm sorry, I won't lie to you again. And I won't 
let you see me act so disgracefully either."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Citrinne] 
Merrin, you needn't worry about any of that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Citrinne] 
I'm not disappointed, and I don't think you did 
anything disgraceful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Citrinne] 
I'm actually thankful to have caught a glimpse 
of the real you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Merrin] 
I don't understand."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Citrinne] 
It's like I discovered an entirely new, entirely 
charming side of you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Merrin] 
A charming side? What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Citrinne] 
I see your cool side during battle...and now I 
know you have a cute side around animals."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Merrin] 
I don't know about that..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Citrinne] 
Tell me, Merrin... Have you heard of a certain 
forest in Brodia that's home to rare wildlife?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Merrin] 
I have. It's on the royal family's private 
property."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Citrinne] 
Would you like to visit it together when this war 
is over? I could reserve a day for the two of us."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Citrinne] 
There's a chance we might discover a new 
species in there! We should bring a scholar."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Merrin] 
Wait, slow down. Wouldn't that be expensive?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, it wouldn't be any trouble─or cost! One of 
my relatives owns the forest. They protect it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Merrin] 
Citrinne, are you related to the royal family?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Citrinne] 
I am! So please, don't worry. That forest will be 
a perfect, private spot to frolic among fauna."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Citrinne] 
I want you to fully embrace that adorable, 
animal-loving side of yourself once again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Merrin] 
I don't know what to say. It...means the world 
to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Merrin] 
Honestly, I can't wait! And I will find a way 
to repay you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Citrinne] 
All I ask is that you help me spot animals during 
our trip. You can be my personal wildlife expert!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Merrin] 
Haha, personal wildlife expert. I like that title. 
And I can't think of anything I'd like to do more."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Whoa! Will you look at that! An endangered 
Brodian red swallow! Very rare indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Merrin] 
Wait! Where are you flitting off to now, you 
gorgeous thing you? What a beautiful creature..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Merrin] 
Is that an Elusian albatross?! I didn't know they 
migrated through here!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Merrin] 
And where do you think you're going?! Please, 
take me with you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Citrinne] 
Um...Merrin? What are you doing?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Merrin] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Merrin] 
I─ Uh, nothing..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Merrin] 
What, uh, are you doing? Wait, were you 
watching me just now?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Citrinne] 
Yes... I didn't mean to intrude. I couldn't help 
myself actually."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Citrinne] 
Your frolicking reminded me of a clown I once 
saw perform."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Merrin] 
Aw..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Merrin] 
You don't say? I, uh, actually... I'm going to 
be...in a play! Yes, I am. Me. Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Citrinne] 
A play? How wonderful!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Merrin] 
Nothing fancy. Just a small production. And you 
are exactly right. I am, in fact, playing a clown."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Citrinne] 
Ah, I called it! What an interesting role for you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Merrin] 
Isn't it though? A real stretch from the calm, 
cool, everyday, cool me. I have to act. A lot."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Merrin] 
A real challenge, you know? You can't be this 
cool and then be a clown, without digging deep."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Citrinne] 
When is your play? You must tell me so I can 
attend on opening night."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Merrin] 
What now?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Merrin] 
I mean, that's a good question. I wrote it down 
somewhere. I'll have to check...in my...pockets?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Merrin] 
But...I also heard a rumor it might get canceled. 
Not for sure but probably. Definitely for sure."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Citrinne] 
Oh no! Please, if it's a matter of funding, you 
must, must, must let me help."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Merrin] 
Nope! Not a money thing. It was...there were... 
creative differences! Psh, actors. So difficult!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Citrinne] 
Ah, well, those things always blow over. Let me 
know when they find a new date. I'll be there."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Merrin] 
I will be sure to do that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Merrin] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Merrin! I've been meaning to tell you─fighting 
alongside you is a thrill. You're quite...cool!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Merrin] 
Me? Cool? Haha, you're too kind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Merrin] 
But since you mentioned it, can you be more 
specific? How, exactly, am I cool? Just curious."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, my. Where to start?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Citrinne] 
You just seem so fearless out there! It's like 
watching a brave knight in action."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Merrin] 
A brave knight, eh? I like the sound of that. 
Anything else?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Oh? Shall I go on?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Merrin] 
Well, I try my best to be, as you put it...cool. 
But I don't always know if it's working, I guess."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Citrinne] 
That...is a bit unexpected."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Citrinne] 
I wouldn't have guessed that a woman like you 
would be concerned with others' opinions."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Merrin] 
Oh, I am. During battle, one must maintain 
an air of cool. Revealing weakness can be fatal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Merrin] 
I mean, lose your cool on the battlefield...or off 
the battlefield...and you're asking to get hurt."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Merrin] 
No matter what anyone says, appearances are 
important. You see?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Citrinne] 
Yes...I do see. Though it must be very difficult 
to keep that in mind on the battlefield...and off."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Merrin] 
I'm sorry, but I better get going. I've got to get 
back to my training."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Merrin] 
But thank you for the talk, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Citrinne] 
It was nice to catch up. Best of luck with 
your training."
