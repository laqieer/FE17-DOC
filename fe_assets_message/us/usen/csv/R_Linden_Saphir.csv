MID_RELIANCE_A_#001,"[Saphir] 2 

[Saphir] 
Now that is how you fillet a fish."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Lindon] 1 

[Lindon] 
I must say, you handle a fillet knife splendidly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
Lindon..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lindon] 
It's quite something to see such a large fish 
gutted and cleaned in a matter of moments."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Saphir] 
No, not really. Any kid growing up near the 
water can do the same by about seven."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Lindon] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lindon] 
Saphir, about our last conversation..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Saphir] 
Anyway, you've got perfect timing!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Saphir] 
I was just about to sear this fish. Wanna lend 
me your magic touch? C'mon, do the honors!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Lindon] 
Er, I would be glad to, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Saphir] 
Our earlier conversation's weighing on you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Lindon] 
I'm afraid so."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Lindon] 
I cannot deny that I took part in the war that 
cost your parents their lives."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lindon] 
I would understand completely if you held 
a grudge against me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Saphir] 
With all due respect, Lindon...drop this before 
I lose my cool."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lindon] 
I'm sorry?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Saphir] 
My problem isn't with you. It's with the war."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Saphir] 
If I held grudges against everyone involved, it'd 
never end. I've seen enough to understand that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Lindon] 
I suppose, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Saphir] 
I mean it. You're not doing me any favors 
taking on that burden."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lindon] 
You're right. I see now that I was being 
entirely foolish."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Saphir] 
Not entirely. You've shown you care. That 
means something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Saphir] 
Now, are you gonna sear this fish for me 
or what? We've got hungry folks waiting!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Lindon] 
Then there's no time to waste! No more 
apologies─I've got bigger fish to fry!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Saphir] 2 

[Lindon] 
Saphir, may I speak to you for a moment?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Saphir] 
Of course, Lindon. What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Lindon] 
Your guess that I was an Elusian soldier about 
30 years ago was correct."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lindon] 
That said, my tour of duty never brought me to 
any rural fishing villages."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Saphir] 
You looked into this─into where I'm from."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Lindon] 
Indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Saphir] 
All right. I'll say it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Saphir] 
Elusia attacked my home village 30 years ago. 
A lot of folks were killed...my parents included."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Saphir] 
It's not that I'm on a revenge quest or anything. 
I haven't been searching for their killers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Saphir] 
But if you were a soldier in Elusia at that time... 
I couldn't help but wonder..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Lindon] 
No, no, your suspicions are only natural. I would 
wonder the same thing in your shoes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Saphir] 
I still shouldn't have asked. We're on the same 
side now. There's no need to dig this up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Lindon] 
If you want to hate me, Saphir, you have 
the right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Lindon] 
Even if you wanted me dead, I'd allow it if it 
would ease your pain."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Saphir] 
What?! Why would you say that?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Lindon] 
Because I mean it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Lindon] 
I may not have done any harm to your parents 
personally, but I was a soldier in that war."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Lindon] 
I can easily see a world in which it was I who 
ended your parents' lives."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Saphir] 
I..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Lindon] 
I am a man long past his prime. I'd happily go to 
my end if it would bring you relief."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Lindon] 
And although words can change nothing now... 
I do apologize. I am truly, profoundly sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Saphir] 
I can't do this. Excuse me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Saphir] 

[Lindon] 
Oh dear..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Saphir] 2 

[Saphir] 
Excuse me, Lindon. Do you mind if I ask you 
a bit of an odd question?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Lindon] 
Ask away, Saphir."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Saphir] 
Well..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Saphir] 
Actually, uh, never mind. Forget I said anything."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lindon] 
Hmm. You seemed quite solemn about it, 
whatever it was."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lindon] 
There was pain there as well. As though 
something weighs heavily on your heart."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lindon] 
I think you should go ahead and come out 
with it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Saphir] 
OK."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Saphir] 
About 30 years ago... You'd already begun 
your career as a soldier of Elusia, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Lindon] 
Indeed, I had."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Lindon] 
I joined as a royal soldier almost immediately 
upon graduating Elusia's national academy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Saphir] 
You must have taken part in campaigns 
against Brodia around that time, then."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Lindon] 
Yes... Yes, I did."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Saphir] 
If I were to name a town or a village in Brodia... 
Would you remember if..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Saphir] 
No, this is inappropriate. I shouldn't be asking."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lindon] 
Saphir, I, er..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Saphir] 
I'm sorry to bother you. I hope I didn't offend."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Saphir] 

[Lindon] 
Well, now. This bears some looking into."
