[Alfred] 
Hey, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
Your Highness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
All those dishes you cooked up, and I'm still 
as scrawny as ever."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Bunet] 
I failed, then. You have my deepest apologies."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alfred] 
Aw, it's not your fault! You went all-out and 
it showed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alfred] 
Plus, every dish was good eating. 
My compliments to the chef."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alfred] 
No, the real trouble is just that I'm weak to 
the core."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Bunet] 
Please, do not be so hard on yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Bunet] 
These dishes may have failed in bulking up 
your slender form."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Bunet] 
But it was not for nothing. All that meat did 
result in a different sort of change."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alfred] 
I'm not following you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Bunet] 
Our flavor. Yours and mine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alfred] 
We have a flavor?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Bunet] 
You see, we were once dry and bland, but as 
our bond deepened, our taste became richer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Bunet] 
Perhaps that was a bad way to put it..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alfred] 
No, I see what you mean! We brought out 
new flavors in each other!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alfred] 
Before, we were raw ingredients. But now, 
we're, uh, what do you call it? Fusion cuisine!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Bunet] 
Yes, my thinking exactly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Bunet] 
And now I often find myself fondly thinking 
about your vibrant zing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alfred] 
I guess it's true what they say, ""the way to a 
man's heart is through his stomach."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Bunet] 
I have always thought so. To that end, I should 
quite like to cook for you again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alfred] 
Oooh, really? What did you have in mind?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Bunet] 
I was planning to make a vegetable dish with 
one of your sweet flowers ground on top."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Bunet] 
And perhaps some grilled fish to counterbalance 
all the meat from last time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alfred] 
I'm working up an appetite just listening to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Bunet] 
Continue to eat my cooking and...who knows?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Bunet] 
You may one day have the body you desire."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alfred] 
Here's hoping, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Alfred] 
Someday, my muscles are gonna be as strong 
as our friendship!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Bunet] 
Hmm... A note of sweetness..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
That the flower I got you from Firene? Does 
it, uh, taste as good as you'd hoped?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Bunet] 
Yes. Like a lavish royal dance on the tongue. 
I expect it will go well in a salad."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Bunet] 
So this is how Firenese royalty tastes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alfred] 
Well, it's just a flower."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alfred] 
Anyway! I hear you've been busy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Bunet] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Bunet] 
I have been hard at work preparing a dish to 
round out your muscles."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Bunet] 
It is ready at last."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alfred] 
Thanks!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alfred] 
And eating this will give me the firm muscles 
I've wanted for so long, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Bunet] 
In theory, yes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alfred] 
Sure. Nothing's guaranteed, after all. 
Still worth a try."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Bunet] 
Indeed. In that case, I will bring it out for you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alfred] 
Hmmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Bunet] 
How does it look?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alfred] 
It looks like...meat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alfred] 
Meat, cooked in meat sauce, on top of a bed 
of thinly sliced meat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Bunet] 
Well, yes. Meat, being muscle, begets muscle. 
Such was my uninformed hunch."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Bunet] 
Thus I figured that the more meat you ate, 
the more muscle you would grow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alfred] 
That math checks out. I can tell you thought 
pretty hard about all this!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alfred] 
And to show my thanks, I'm gonna destroy 
this meal!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alfred] 
Time me!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Bunet] 
What an appetite he has. I am glad to see my 
dish being enjoyed so...immediately."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Bunet] 
We can only sow these beefy seeds and wait, 
hoping that a bounty of muscles springs forth."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Bunet] 
I have no evidence it will work, but well... 
Miracles happen."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Bunet] 2 
[Bunet] 
Prince Alfred. Might I ask you for a quick lick?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alfred] 
Run that by me again, Bunet..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Bunet] 
Forgive me, sir. I can explain more clearly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Bunet] 
Those flowers you're wearing. I should quite 
like to acquaint one of them with my taste buds."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alfred] 
You wanna taste a flower?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Bunet] 
Hm, I seem to have crossed a line. Please 
disregard my request."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alfred] 
Hahaha! You're a riot, Bunet!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alfred] 
It's no big deal. I'll see if I can get you a flower 
like these."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
You can taste it to your heart's content."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Bunet] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alfred] 
Speaking of which, Bunet, you're looking 
pretty beefy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Bunet] 
Beefy, you say. Do you mean you would like to 
have a quick lick yourself?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alfred] 
Uh, no, I'm good. I was just paying you a 
compliment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alfred] 
Wish I could get muscles like yours, but they 
never seem to develop for me like they should."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Bunet] 
Hm... Perhaps you could bulk up by changing 
your diet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Bunet] 
If you'd like, I can cook up something nice and 
hearty for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alfred] 
No fooling?! I'd love that!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Bunet] 
Understood. Think of it as payment for one of 
those appetizing flowers."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Bunet] 
I will begin gathering ingredients. Please, give 
me some time to prepare."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alfred] 
If it fixes my muscle problem, you can take 
all the time you need!"
