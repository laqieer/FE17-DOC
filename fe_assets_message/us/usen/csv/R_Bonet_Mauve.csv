[Mauvier] 
Heh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Bunet] 
Mauvier, I have some presents for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
Are these vegetables from your garden?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Bunet] 
Yes. Appetizing, aren't they? They're for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Mauvier] 
Bunet. I told you I do not want to treat myself. 
Not while others suffer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Bunet] 
That's too bad. I suppose these vegetables will 
just rot, then."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Bunet] 
Such a shame. I worked so hard to grow them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Mauvier] 
Why do you pay so much attention to me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Bunet] 
Hm. I suppose you remind me of the plants 
from my garden. I want to help you grow."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Bunet] 
That scrumptious, fragrant goodness inside has 
to be nurtured so it doesn't wither away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Mauvier] 
Heh... You are trying to make me feel better 
about my lot in life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Mauvier] 
Do you truly believe I can grow, and not just 
rot away?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Bunet] 
Hm... I don't think I can answer that for you. 
You have to decide for yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Bunet] 
In the meantime, seriously, eat these vegetables."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Mauvier] 
Yes. Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Bunet] 
You can grill them if you like, but they'll really 
shine if you let me cook them up for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Mauvier] 
Thank you, Bunet."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Mauvier] 
I shall continue looking for a way to grow so as 
to not rot away. For you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1

[Mauvier] 
What is this flower called? It has a wonderful 
scent."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Bunet] 
Ah, that's jasmine. One of the most aromatic 
flowers I grow."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Mauvier] 
Your garden is quite lovely. I admit, I have found 
excuses to visit lately."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Bunet] 
It really means that much to you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Bunet] 
I'll harvest some vegetables and cook up a nice 
ratatouille. The taste will move you, I promise."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Mauvier] 
There's no need for you to go to such lengths."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Mauvier] 
Simply taking time to pause here occasionally 
is more than enough for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Bunet] 
Everyone needs a little downtime. And they can 
always use a good meal too."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Mauvier] 
I was one of the Four Hounds."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Mauvier] 
So now I work to protect the weak, as an act of 
atonement for my past actions."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Mauvier] 
People suffer daily. I fail them by allowing 
myself any pleasure, no matter how simple."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Bunet] 
Don't think like that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Mauvier] 
I am sorry. It may be some time until I visit this 
garden again. If ever."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Bunet] 
Well, well. You're branching nicely. I'm sure you 
will be delicious one day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Bunet] 
In the meantime, I'll water you plenty so you 
grow big and healthy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Oh, is this your garden?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Bunet] 
Mauvier, what are you doing here?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Mauvier] 
Keeping guard. What manner of vegetables are 
you growing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Bunet] 
I plant a variety this time of year, though most 
won't grow until later."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Bunet] 
Nothing is better than homegrown produce. 
Cook it just a bit and you have a masterpiece."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Mauvier] 
You are also raising flowers. Are they for 
cooking as well?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Bunet] 
Oh, no. These flowers are just for looking at. 
And smelling."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Bunet] 
The scent of fresh flowers has a way of easing 
the soul. Here, sniff."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Mauvier] 
Huh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Mauvier] 
What a lovely fragrance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Mauvier] 
You are correct. It is quite calming."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Bunet] 
You've been working too hard. Why not drop by 
here to relax now and then?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Mauvier] 
That sounds...nice."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Mauvier] 
Yes. I believe I will come by from time to time."
