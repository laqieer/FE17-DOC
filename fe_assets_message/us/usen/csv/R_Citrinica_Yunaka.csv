[Citrinne] 
All right, Yunaka. We're alone. Finish your story."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Yunaka] 
All right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
The girl does as she's told─as she's trained to 
do. Killing is just a job to her. Not personal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
Until one day, when the assassin who raised her 
falls ill."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Yunaka] 
His disease is incurable. He has little time left."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Yunaka] 
So he tells the girl the real reason he took her in 
was to set her up to succeed him."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Yunaka] 
And then, offering all the money they'd earned 
together as payment, he gives her one last job."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Citrinne] 
No..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Yunaka] 
She feels mostly scorn for him. But she also 
knows that, without him, she wouldn't be alive."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Yunaka] 
So she honors his last wish. She puts him down."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Citrinne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Yunaka] 
After that, Larimar gives up murder for hire. 
Tries to move on with her life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Yunaka] 
She changes her name to Yunaka, and that's it. 
Here she is. Being someone new."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Citrinne] 
I see..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Yunaka] 
Now, about the meeting with the Brodian brass."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Right. I'm still suspicious of your intentions."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Yunaka] 
I was laying the groundwork for a project."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Citrinne] 
What kind of project?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Yunaka] 
Truth is, I've been wanting to set up a fund to 
help underprivileged kids."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Yunaka] 
That meeting was going to be the start. I was 
planning to propose the idea there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Citrinne] 
Oh!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Citrinne] 
So that's why you've been asking so many 
people about the Brodian assembly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Yunaka] 
Exactly. My goal is to do all I can to make sure 
no kid has to go through what I went through."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Citrinne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Citrinne] 
I've been a vicious fool."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Yunaka] 
What? No way. You were right to be suspicious. 
That didn't bug me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Citrinne] 
Yunaka, please allow me to help you establish 
that fund. Consider it the start of my apology."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Yunaka] 
Wait, really?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Citrinne] 
As this war rages on, the number of children 
who have lost parents grows and grows."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Citrinne] 
Brodia's heart is breaking. Many of our nobles 
have been searching for ways to help."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Citrinne] 
Please, let me share my connections. I acted in 
bad faith...and I must atone for that mistake."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Yunaka] 
No, no! You've got nothing to atone for. 
Seriously, I'm nothing but grateful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Citrinne] 
I'm relieved to hear that..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Citrinne] 
You're trying to do a wonderful thing here. 
I will ensure that you find success."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#035,"[Citrinne] 
You and I have a long working relationship 
ahead of us. I look forward to it!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#036,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah, we do! And I promise you, I'll never 
forget this kindness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 

[Citrinne] 
All right, Yunaka. I'll listen to what you have to 
say, but if a single lie slips through your lips..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
I'll start from the beginning. And I won't lie."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Yunaka] 
The girl in this story isn't named Yunaka. 
She's called Larimar."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Yunaka] 
She's born to a poor family living in a town on 
the Brodian bluffs. Her parents abandon her."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Yunaka] 
She isn't even old enough to understand why. 
But then a man takes her in...an assassin."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Citrinne] 
Oh!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Yunaka] 
He tells her he wants a little helper."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Yunaka] 
So he trains the girl to kill."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Citrinne] 
To what end?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Yunaka] 
Easy money."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Citrinne] 
So this man foisted his profession onto you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Yunaka] 
Correct."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Citrinne] 
And that's how you became an assassin..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Citrinne] 
There is tragedy to your tale, but you've earned 
no sympathy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Yunaka] 
I'm not asking for sympathy. And I'm not done."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Fine. Continue your story."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Yunaka] 
Wait─someone's coming."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Citrinne] 
Is that a problem?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Yunaka] 
We'll have to finish this another time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Citrinne] 
Very well."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Yunaka. Tell me what you have planned for the 
upcoming Brodian assembly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Sorry, could you try again? Only one of my ears 
was ready that time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Citrinne] 
I know you've been asking around for details on 
the upcoming gathering of Brodian officials."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Yunaka] 
Uh...what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Citrinne] 
Brodia is my treasure, as are its people. If you 
have any criminal intentions, I will stop you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Yunaka] 
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up. Back it up. I-I think 
this might be a misunderstanding."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Oh? What exactly am I ""misunderstanding""? 
You are lying about your identity, are you not?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Yunaka] 
That's, uh... Well, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Citrinne] 
Don't bother denying it. You've fooled many, 
but I know your true profession."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Citrinne] 
You're an assassin."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Citrinne] 
I assume you didn't consider someone like me 
to be a threat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Citrinne] 
As a noble it's my duty to keep my people safe, 
and I can tell that you're up to something."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Citrinne] 
I've already gathered all the evidence I need. If 
you don't confess, I'll tell everyone about you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah. It's true. I was a Brodian assassin."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Yunaka] 
Honestly, though, I've put that life behind me. 
That's not who I am anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Citrinne] 
Try harder."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Yunaka] 
I'm telling you the truth. Look, hear me out 
at least. Please─I'll tell you everything."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Citrinne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Citrinne] 
Fine. I'll hear what you have to say...but later."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Citrinne] 
Know this, Yunaka...to protect Brodia, I can and 
will act with a heart of cold steel. No mercy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah. I'll remember."
