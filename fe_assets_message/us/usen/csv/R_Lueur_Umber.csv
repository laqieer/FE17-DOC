MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
Don't tell me... Was that, ""I'm sad, and I wish 
I could see you all again""?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Amber] 
D-Divine One?! When did you get here? 
How did you know what I was saying?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
I've heard you chatting with them a lot. I guess 
I'm picking up some of the language."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Amber] 
For real?! Whoa."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
Whoa!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Amber] 
Yeah! Whoa! Wait, what was your whoa for?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
You didn't hear that just now? It sounded like 
the far-off cry of a real alpaca!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Amber] 
Aww, I missed it! What did they say?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
I can't believe I'm saying this, but...I think they 
said, ""We'll visit when we have a free weekend."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Amber] 
Really?! Aww! Those lovable furballs! I need to 
reply! Let me think..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alear] 
""Don't worry, friends. You're welcome to visit 
at any time..."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
""But the Divine One is here, so I'm doing OK. 
Take care of yourselves."" Did I get that right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Amber] 
Yeah! That's exactly what I said!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Amber] 
Incredible. It's like you're a native speaker! 
You really have the ears of an alpaca."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
I'm honored to hear that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Amber] 
This is great. Spending time with you makes me 
feel like I'm right back on the ranch."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
Oh? So I remind you of a farm animal?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Amber] 
Huh? No! That's not what I meant! Sorry, that 
came out wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alear] 
It's OK, Amber. I'm glad you feel that way. 
I don't want a friend like you to feel lonely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Amber] 
Whoa! Such intense kindness! Thanks, DD. 
You're the best."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Amber] 
Hmm... Let me guess. ""You're welcome""?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Alear] 
You got it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Amber] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
Hello, Amber. Were you talking to the alpacas 
back home again?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Amber] 
Hey, Divine One! I sure was."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
May I ask what you said to them just now?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Amber] 
Oh. I said, ""How's it going, fellas?"""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
That's how you say that? Er, in the language 
of the alpacas?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Amber] 
Totally. If I'd asked that back on the ranch, 
they'd have answered right away."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
Really?! That's pretty cute!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Amber] 
Yeah! It is! It's super cute!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Amber] 
I never imagined I'd end up shouting back to 
them from so far away."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Amber] 
Truth is, I didn't like my hometown very much. 
Middle of nowhere, nothing cool for miles..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Amber] 
All I could think about was getting out of there. 
""Someday I'll leave this sty and become a hero!"""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Amber] 
Now that I've become a retainer, I've started to 
miss home a lot more. I get kinda lonely..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Amber] 
Aw, shoot. Sorry. I didn't mean to whine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
It's OK. I'm here to listen. If you're lonely, I can 
stay with you for a while."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I just hope I can be as fun to talk to as your 
alpaca friends back home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Amber] 
Are you kidding? I'd love to keep talking!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Amber] 
I can even teach you some more of the alpaca 
language if you want."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alear] 
Sounds like fun."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Amber] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Amber] 
Oh. Hey, Divine One!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
Good evening, Amber. Did you hear those weird 
sounds just now? Was that you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Amber] 
Sure was. I was calling out to my old alpaca 
friends back in my hometown."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
Say again?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Amber] 
My hometown is a quaint little alpaca hamlet. 
I grew up surrounded by them!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Amber] 
Sometimes I get a little homesick and miss 
my fuzzy friends on the ranch..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Amber] 
On my loneliest nights, I come out here, look up 
at the starry sky, and call to them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
Ooh, so that's what that sound was..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Amber] 
Those were the cries of an alpaca! I'm calling 
out to them in their language."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
Their...language?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Amber] 
I know. I know. It sounds crazy. There's no way 
they can hear me from so far away..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Amber] 
But this is how I get the sads out! When I call to 
them, it feels like they're right by my side."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
I don't think that's crazy. I'm sure your feelings 
are getting back to them somehow, Amber."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Amber] 
Aw! Thanks, Divine One. You're so nice!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Amber] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Amber] 
Here's my hometown...aaand this one is of my 
family's alpaca ranch back home..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Amber] 
You can probably guess this next one. 
Here's a hint: it's an alpaca!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
I never knew you were so good at drawing, 
Amber. These illustrations are amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Amber] 
Aw, thanks!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
Looking through these is making me feel a 
little jealous."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
It's clear you love and miss your hometown. 
I can't even remember where my home is..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Amber] 
Divine One..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Amber] 
Your home is right here."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
What? Right where?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Amber] 
Right here beside me!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
Huh?!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Amber] 
Listen, Divine One! If you're a legendary sword, 
I'll be the legendary sheath that protects you!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Amber] 
If a battle leaves you dinged and scratched, I'll 
do everything I can to cover and heal you!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Amber] 
And I'll always carry you back home...safe and 
sound, a thousand times over."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
Amber..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
No. That won't do. I'm happy you feel this way, 
but I..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Amber] 
Y-you're right, Divine One. Sorry. That was way 
out of line, huh? Aw, man..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
No! That's not what I meant. If I'm a sword, 
then so are you. We're fighting together!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Amber] 
Whoa..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
You dream of being a legendary hero, right? 
Well, I want to help you realize that dream!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Amber] 
Divine One, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
I want you to wear the Pact Ring, Amber. 
Will you do that for me?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
All I need is a promise that you'll be a sword by 
my side."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Amber] 
Yeah! I mean, yes! If that's your condition, 
then count me in!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
Let's build a peaceful world together, Amber."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
And then, someday...I want to visit your alpaca 
ranch back home."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Amber] 
Of course! My hometown is your hometown."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Amber] 
Thank you, Divine One. I'm so overwhelmed 
right now. I don't know what to say..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Amber] 
Oh! I should let the alpacas back home know 
about this! They'll be thrilled!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Amber] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033,"[Alear] 
Uh... That sounds like it might take a while. 
Save it for later! I want to be part of that too."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034,"[Alear] 
Besides, I'd rather have you present in this 
moment for just a bit longer, you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035,"[Amber] 
Oh! Sure thing, Divine Dragon !"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#036,"[Amber] 
We're twin blades now, bound together forever! 
Even if you regret it later! Which you won't!"
