[Vander] 
All right, Framme. What is it this time?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Vander] 
I presume there has been some trouble with the 
task I assigned you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Framme] 
Wrong! Hehe, I'll take care of that in a sec."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Vander] 
Well, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Framme] 
Here. This is for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Framme] 
It's my way of thanking you for, y'know, 
expecting the best of me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Vander] 
What is this? A pack of...""Frickets""?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Framme] 
Yup! Short for Framme Tickets. Think of 'em as 
a big sorry for all the grief I've caused you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Framme] 
If you're ever feeling tired, or there's a chore 
you don't wanna do, or whatever...use a Fricket!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Framme] 
Day or night, no matter what it is, I'll zip right 
over and help you out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Vander] 
Framme..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Vander] 
While I have no children of my own..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Vander] 
I imagine this is how it feels to be a 
proud parent."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Vander] 
Thank you. I will be sure to use these Frickets 
sparingly. They are quite precious, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Framme] 
Hehe, you got that right! As for me, I'll keep 
trying my best to make you proud."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Framme] 
I'm gonna make mistakes sometimes, but with 
your help, I know I can get better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Framme] 
So keep teaching me to be the very best 
steward I can be!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Vander] 
Of course. Though you appear to be well on 
your way already."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Framme] 2 
[Framme] 
Uh... Oh no. Oh no!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Framme] 
I forgot where I'm supposed to take 
this package."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Framme] 
Ugh... Vander's gonna kill me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Vander] 
Hello, Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Framme] 
AH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Framme] 
Vander, hey! So I was on my way to deliver that 
package like you asked, and, um..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Framme] 
I messed up. Again. You can go ahead and yell 
at me now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Vander] 
Grant me the patience... No matter. It wasn't 
terribly urgent."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Framme] 
You're...you're not mad?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Vander] 
Why should I be? You admitted your error 
and apologized."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Framme] 
But I promised to stop messing things up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Vander] 
Growth takes time. The Somniel wasn't built 
in a day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Framme] 
That's true..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Vander] 
Try breaking tasks into pieces and going 
through them step by step. That works for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Framme] 
OK! Next time, I'll get it right for sure. You're 
gonna be so proud!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Framme] 2 

[Vander] 
FRAMME!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Framme] 
Ahh!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Vander] 
Why are you loafing about? I told you to sort 
through the offerings."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Framme] 
Oops! I completely forgot."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Vander] 
Grant me the patience... How do you manage 
to bungle even the smallest task?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Vander] 
This is exactly why I fear for your future."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Framme] 
I meant to do it, honest. It just kinda...slipped 
my mind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Vander] 
You know I will not credit that excuse. 
Forgetting is the same as doing nothing at all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Vander] 
Imagine how disappointed your parents would 
be if they found out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Framme] 
Aw..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Vander] 
Framme, I have high expectations for you and 
your brother. You are my successors, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Vander] 
For my peace of mind, and to honor the mother 
and father who left you in my care...do better."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Framme] 
Yes, sir!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Framme] 
This is the last time I let you down, 
Vander. Promise!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Vander] 
Very good."
