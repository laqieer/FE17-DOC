MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,Morning!
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,You look nice today.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,What? I'm being especially kind?
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004,"Huh. That means I'm well on my way to being 
truly charming, doesn't it?"
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,A charming princess is here to wake you up.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,You're awake already?
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,"You could've slept a bit longer, you know. 
I'm early."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,"Sorry about that, Divine One."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,I got up bright and early today...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,and I came straight to you.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,"I guess I couldn't wait to see you, Divine One."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,I seem extra sophisticated today?
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,"If I am, it's thanks to you."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004,I'll never forget what you taught me.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,"Sorry to disturb you, Divine One."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,Morning. What's that look all about?
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,Glad you noticed. I'm practicing being dignified.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,"A princess should carry herself with a regal 
bearing, after all."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,I know better than to barge in here noisily.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,"That's not what my mother would do, is it?"
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,"She knew that real charm is being kind to 
other people."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,Phew! You're awake.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,I'm so relieved.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,Don't worry me like that!
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004,You need to take up snoring!
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#005,"You know, for my sake!"
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,"Elusia's most charming princess is here to 
wake you!"
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,"OK, this is gonna be tough."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,"Wait, you're already up?!"
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,I was ready for you to put up a real struggle!
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004,"Well, whatever. Good morning!"
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,Wow. You're a heavy sleeper.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,You don't snore at all either. Amazing.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,"Hang on... You're still breathing, right?"
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004,"Uh, Divine One? Hey, are you alive?!"
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,"Ah, you're up. Feeling rested?"
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,I want you to know I'm grateful for your advice.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,"I'm trying to think about other people first 
instead of putting on a show."
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,"Right, time to practice being kind. Here we go."
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,I usually barge in here...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,but today I'll be more gentle.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,"Aw, you're already awake?!"
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004,"How am I supposed to be considerate now? 
You ruined it!"
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,"You always work so hard for the rest of us, 
Divine One."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,"It's good to see you getting some rest. 
You've earned it."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,"Look at me─coming in to wake you and 
then telling you to sleep..."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,Rise and shine!
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,"Whoa, what?"
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,You don't look disheveled at all!
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004,You just roll out of bed perfect?!
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#005,I need to reevaluate my life...
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#006,I'm gonna go.
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,Prepare to be awakened adorably!
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,Morning!
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,"Does the power of my cuteness have you 
brimming with energy?"
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003,I'm happy to be of service!
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Still hiding in bed, huh?"
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,"Haha, or maybe you're embarrassed to be seen 
all disheveled."
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,"It's OK. I'm a complete mess first thing in the 
morning too."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,"Morning, Divine One."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,What? I look gloomy?
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,"At least use a classy word─like ""melancholy."""
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004,"You're right, though. I've had a lot on my 
mind recently."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#005,"But don't worry. I'll still be there when you 
need me."
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,This room kinda makes me nervous...
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,Ah! You're awake! Uh...
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,Would you rather I not come in?
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,"Sorry, I'll go."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,I don't know if this is OK.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,My whole country worships the Fell Dragon.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,"I wonder what Father would say if he saw me 
in this place."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004,And Ivy too...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,"Morning, Divine One!"
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,Before you step out into the big scary world...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,let's hang out here for a bit.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004,"Risking our lives can wait, can't it?"
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,Your most charming friend is here to wake you!
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,You woke up fast!
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,I was all set to wake you gently too.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,"Oh well. You're a better conversationalist when 
you're conscious anyway."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004,"Good morning, Divine One."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,Moments like this are nice.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,"Just you and me, y'know?"
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,We're both something special.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,So obviously we make a good pair.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,"But times like this remind me just how well we 
complement each other."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,"I know you'll always support me, no 
matter what."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007,I'll do the same for you.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Ah! I didn't realize you were awake!
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,Were you only pretending to be asleep?!
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,Hm. It's OK. I don't mind if you heard all that.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,It's the truth.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,"It's me, Divine One."
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002,"Your favorite princess, Hortensia!"
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,"Morning! Already up, I see."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,"I told you I'd always make time for you, 
so here I am."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,"I don't check in on all my friends like this, 
you know."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,So you don't need to feel jealous.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,Strange...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,"I just remembered we were enemies when we 
first met."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,I'd almost forgotten.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,"That time feels so far away that I don't think 
about it much."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,I was such a fool back then. So naive...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,Not to mention totally full of myself.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007,Thank you for guiding me.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#008,I'm a much better person now because of it.
