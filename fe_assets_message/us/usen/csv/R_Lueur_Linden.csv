[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
My, but you're a quick study, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
I have a good teacher."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Lindon] 
Ha ha. Cheap flattery won't win me over."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Lindon] 
Ahh, but I never thought I'd live to see this day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Lindon] 
A former royal knight of Elusia sitting with the 
Divine Dragon for a chat."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Lindon] 
If I could somehow go back and tell my younger 
self about it, I don't think I'd believe me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Lindon] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
Something on your mind?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Lindon] 
Just a request of the Divine Dragon from 
someone who has been around a while."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Lindon] 
Stay alive. No matter what foulness you see in 
this life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
Lindon?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Lindon] 
Among my many days were some so trying that 
I was tempted to give up and die."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Lindon] 
But something always came along afterward 
that made me glad I lived to see it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Lindon] 
My friendship with you, Divine One, rates high 
among those happy occasions."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
I'm touched that you'd say so."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Lindon] 
Push hard through those bleakest of nights 
toward the dawn where things seem brighter."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Lindon] 
If there's one bit of wisdom I'd want today's 
youth to heed from me, it's that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
I'll take it to heart."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
Although I should mention, Lindon..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
You talk a lot about how long-lived you are, 
but you realize I'm actually far older, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Lindon] 
Hahaha! I suppose you are, at that!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Lindon] 
You see? Every day's a surprise! Hahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Alear] 
I keep thinking back to what you were saying 
about sleep, Lindon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Lindon] 
Ah, greetings, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
I'm still a firm no on that experiment, but I do 
want to talk about it with you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Lindon] 
Are you sure you want to waste your time 
visiting this old codger?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Lindon] 
There are so many others you could talk to 
who'd have a real impact on your life."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
What's gotten into you? Is this because you 
got a talking-to from Vander?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Lindon] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
He wasn't happy to hear you might have burned 
my hair off."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Lindon] 
Er... Well, no use dredging up the distant past, 
I always say."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
I know it won't happen again. So let's put it 
behind us and talk about sleep."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Lindon] 
I'm relieved to hear you don't hold a grudge, 
but even so, I don't know how much use I'll be."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Lindon] 
Find a more practical and efficient use of your 
time, or you'll regret it down the road."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
Well, I'd hate to waste any time, it's true."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
I of all people know how fleeting it can be."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Lindon] 
Well said. Now then..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
All the more reason why we should sit and have 
this talk without delay, Lindon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
There's a lot I want to ask, and any more back- 
and-forth would be impractical and inefficient."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Lindon] 
Well─ But on the other hand─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Lindon] 
Hmph. Too smart for your own good, I say!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Lindon] 
But have it your way. Whatever wisdom I've got 
is at your disposal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
Are you ready to begin, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
I think so, Lindon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
But I do want to double-check one last thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
This experiment will somehow result in making 
people's lives easier and happier, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Lindon] 
Absolutely, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Lindon] 
What I learn by examining you is certain to lead 
to a new discovery or three."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Lindon] 
I anticipate very interesting results relating to 
quality sleep."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
Quality...sleep?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Lindon] 
You dozed for one thousand years, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Lindon] 
It's fair to say no one has ever slept more 
soundly than you. Maybe we'll find out why."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
Do you really think that's likely?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Lindon] 
I most certainly do! This could be a godsend 
for those who struggle with insomnia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
I hadn't thought of that. All right, sure. I'd love 
to help with your experiment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Lindon] 
I greatly appreciate it, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Lindon] 
The first step is to cast Thunder on you a few 
times to see how your body reacts."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Lindon] 
You'll grow numb to the pain soon enough, but 
your hair may not survive the experience."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
You know, I've changed my mind. Sorry, but 
you'll have to find another test subject."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Lindon] 2 

[Lindon] 
So this is the Pact Ring. I can tell already that 
there's great power bound up in it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Lindon] 
You don't mind if I experiment with it a bit, hm? 
First, I'll test its reaction to Thunder..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
Wait, stop! That ring is very important."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Lindon] 
Hahaha, just winding you up, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Lindon] 
So, is there some reason you're showing me 
this ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
I was hoping you'd wear it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Lindon] 
Hm. I suppose I could, but why?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Alear] 
As a sign of our partnership."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Lindon] 
Um...pardon?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Lindon] 
What's gotten into you?! Why would you want 
a partnership with me, of all people?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Lindon] 
I thought you were bright, but you're proving 
yourself an utter fool!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Lindon] 
I'm far too old to enter into something new with 
anyone now."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
I beg to differ. We work well together. This ring 
is a sign of the partnership we already have."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
We're stronger together. I want to seal that 
bond in the hopes of saving the world."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Lindon] 
It has to be me, eh? There's no one younger? 
I only have so many years left."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Lindon] 
You do this, and you'll end up feeling like I did 
the day I lost my wife."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Lindon] 
Nothing but sorrow for you lies down that road."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
Right now matters more to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
You're alive now. I draw inspiration and 
strength from you now."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
Besides, even if I choose someone younger, I'm 
a dragon. I'd outlive any of them anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Lindon] 
Hm..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
Do you really think I'm a fool to ask this of you?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Lindon] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Lindon] 
No, you aren't. If one of us is being foolish 
here, it's me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Lindon] 
You came to me in need, and I brushed you 
off without a second thought."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Lindon] 
Give me the ring, and I'll give you whatever I've 
got left."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
I appreciate that. Really and truly."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Lindon] 
Ah, listen to me! I sound so ungrateful."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Lindon] 
Thank you for this gift, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Lindon] 
I'll make sure that it's worth your while. Now, 
shall we go save the world?"
