These plains, the green land, the wind...they 
raised me to be strong. And you?"
MID_BT1_#002,"[Alear] t 
[Lyn] 
Relax 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
I'm still improving, but I have gained strength 
during our journey."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Lyn] 
I'm glad to hear you're feeling stronger, but I 
won't be holding back!"
MID_BT2_#001,"[Ivy] t 
[Ivy] Pain 

[Ivy] 
It feels a little strange to fight you. I'm reminded 
of my father and all that happened."
MID_BT2_#002,"[Lyn] b 
[Lyn] 
Relax 
[Lyn] 
Oh? I'm rather happy about this fight myself. 
Facing someone as skilled as you is a pleasure."
MID_BT2_#003,"[Ivy] Sad 

[Ivy] 
If only he had been so encouraging. Very well, 
let's begin."

[Hortensia] 
Seeing you makes me feel like I might see my 
father again. Too bad that's not how it works."

[Lyn] Status 
[Lyn] 
Unfortunately, I'm neither a substitute for your 
father nor his memory."
MID_BT3_#003,"[Lyn] 
Smile 
[Lyn] 
Still, I can see you've become quite talented. 
So show me just how much you've grown!"
MID_BT3_#004,"[Hortensia] StandBy 
[Hortensia] 
I am refined in strength and charm! If my father 
were here, he'd be in awe of what I've become!"

[Lyn] 
Wow. You beat me soundly. You're very strong."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Alear] 
And you were as skilled as I expected! Very 
powerful too..."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alear] 
I wonder if I could be like you? If I grew up on 
the plains, I mean."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Lyn] 
Haha, perhaps. I learned to fight out here, but 
I learned more when I met Eliwood and Hector."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Lyn] 
We traveled long and far together. Sometimes, 
we'd compete with one another, just like this."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Lyn] 
They helped me to learn of justice and courage. 
And they gave me the strength to trust others."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Lyn] 
And that strength has made me who I am today."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Alear] 
When I woke, I had no memories and no one 
I felt I could rely on."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Alear] 
But now I have so many friends around me to 
teach me about the world...and about myself."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
I hope that, at the end of my journey, I'll be as 
strong as them. And you."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Lyn] 
You'll definitely become much stronger! 
I'm sure of it!"
MID_ED1_#012,"[Lyn] 
Of course, I'll help too!"
MID_ED1_#013,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Lyn."
MID_EV1_#001,"[Lyn] b 
[Lyn] 
Relax 
[Lyn] 
Are you ready? Then come at me! Attack with 
everything you've got!"
MID_EV2_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] 
Angry 

[Alear] 
I can hear the voices of enemy forces in those 
tents. We should attack them, quickly."
MID_EV3_#001,"[Lyn] b 
[Lyn] 
Relax 
[Lyn] 
I'm not going to just stand around! I'll have at 
them too!"

[Lyn] 
Ah, the breeze...the smell... So much like home."
MID_OP1_#002,"[Alear] 
Home? Do you mean the world you're from?"
MID_OP1_#003,"[Lyn] 
Yes. This place is just like the Sacae Plains. 
That's where I was born."
MID_OP1_#004,"[Lyn] 
Ahh, I remember their beauty well. When I was 
young, those plains seemed to stretch forever."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Alear] 
It truly is wonderful scenery, and the wind is 
so pleasant."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Lyn] 
It makes me happy to hear you say that, even if 
this is not my true homeland."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Lyn] 
We woke at dawn and tended to our cattle, 
caught game, and slept when the sun set."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Lyn] 
That was every day of my life, growing up on 
the plains. But it didn't last forever."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Alear] 
Can you tell me what happened?"
MID_OP1_#010,"[Lyn] 
The Lorca tribe, my people, were attacked by 
vicious bandits... They killed so many of us."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Lyn] 
The bandits were cowardly. They poisoned our 
drinking water, then attacked in the chaos."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Alear] 
That's terrible..."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Lyn] 
Yes, but the Sacae Plains are our motherland, 
and have always blessed us with their bounty."
MID_OP1_#014,"[Lyn] 
It is a place I love deeply, though it holds many 
painful memories."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Lyn] 
Enough mourning! The sense of this place is 
exciting me!"
MID_OP1_#016,"[Lyn] 
Ready your sword! I'll show you the true skill 
of a Lorca tribe warrior!"
MID_OP1_#017,"[Alear] 
I can't wait. You won't beat me easily, though."
MID_OP1_#018,"[Alear] 
I've overcome so many hardships in my life. 
And more will come, I'm sure."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Lyn] 
But our bond will grow stronger with this fight, 
as will my power."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Lyn] 
So whatever you do, don't hold back!"
