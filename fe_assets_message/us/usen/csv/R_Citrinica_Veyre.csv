[Citrinne] 
Lady Veyle? May I have a moment?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
I suppose."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
I need you to know...I only wanted to be friends 
with you. Truly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Citrinne] 
But it seems as if my actions have made a mess 
of things. I apologize for that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Veyle] 
Before I accept your apology, I have to 
ask something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Veyle] 
What did you mean when you said you wanted 
me to accept the gifts for your sake?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Citrinne] 
I just wanted to see my favorite thing..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Citrinne] 
The smile on a friend's face."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Veyle] 
You...wanted to see me smile?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Citrinne] 
Yes. That's why I asked you to accept them for 
my sake."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Veyle] 
The dress, the island, the crown...they weren't 
offerings? They were gifts...for me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Citrinne] 
I promise. I meant them as gifts, that's all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Citrinne] 
I thought it might make you smile to receive 
presents worthy of a princess."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Veyle] 
I'm so sorry, Citrinne. I completely 
misunderstood your intentions."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Veyle] 
I hope it's not too late..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Citrinne] 
No, not at all! I still have the deed to that island. 
Let me just─"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Veyle] 
Oh, no! That's not what I meant! I don't need 
expensive presents."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Veyle] 
I meant, I hope it's not too late to be friends. 
I hope maybe we could start...now?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Citrinne] 
Of course..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Citrinne] 
Of course we can, Lady Veyle!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Citrinne] 
I already consider you to be one of my most 
precious friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Veyle] 
Hehe, that makes me so happy, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Veyle] 
Your friendship really is the most wonderful 
gift you could ever give me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
I can't believe how many rare gems have been 
stitched into this dress. It's so sparkly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Are you pleased with your new attire, 
Lady Veyle?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Veyle] 
MY attire? Oh, I can't possibly keep this. 
It's way too valuable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Oh? Really? I was sure it would suit you..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Veyle] 
And why did you hand me this deed saying I 
own ""a deserted island with beautiful beaches""?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Citrinne] 
It also says, ""private villa included."" A pretty 
dress deserves a pretty escape, don't you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Veyle] 
I suppose... But I can't accept a deserted island 
or a gem-covered dress."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Citrinne] 
Perhaps just this crown then? I had it custom 
made for you, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Veyle] 
Oh, it's so beautiful!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Veyle] 
Wait, no! I can't! I don't need this!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Citrinne] 
But... But... Oh, won't you please accept just 
one of these things?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Citrinne] 
For my sake?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Veyle] 
For your sake? What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Veyle] 
Oh."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Veyle] 
I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Veyle] 
This isn't a gift─it's an offering."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Veyle] 
It's like when the worshippers from Elusia kept 
giving me all those fancy offerings..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Veyle] 
Hoping their wishes and prayers would 
be granted."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Citrinne] 
Really? Oh my."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Veyle] 
Well, I won't accept anything from you, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Veyle] 
It's unfortunate, really."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Veyle] 
All I wanted was for us to be friends."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Veyle] 

[Citrinne] 
Oh, dear... Lady Veyle..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Veyle] 
Oh, um, why are you looking at me like that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Citrinne] 
I'm just so curious..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Veyle] 
Curious? About what?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Citrinne] 
It's so...modest."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Veyle] 
I... I don't understand."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Citrinne] 
You're a princess, yet there isn't a single bit of 
jewelry or finery on you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Citrinne] 
Your outfit is just so...modest!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Veyle] 
What does it matter to you? It just... It wasn't 
my fate to have lots of fancy things, I guess."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Citrinne] 
Of course. I understand."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Citrinne] 
And yet─oh, how shall I put this... I feel a deep 
need to coax your inner royal out from hiding."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
I'm sorry if my...plainness...bothers you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Citrinne] 
Oh my. I apologize, Lady Veyle. I hope you 
know that I meant no offense."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Citrinne] 
Just rest easy and leave everything to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Veyle] 
Leave everything... Wait, what do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Citrinne] 
Let's see... I suppose it would be wise to start 
with the base garments."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, but a person's style is directly influenced 
by their lifestyle, so perhaps... Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Citrinne] 

[Veyle] 
What does that mean? Aw, I'm not sure I want 
to find out."
