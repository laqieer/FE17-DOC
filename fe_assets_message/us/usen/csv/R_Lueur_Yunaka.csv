[Alear] 
What would you like to talk about 
today, Yunaka?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Yunaka] 
This isn't easy for me, but I want you to know 
why I've had a hard time telling the truth."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
So I'm just going to lay it all out there, OK? 
The truth is, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
The truth is, I... I used to be..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
It's all right. You don't have to tell me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Yunaka] 
But I..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
I can see how hard this is for you. It's obvious 
just looking at your face."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
I told you before that I won't pry. It really is as 
simple as that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Yunaka] 
You're really OK with me keeping a secret from 
you like this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
Of course. I have secrets too, you know. There's 
no need to make yourself uncomfortable."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
I only want to hear what you are ready to 
tell me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Yunaka] 
Thank you. Sincerely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Yunaka] 
What I'm ready to say is that I'm truly grateful 
to have a friend like you in my life."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Yunaka] 
I feel like I've finally found that place in the 
world I was looking for, you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Yunaka] 
That's entirely thanks to you, and I won't forget 
it. I'm glad to fight for you and all our friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
I really appreciate that, Yunaka."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Yunaka] 
I'll tell you all I can about my past, but I think 
the present is what matters. Us, here and now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Yunaka] 
We're just getting to know each other. There's 
so much more to say! It's like an adventure."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
An adventure. I like that. I look forward to 
continuing this journey with you, Yunaka."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 
[Yunaka] 
What can this humble liar do for you, 
Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
I'd like to have a talk, that's all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Yunaka] 
I understand. And I'm prepared to accept 
whatever punishment you have in mind."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
Punishment? No. I wanted you to know how 
grateful I've been to have you by my side."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Yunaka] 
Wait, what?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
That's how I feel."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
You fight hard every day to protect our allies. 
There's absolutely no reason to punish you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
In hindsight, I think the only reason you lied is 
that we don't know each other very well yet."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
So, let's change that. Why don't you start by 
telling me something about yourself, Yunaka?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Yunaka] 
Heh... Way to put me on the spot."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
If you don't want to, then I won't pry. 
Simple as that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Yunaka] 
OK..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Yunaka] 
Before I joined up with you, I was sort of just... 
wandering. Looking for my place in the world."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Yunaka] 
I'd left my old self behind me. Wanted to think 
I had, at least."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
You don't sound very fond of your old self."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Yunaka] 
Oh, I like her well enough. Others, though, 
not so much. That's why she had to go."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Yunaka] 
But I like who I am now, and honestly, I've 
been having so much fun since we met!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
Haha, I'm glad to hear that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alear] 
Good talk, Yunaka. I think we should do it again 
sometime. What do you say?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Yunaka] 
You got yourself a deal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 

[Alear] 
Impressive work out there today, Yunaka."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Whoa, what? I got praise from the Divine One?! 
Zappy! I'm thrilled! Beyond thrilled!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
I'm serious. Skills like yours are in high demand. 
You must have been a mercenary or something."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Yunaka] 
Right, um...mercenary! Yeah! You could tell? 
I mean..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Yunaka] 
Obviously I've merc'd a time or two. 
No big deal."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alear] 
I thought so. With strength like yours, you must 
be pretty well-known too."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Yunaka] 
Uh, sure?! I mean, yup! People, ah... 
People know me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
I'll bet some of our allies are well acquainted 
with your reputation already."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
I'll have to ask around. There must be stories."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Yunaka] 
Aah! No! I mean... Could I ask you to maybe... 
not do that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
What? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Yunaka] 
Because I lied. Again."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Yunaka] 
I've never been a mercenary. You said it, and it 
sounded nice, so I went with it... I'm sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
I'm confused."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Yunaka] 
You asked me about my past. I panicked. 
And just like always, I hid behind a lie."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Yunaka] 
I'm truly sorry, Divine One. I should not have 
deceived you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Yunaka] 
You were only trying to praise me, and I just 
had to go and ruin it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Yunaka] 
I'll take my leave."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alear] 
Yunaka..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 
[Yunaka] 
OK, Divine One. It's time for me to come clean."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Yunaka] 
I know you said you wouldn't pry, and you only 
want to hear what I'm ready to say."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Yunaka] 
But I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna get, and 
you have a right to know."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
If you're sure this is what you want, I'm here 
to listen."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Yunaka] 
OK... Here goes."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Yunaka] 
My name used to be Larimar. I changed it to get 
away from my old life...as an assassin."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
Go on."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Yunaka] 
I was never too attached to Larimar...or to her 
parents, who left her when she was young."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Yunaka] 
She is my past, though. In that sense, 
she'll always be a part of me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Yunaka] 
Which means, even though I've moved on, you 
can't know the real me without her."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
It was brave of you to tell me all that."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
I do want to know the real you. The value of 
this conversation is not lost on me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Yunaka] 
I appreciate that. Thank you, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
Of course."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
Since you trusted me with your secret, Yunaka, 
I guess I'd better tell you mine."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Yunaka] 
I didn't even know you had one."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
When you told me how glad you were to fight 
alongside me, I wanted to jump for joy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Yunaka] 
Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
Because somewhere along the way, I stopped 
being able to imagine my life without you in it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
There's no one more important to me than you. 
I want you by my side, always."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
So I guess that's my secret."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Yunaka] 
Divine One..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
If you'll accept it, I'd like you to have the 
Pact Ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Yunaka] 
But that ring is precious to you..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
You're precious to me, which is why I want 
you to have it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Alear] 
Whether we're talking about your past self, your 
current self, whatever─I cherish all of you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Yunaka] 
You're amazing!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Yunaka] 
I want to know everything about you. I want 
to accept all of you like you've accepted me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Yunaka] 
No more lies, no more secrets. I want to be with 
you the rest of my life. That's how I truly feel."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Alear] 
I feel the same way. Let's be true to each other, 
from now on, as partners."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Yunaka] 
Happily, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Yunaka] 
A new chapter starts today. I cannot wait to see 
what our future holds."
