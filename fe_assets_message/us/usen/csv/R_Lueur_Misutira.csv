[Timerra] 
Hey, Divine One, it's meat o'clock! You in?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
That depends. Will there be a surprise bandit- 
hunting trip this time?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
Hehe! No, I promise it's just you, me, and some 
fresh-grilled hunks of meat."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
I got a nice haul from the latest hunting trip, 
and I wanna share the spoils!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
All right. In that case, I'd be happy to partake."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
Woof... I'm so full I can hardly move..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
I must say, that was delicious. Good job at 
the grill."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Timerra] 
Uh-oh."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Timerra] 
OK, before you get mad...I really did intend for 
this to be a plain old picnic."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Timerra] 
But there are some thugs surrounding us, and 
it looks like they have other ideas."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
What?! I thought we cleared them out!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Timerra] 
I thought so too. There must have been a 
hideout I missed in my investigation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
Ah... There are a lot of them..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Timerra] 
I'll create a breach, and you run through 
to safety."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
Hm, good plan. But here's another to consider."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
Let's take them all out and eliminate the bandit 
threat once and for all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
If we do that, everyone in this entire region will 
feel much more safe."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Timerra] 
Hehe! Hate to admit it, but I like that better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
I guess you're rubbing off on me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Timerra] 
Come on! Let's make sure these jerks never 
ruin a picnic again!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alear] 
Right behind you!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Timerra] 2 

[Timerra] 
Thanks, Divine One. You really saved my bacon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
I was happy to help."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
I will say, I wasn't expecting our picnic to turn 
into a two-person raid on the bandits' hideout."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Timerra] 
Really? That's how most of my picnics go, 
to be honest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
When you invited me, you said we'd be eating 
meat together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Timerra] 
And I was telling the truth! You got a nice big 
helping, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
Yes, I was stuffed. I only wish you had said 
something like..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
""I've found the bandits' camp, so let's barge in, 
take them out, and then grill up some meat."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
That would have been more, you know, 
accurate."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Timerra] 
Hahaha! So wordy, though. My way was much 
more concise."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
That's one way to look at it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alear] 
Still, you never cease to amaze. You take it 
upon yourself to help root out bandits..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Timerra] 
What, is that not normal?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Timerra] 
I'm just protecting my people. I thought that's 
what royalty was supposed to do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
You say something completely radical like it's 
the most obvious thing in the world."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Timerra] 
Hahaha! That's my charm!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Timerra] 2 

[Timerra] 
Grilled and ready to go! This meat is so yummy 
it's gonna make your taste buds dance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Wow. That seems like a lot of meat for the 
two of us."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Timerra] 
Oh, no. This one's for me. I was gonna do 
yours next."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
What?! How do you eat that much?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Timerra] 
Oh, you know. Open my mouth, bite, chew. 
I won't bore you with all the details."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alear] 
Wow. You're really something, Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Timerra] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Timerra] 
THAT'S TRUE! I'M REALLY SOMETHING!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Timerra] 
I'M THE CROWN PRINCESS OF SOLM! AND 
I'M WEARING LOTS OF PRICELESS JEWELS!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alear] 
Please, keep your voice down!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
I've heard that this area isn't very safe."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Timerra] 
You can say that again. It's absolutely crawling 
with bandits."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Timerra] 
That's why I'm out here like a nice, tempting 
hunk of lamb on a spit."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
Wait a minute... That was your plan?! To use 
yourself as bait?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Timerra] 
It worked, didn't it? Look. Those bruisers have 
had their eye on us since we got here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
It looks like... It looks like they're getting ready 
for an ambush!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Timerra] 
Not if we pounce on 'em first! Come on─this 
oughta be a piece of cake for you and me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alear] 
Ugh, all right. But you know, a little heads-up 
would have been nice!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Timerra] 2 

[Timerra] 
Divine One, you know the people of Solm value 
freedom above everything else, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
I do."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Timerra] 
That goes for me too. I love doing whatever 
I want to do, whenever I want to do it! It's just..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Timerra] 
Do you ever feel chained down by your closest 
friendships?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Timerra] 
When we connect with people─you know, really 
bond with them─those bonds make us stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Timerra] 
I mean, our closest allies help us do things we 
could never do all by ourselves."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Timerra] 
That's powerful stuff. But those bonds─those 
friendships─can feel like obligations too."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
I see what you mean, and you're not wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
Sometimes, when you care about someone, you 
have to put their desires before your own."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
That happens in close relationships."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Timerra] 
So, you have to give up close relationships to 
really be free? Is that what you think?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
I think you should take this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Timerra] 
Is that...the Pact Ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
Yes, and I want you to have it, Timerra."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Timerra] 
Me?! But why?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
Because this will bring us closer together but 
never take your freedom from you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
I care about you, Timerra, and I don't want you 
to lose the thing you hold most dear."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Timerra] 
Do you really think you and I can have this 
kind of a bond and also have our freedom?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
Yes. I really do."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Timerra] 
That's so...beautiful. I suppose I have my 
answer, then."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Timerra] 
I─ I'll accept the ring."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
I promise you, though our hearts will remain 
connected, you will be free."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Timerra] 
I like the sound of that very 
much, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Timerra] 
This will be our bond forever... No matter where 
we are or where we go, we are always together."
