Well, well, well. So the thief turned out to be 
just some brat."

What do you say, boys? I bet we could get a 
pretty penny in ransom out of her parents."

My parents have no idea where I am, so that's 
a pretty weak threat if you ask me."

these bandits from causing any more trouble."

You guys are really strong, huh? Do you have 
room on your team for me?"
MID_ED2_#002,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
You want to join us? I should warn you, our 
battles will be much more grueling than that."
MID_ED2_#003,"[Alear] 
You'd be placing yourself in danger."
MID_ED2_#004,"[Anna] 
I know I'm small, but I pack a punch! I can take 
care of myself, guaranteed."
MID_ED2_#005,"[Anna] 
Besides, I've got nothing better to do. Not until 
I figure out where my family went."
MID_ED2_#006,"[Alear] 
You lost your family..."
MID_ED2_#007,"[Anna] 
It gets lonely on the road. Maybe if I travel with 
you folks, our paths will cross someday."

Well, if that's what you want, I have 
no objections."

Oh, and the name's Anna. But you can call me 
Lady Anna. Pleasure to be in business with you!"

I just wish we could have protected the girl."
MID_ED3_#002,"[Alear] 
What was a little girl doing in a bandit's fortress 
in the first place?"

But you're not a bandit, right? So why don't 
you keep me safe?"
