MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,"Oh! Morning, Divine One!"
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,Huh? You heard a stranger's voice?
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,There's no one else here.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004,Maybe you imagined it?
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,"Fast asleep, I see."
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#002,It doesn't look like anything could wake you.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,"Wow, I was wrong!"
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,You're a light sleeper after all. I'm impressed.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,"Guess we don't have to worry about any thugs 
getting the jump on you!"
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Ah... Hello, Divine One."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,"I worry about you. Someone could just walk 
right in here."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,And if that someone had my set of skills...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#004,it would be all too easy to take your life.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,"And you wouldn't believe the scabbard on 
this thing."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,The engravings alone are pure art...
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,"Oh─ Hey, how long have you been awake?"
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,"Divine One! Hey, Divine One!"
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002,"I've got something to─ Oh, you're asleep."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,"No, no!"
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,It's silly. Don't worry about it─go back to sleep.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,What? You're staying up...just to chat with me?
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004,That's really nice. Thank you.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,"I was gonna tell you all about this dagger 
I found at the market."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,"Full flat grind, polished steel like you've 
never seen..."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,"A vintage fishtail pommel and a point to take 
your eye out!"
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,Morning!
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,Do you like music?
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,You know...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004,I play a little myself.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#005,Maybe I'll show you sometime.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,I wonder what's in the Divine Dragon's room...
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#002,Let's get sneaky!
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,Ah! You're awake?!
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,"I, uh, I took a wrong turn! You know me, 
always...getting lost."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,I'll get out of your hair.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Fancy decor, sacred altar...just what you'd 
expect so far."
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,"All this stuff's so nice, though. 
Ooo, what's this?"
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,"Didn't think I'd find a musical instrument in 
here. Should I give it a try?"
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,"I've made up my mind, Divine One."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,I'm going to work on being more honest.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,"Starting with the small, pointless lies. No more 
bad habits."
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,Haah... I've gotta stop lying all the time.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002,What an awful habit...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,Ah! Was I too loud?!
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,I'm sorry─I didn't mean to wake you so soon.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,I can fix this. One little bump on the noggin...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#004,and you'll be back asleep in no time.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,"I gabbed at someone for an hour yesterday 
about my dog."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,I've never had a dog! I'm a cat person!
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,"So now I gotta remember who I told about the 
dog, what its name is, keep my story straight..."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,Hi!
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,"Hehe, what?"
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,"That's ridiculous. Of course there aren't any 
roosters in here."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004,Maybe you dreamed it?
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,"Zappy morning, Divine One!"
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,Hi! You're up!
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,It was my turn to wake you.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003,So...mission accomplished!
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Not gonna make this easy, huh?"
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,OK. Let's get serious.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,Time to break out my rooster impression!
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004,Caw-caw-doodle-do!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,Aha!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,So you get up right away for Sir Vander...
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,But you snooze right through Yunaka?!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004,I see how it is!
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,"Surprise, Divine One! It's Yunaka!"
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,Up and at 'em!
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,Feeling rested?
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,"Well, my work here is done..."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004,so...have a good one! See ya!
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,Hmm...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,Maybe I'm too easygoing.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,Let's try someone more strict. Ahem...
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004,"""Divine One! You must wake at once!"""
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,Huh? I'm different than usual?
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,Maybe you're right. But if that's true...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,It's because I'm holding nothing back.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004,"Whatever else I am, I'll always be your partner."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,Zappy! Only me.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002,Sorry your partner's not more glamorous.
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,"Hehe, flew out of bed the second I came 
along, didn't you?"
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,"I don't want to assume anything, but..."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,Were you excited to see me?
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Hehe, you're fierce on the battlefield, but 
you sleep like a little kitten."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,"It's weird, being with you..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,"Since you accept all of me, past and present..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,"For the first time in my life, I feel whole."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,"Is this what it's like to be accepted for who I 
truly am?"
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,"Thank you for showing me. I never would 
have known."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,I have a new secret for you.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,I'm enjoying life so much more now.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,But what I like most of all...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,is spending time with you.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,"Hehe! Ready or not, here I come!"
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,Found you! Not that it was hard.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,I'm usually the one hiding.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,"But with you, I don't have to hide anymore."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,Thank you for letting me be my truest self.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,Still asleep? You're bad at this game.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,"That's what I like about you, though. 
You never hide."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,"The more time we spend together, fighting 
back to back..."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,"the more I feel that honesty of yours rubbing off 
on me."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,I'm so grateful to you.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,"Now that I've come to terms with my past, I can 
finally look forward to the future."
