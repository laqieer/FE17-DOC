[Mauvier] 2 

[Veyle] 
Oh, the townsfolk seem so pleased! I can barely 
believe all the thanks pouring in."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Yes, the people do seem most appreciative. 
But our work has only just begun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
I hope they know our feelings are genuine and 
that we mean them well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
I was concerned they would hold a grudge. 
Revenge makes more sense than forgiveness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Veyle] 
I told you. The people here are good."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Mauvier] 
Indeed. You were right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Mauvier] 
It is wonderful that they welcomed us so."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Veyle] 
You know, there's something I've been 
thinking about."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Veyle] 
I wonder if Marni would have ever been willing 
to walk through these streets with us."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Mauvier] 
I do not dare to guess. But this much I know..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Mauvier] 
If Marni would have fought on this side, she'd 
have been a knight beloved by the people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Veyle] 
Oh yes, they would have loved her."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Veyle] 
If it weren't for Marni, I would have never had 
this chance to make things right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Veyle] 
It's impossible to express how grateful I am for 
what she did."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Mauvier] 
She would have loved to hear your praise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Mauvier] 
Let the two of us live to save as many people as 
we can. For Marni."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Veyle] 
I like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Veyle] 
We have so many wrongs to make up for. 
I don't know how we'll ever balance the scales."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Veyle] 
I guess we'll just have to add as much good 
to this world as we possibly can."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Veyle] 
Will you help me, Mauvier?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Mauvier] 
Of course. As a knight...and as a friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Mauvier] 
We do this together, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Veyle] 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle seems safe enough. For the time 
being anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Mauvier] 
I must not be noticed following her. I will stay 
back and observe without being seen."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Mauvier] 
I cannot imagine explaining to Marni that 
I allowed harm to befall Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Mauvier] 
[Veyle] 1 

[Veyle] 
Mauvier! I see you following me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Veyle] 
So, you don't think I can take care of myself? 
Is that what this is?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Mauvier] 
No. Or, rather, yes. I mean, I know you are very 
capable. But I also worry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Mauvier] 
It is my duty as a knight to keep you safe."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Veyle] 
You're not just a knight, you're also my friend. 
Instead of worrying about me, try trusting me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Mauvier] 
A friend? I did not know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Mauvier] 
If that is the case, please tell me why you walk 
through town alone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Mauvier] 
As your friend, I am concerned for your safety. 
I want to understand why you would do that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Veyle] 
I do it to atone for my sins."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Veyle] 
A lot of people were hurt because of me. I need 
to find something good I can do for this town."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle... Since that is the case, it is 
important that I be by your side."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Mauvier] 
As one of the Four Hounds, I also committed 
sins for which I must atone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Mauvier] 
You are not alone in your feelings...or your goal."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Veyle] 
You have such a good heart, Mauvier."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Veyle] 
And I'm lucky to have you as a friend."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Veyle] 
So, will you help me? Can we find something 
good to do for this town together?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Mauvier] 
Of course, Lady Veyle..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle, I've found you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Veyle] 
Oh, I didn't know you were looking for me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Mauvier] 
I was, indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Mauvier] 
Perhaps you don't realize, it is not safe for 
you to walk through town alone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Veyle] 
Not safe?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Veyle] 
Why do you say that? This town is full of 
good people."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Mauvier] 
Considering what we have done, some of these 
good people might rightfully want revenge."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Veyle] 
If that happens, then I'll apologize. We did...truly 
awful things."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Mauvier] 
An apology might well not be enough. 
If something were to happen to you..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Veyle] 
I'm not a child. I can take care of myself. 
Now stop following me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Mauvier] 
Wait. Please!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
No. I have something I need to do...on my own."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Veyle] 
[Mauvier] 
There she goes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Mauvier] 
She has no idea what she is risking."
