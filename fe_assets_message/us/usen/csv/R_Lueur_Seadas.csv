[Seadall] 2 

[Alear] 
Seadall, please, hear me out... I think your 
dancing is perfect."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alear] 
And enjoying the things you love every now 
and again won't change that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
What's this all about?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
I understand that your dancing is as beautiful as 
it is because you're so disciplined."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
But if you eat only to fuel the dance, you're 
not thinking how savory feeds the soul."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Seadall] 
Savory feeds...the soul?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
Your inner joy surely must also be part of 
your dance, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
When you danced in the moonlight thinking of 
those who had died...that was truly beautiful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
I'm sure that dancing while dreaming of savory 
foods must be distracting."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Seadall] 
You're trying to tell me my dance is less 
perfect because of this?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
Fuel your dance with things that bring you 
joy─we will feel the joy too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
I understand that you want to dance perfectly 
to protect your friends in battle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
All the more reason to fuel your moves with 
savory food too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Seadall] 
Divine One, you don't understand."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Seadall] 
If I fuel my dance with just anything I want, 
that's playing with fire."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Seadall] 
My life as a dancer has always put function 
before flavor."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Seadall] 
But...I am starting to see what you mean about 
savory feeding the soul."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Seadall] 
You're very thoughtful and that makes me 
happy. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
You're welcome."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Seadall] 
And given you are the Divine One, I will take 
your advice to heart."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Seadall] 
In fact, that fried dough bathed in oil sauce 
from the other day─it's been on my mind."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alear] 
Then let's go order some!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Seadall] 
Now the question is, how much savory is too 
much savory for one sitting?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alear] 
Perhaps we should consult the ""spirit of 
the cards""?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Seadall] 
Ah, you saw my reading the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Seadall] 
Divine One, I'm afraid you've only seen my 
undignified side lately."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alear] 
I've seen your charming side as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Seadall] 
I promise you this, from now on you'll see 
a better me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Seadall] 
I realize now the dance is both an inside and 
outside dance. Expect perfection!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Alear] 
I'm happy if you're happy, Seadall."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Seadall] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Seadall] 
Spirit of the cards! Moon and stars above! 
Cast your divine light and answer me!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
Seadall? What is he trying to divine with 
such...desperation?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Seadall] 
I beg you to tell me...will this food offer the 
perfect fuel for my dance?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Seadall] 
I yearn for more than merely food. I crave the 
savory! Please, spirit of the cards!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Seadall] 
Ugh! That was not the answer I wanted!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alear] 
Uh...he's not acting like he did before. Not at all."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
Please, calm down, Seadall."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Seadall] 
Divine One!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
I don't know what this is about, but this isn't 
like you at all. Crave...the savory?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Seadall] 
Are you trying to tell me that eating this will 
provide the perfect fuel for my dance?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Seadall] 
It's dough fried in butter and then bathed 
in an oil sauce...and it's incredibly delicious."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
Oh, I had one of those. It was delicious, all right. 
I'd think it'd be extra fuel for your dance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Seadall] 
Are you making that up?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Alear] 
Well..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Seadall] 
Or just guessing? I'll need to consult the cards 
for the real answer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I mean, I think I do know!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
You're doing all that dancing. It's got to be 
good fuel and tasty too!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Seadall] 
You don't understand. A dancer of my caliber 
must be disciplined."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Seadall] 
On the battlefield, I must inspire all with my 
perfect dancing. So I must eat only perfect food."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Seadall] 
If I'm careless, if my dancing suffers and 
someone dies... I can't allow that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alear] 
Seadall, I'm sorry..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Seadall] 
Now, I must retreat to the fortune shop, and to 
a meal that is not fried."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1

[Seadall] 
♪Hmm hmm hmm...♪"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Practicing your dancing tonight, Seadall?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Seadall] 
Ah, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Seadall] 
It's not so much practice as it is performance. 
I have an audience tonight, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
But there's no one around."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Seadall] 
There's the moon."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
The moon?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Seadall] 
That's right. The silver light shining in the 
dark above."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Seadall] 
And the multitude of stars too. I perform for 
them all tonight."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Seadall] 
Divine One, did you know that when people die, 
they leave their form behind and become stars?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Seadall] 
My teacher is up in that sky."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
This teacher of yours died then?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Seadall] 
He did. These dance steps were the ones he 
loved most."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Seadall] 
♪Hmm hmm hmm...♪"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alear] 
It's beautiful, Seadall. Every single movement 
is just...gorgeous."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Seadall] 
I give up many of life's pleasures in pursuit of 
perfecting the craft of my dance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Seadall] 
It's not easy. I practice my steps intently, and 
I am vigilant about what fuels my dance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Seadall] 
My dancing skills are renowned in Solm. 
Complacency and mediocrity are not an option."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alear] 
You're so disciplined. I respect that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alear] 
And there's something otherworldly about you. 
Sometimes I'm not sure I should get too close."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Seadall] 
May I resume dancing now?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Alear] 
Oh! Yes, of course. I'm sorry I interrupted you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Seadall] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Seadall] 
Divine One, I've been waiting for you. I'd like to 
perform a special dance for you tonight."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
A special dance?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Seadall] 
That's right. It's a dance meant for an audience 
of one─for you alone."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Seadall] 
Let me begin."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
Seadall, that was incredible. I'm genuinely 
moved!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Seadall] 
I did what you said. I fed my soul with savory 
dishes and let it move me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
Haha! I'm really glad to hear that. But why the 
special dance?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Seadall] 
First, let me tell you what the dance means."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
Yes, please."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Seadall] 
The dance is a promise─a promise I can 
perform for one person only."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Seadall] 
You are very special to me, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Seadall] 
I'll say it plainly. I've cared for you ever since 
we met at that fortress."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Seadall] 
Others hold you dear, I know. How could they 
not? But their feelings can't compare to mine."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Seadall] 
So I wonder, is it possible you feel something 
like I do in return?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
Seadall, let me explain."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Seadall] 
I'm sorry, that was incredibly forward of me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
No, I'm happy you said it. I'm even happier 
you feel that way. Because I feel the same."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Seadall] 
You do?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
I do. In fact, I've been thinking that this ring... 
would look perfect on you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Seadall] 
The Pact Ring?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
The very one."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Seadall] 
I feel like the moon and all the stars have lit up 
inside my chest."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Seadall] 
I promise you, I will work hard and make you 
proud to have me standing by your side."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Alear] 
Hehe, you shine so brightly, I only hope I can 
add a bit more glow."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
Seadall, I'm so happy we get to walk this 
path together."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Seadall] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Seadall] 
Nothing in this lovely, mysterious world could 
keep me from you."
