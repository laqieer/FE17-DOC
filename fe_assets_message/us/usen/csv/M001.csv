[Framme] 
Divine One! Vander! Thanks for saving us."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Clanne] 
Yeah. And, uh...sorry. This all happened because 
we ran ahead."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alear] 
I'm the one who should apologize. You put 
yourselves in danger trying to protect me."
MID_ED1_#004,It's such a relief you're both safe now...
MID_ED1_#005,"[Vander] 
Divine One, I hear more enemies approaching."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
More? I thought we'd gotten them all."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Vander] 
Evidently not."
MID_ED1_#008,These creatures... Will there be no end to them?

[Lumera] 
Is it really you, ?"
MID_ED3_#002,"[Alear] 
Yes, it's me. Thank you for saving us."
MID_ED3_#003,"[Lumera] 
What a joy it is to see you, ."
MID_ED3_#004,"[Alear] 
Huh?"
MID_ED3_#005,"[Lumera] 
I've waited for so long!"
MID_ED3_#006,"[Alear] 
Oh!"
MID_ED3_#007,"[Lumera] 
When I sensed you had awoken, I flew here as 
fast as my wings would carry me."
MID_ED3_#008,I hope you're not hurt.
MID_ED3_#009,"[Alear] 
I'm... I'm fine."
MID_ED3_#010,"[Lumera] 
What a relief! You cannot understand how I've 
missed you, my dear child."
MID_ED3_#011,"[Alear] 
Oh! You're...my mother."
MID_ED3_#012,"[Lumera] 
What's the matter? Don't tell me..."
MID_ED3_#013,"[Vander] 3 

[Vander] 
Since awakening, the Divine One's memory 
is clouded."
MID_ED3_#014,"[Lumera] 
Oh! I see."
MID_ED3_#015,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry. I'm sure you weren't expecting this."
MID_ED3_#016,"[Lumera] 
No, I must apologize. I was so overcome 
with joy, I hugged you as hard as I could."
MID_ED3_#017,I take this to mean you've forgotten...everything.
MID_ED3_#018,"I suppose it's to be expected. A thousand years 
is a very long time."
MID_ED3_#019,"[Alear] 
Vander explained that I've been sleeping since... 
since some war that happened back then."
MID_ED3_#020,"[Lumera] 
Yes. You suffered a terrible wound. And... 
and because of that..."
MID_ED3_#021,"[Alear] 
A wound? I don't remember that. Or this world, 
or anything."
MID_ED3_#022,"[Lumera] 
Don't fret, young one. I will speak to you of all 
you've forgotten."
MID_ED3_#023,"Regardless of what you remember, I'm simply 
glad to have you back, my dear child."
MID_ED3_#024,"[Alear] 
Still...this isn't the reunion you hoped for."
MID_ED3_#025,"[Lumera] 
Oh, don't worry about me. It's solace enough 
just to hear that sweet voice of yours!"
MID_ED3_#026,"And to gaze once more into your eyes. 
What lovely colors they are, ."

awake at long last..."

What an honor."

Um, not to be rude, but...who are you?"
MID_OP2_#007,"[Vander] 
Ah! Apologies. I lost myself for a moment there."

the Dragon."
MID_OP2_#009,"[Alear] 
Hello, Sir Vander."

Oh my, Divine One! There is no need to address 
me as such. Simply ""Vander"" will do."
MID_OP2_#011,"[Framme] 3

See! I told you the Divine Dragon was awake!"
MID_OP2_#012,"[Clanne]

You two. I don't believe I got your names."

Oh, sorry! We were so excited we forgot to 
introduce ourselves."
MID_OP2_#015,"We're the 33rd Stewards of the Dragon! 
My name's Clanne. Pleased to meet you."
MID_OP2_#016,"[Framme] 
And I'm Framme! We're twins."
MID_OP2_#017,We've been waiting forever for you to wake up!
MID_OP2_#018,"[Vander] 
As Stewards of the Dragon, our mission is to 
protect and provide for you."
MID_OP2_#019,"Generation after generation of our predecessors 
waited for you to rise from your slumber."
MID_OP2_#020,"I'll admit, I am astonished to see it has 
finally happened."
MID_OP2_#021,"You see, a thousand years have passed since 
the first steward took their post."
MID_OP2_#022,"[Alear] 
A thousand years? That's how long I've 
been asleep?"
MID_OP2_#023,"[Vander] 
Indeed. Your mother─Lumera, the Divine 
Dragon Monarch─has long awaited this day."
MID_OP2_#024,"Finally you, a Divine Dragon yourself, have 
awakened. This surely signifies great things."
MID_OP2_#025,"[Alear] 
Slow down. This monarch you mentioned─ 
she's my mother?"
MID_OP2_#026,"And I'm a ""Divine Dragon,"" you called it?"
MID_OP2_#027,"[Vander] 
Oh dear. Is your memory hazy, Divine One?"
MID_OP2_#028,"[Alear] 
I know my name, but...that's about it."
MID_OP2_#029,"[Clanne] 
You can't remember anything else?"
MID_OP2_#030,"[Framme] 
Maybe you're just feeling groggy 'cause of 
all that sleep?"
MID_OP2_#031,"[Alear] 
But I don't even know who I am."
MID_OP2_#032,"[Vander] 
Fret not. Such lapses in memory are to be 
expected after sleeping for so long."
MID_OP2_#033,"If I may... You are a Divine Dragon, a member of 
a royal family of dragons revered as deities."
MID_OP2_#034,"Queen Lumera, the Divine Dragon Monarch, 
rules over the Holy Land of Lythos."
MID_OP2_#035,"In the war a thousand years ago, she defeated 
and imprisoned the wicked Fell Dragon."
MID_OP2_#036,"You, Divine One, are her only child."
MID_OP2_#037,"[Alear] 
The war, the Fell Dragon... I feel like I can 
almost remember, but..."
MID_OP2_#038,"[Vander] 
Please, do not trouble yourself trying to bring it 
all back at once."
MID_OP2_#039,"Your memories will return in time. You are 
a being of immense power─a deity, no less."
MID_OP2_#040,"I have heard many a tale of your kindness, 
nobility, and bravery. Your unflinching heroism."
MID_OP2_#041,"[Alear] 
That's a lot to live up to."
MID_OP2_#042,"[Vander] 
For now, let us head to Lythos Castle. Queen 
Lumera will be thrilled to see you."
MID_OP2_#043,"Perhaps the reunion will help stir 
your memories."
MID_OP2_#044,"[Alear] 
I hope so."
MID_OP2_#045,"[Clanne] 
OK, then! Onward and downward!"
MID_OP2_#046,"[Framme] 
To Lythos Castle!"
MID_OP3C_#001,Raaargh!
MID_OP3C_#002,Huh?!
MID_OP3C_#003,Wh-what are those horrible things?!
MID_OP3C_#004,"Vander! Are creatures like that common 
around here?"
MID_OP3C_#005,They're not. I've never seen them.
MID_OP3C_#006,"Nor have I heard of such monsters appearing in 
Lythos before. This is a land of peace."
MID_OP3C_#007,Understood. Well...
MID_OP3C_#008,Shall we fight them?
MID_OP3C_#008_2,"As you wish, Divine One! You whose bravery 
knows no equal."
MID_OP3C_#009,No. Let's run.
MID_OP3C_#010,Huh?
MID_OP3C_#011,We haven't the slightest idea who they are.
MID_OP3C_#011_2,And we don't know how they came to be here.
MID_OP3C_#012,Also... They worry me for some reason.
MID_OP3C_#012_2,"So, we run!"
MID_OP3C_#013,"I, er, well... Did the Divine Dragon really 
command me to retreat?"
MID_OP3C_#014,OK! Get to safety!
MID_OP3C_#015,We'll keep them distracted for you!
MID_OP3C_#016,What the─ Come back! Come back this instant!
MID_OP3C_#017,Raaargh!
MID_OP3C_#018,Ah! Oh no!
MID_OP3C_#019,"Uh, this isn't looking good..."
MID_OP3C_#020,Clanne! Framme!

[Alear] 
All this time, I've been sleeping in the sky?"
MID_OP3_#002,"[Vander] 
You have, yes. The place where you slumbered 
is known as the Somniel."
MID_OP3_#003,"A fortress built upon an airborne island to 
ensure your safety."
MID_OP3_#004,"It is perhaps the most secure place in all of 
Elyos. Only a select few can set foot there."
MID_OP3_#005,"[Alear] 
I see. And you three live there with me?"
MID_OP3_#006,"[Framme] 
Yup! As stewards, we spend our time caring for 
you and managing things around the Somniel."
MID_OP3_#007,"It's a sacred place, so we work as hard as we 
can to keep it shipshape!"
MID_OP3_#008,"[Clanne] 
Royal family members visit us all the time! 
Well, visit you, really."
MID_OP3_#009,"The prince and princess of Firene─a deeply 
religious country─visit especially often."
MID_OP3_#010,"[Framme] 
They pray next to you, like this. Then they just... 
talk for a while, like they're chatting to a friend."
MID_OP3_#011,"[Alear] 
I see. Thanks for filling me in, Framme. 
You too, Clanne."
MID_OP3_#012,"[Framme] 
Ah! The Divine One said our names! And 
thanked us!"
MID_OP3_#013,"[Clanne] 
I think I'm going to faint...unless I already did. 
Am I dreaming?"
MID_OP3_#014,"[Vander] 
Need I remind you that you are in the presence 
of the Divine Dragon!"
MID_OP3_#015,"How many times must I tell you to behave in a 
manner befitting your station?"
MID_OP3_#016,"Divine One, please forgive this embarrassing 
breach of decorum."
MID_OP3_#017,"[Alear] 
Breach of decorum? Haha, I'm actually enjoying 
their enthusiasm."
MID_OP3_#018,"[Framme] 
Hehe! You're just as kindhearted as I always 
imagined!"
MID_OP3_#019,"[Clanne] 
Oh, look, there it is!"
MID_OP3_#020,"[Alear] 
Lythos Castle. The...Divine Dragon Monarch is 
there, you said?"
MID_OP3_#021,"[Vander] 
Yes. I suppose a thousand years have passed 
since you've been home."
MID_OP3_#022,"[Framme] 
Don't worry. We'll be right there with you."
MID_OP3_#023,"[Clanne] 
You can hold my hand if you like."
MID_OP3_#024,"[Alear] 
Thank you."
MID_OP3_#025,Hm?
MID_OP3_#026,"How long have I been wearing this ring? Since 
before I fell asleep?"
MID_OP3_#027,That blue stone... It reminds me of something...
