Thank you, all of you, for rescuing me."
MID_ED1_#004,"My children, you're safe. What a relief."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alfred] 
We have a guest, Mother. Someone came all

[Alear] 
Queen Ève, it's an honor to meet you. I'm so 
glad that you're all right."
MID_ED1_#008,I've come here by invitation of Prince Alfred.
MID_ED1_#009,"[Ève] 
Just look at you. Awake at long last."
MID_ED1_#010,"I am Ève, the queen of Firene. It is my absolute 
pleasure to welcome you."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Alfred] 4 
[Alfred] 
The Divine Dragon has come to help our 
country, Mother."
MID_ED1_#012,We were just in time to rescue Céline.
MID_ED1_#013,"And get this! The Divine One summoned 
Emblem Celica from our ring."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Ève] 
The legendary Emblem! Oh my, 
how extraordinary."
MID_ED1_#015,"Thank you, sincerely. You have my 
deepest gratitude."
MID_ED1_#016,My family is safe because of you.
MID_ED1_#017,"You are blessed with the same powers as 
your mother. How is Queen Lumera?"
MID_ED1_#018,"[Alear] 
Well, she's..."
MID_ED1_#019,She's gone. My mother passed away.
MID_ED1_#020,"[Ève] 
No..."
MID_ED1_#021,That's awful. I'm so sorry.
MID_ED1_#022,"[Alear] 
Some intruders entered the castle. They tried 
to kill me, but..."
MID_ED1_#023,She gave her life to protect mine.
MID_ED1_#024,"[Ève] 
Oh... How tragic..."
MID_ED1_#025,"[Alear] 
I'm glad that...that I could spare your children 
the pain of losing their mother..."
MID_ED1_#026,...
MID_ED1_#027,"[Ève] 
My heart goes out to you..."
MID_ED1_#028,"[Alear] 
Forgive me. We've only just met and here I am, 
laying my grief at your feet."
MID_ED1_#029,I just wish I could have saved her too.
MID_ED1_#030,"[Ève] 
Divine One..."
MID_ED1_#031,"While I cannot take away your sorrow, perhaps 
I can help you bear it."
MID_ED1_#032,"To reunite with her, and then lose her so soon... 
I can only imagine how painful that was."
MID_ED1_#033,"For now, allow yourself to grieve, knowing that 
I grieve with you."
MID_ED1_#034,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Queen Ève."
MID_ED1_#035,"Your warmth, your kindness... It's almost like 
she's here with me."

How are you feeling?"
MID_ED2_#002,"[Alear]

MID_ED2_#003,"[Alfred] 
No, we shouldn't have dragged you into all 
this...right now."
MID_ED2_#004,"I'm sorry, Divine One."
MID_ED2_#005,"[Céline] 
As am I."
MID_ED2_#006,"[Alear] 
But if I hadn't left when I did, what might have 
happened to you, Céline? Or you, Queen Ève?"
MID_ED2_#007,"I'm proud to serve people in need, like my 
mother did."
MID_ED2_#008,"[Alfred] 
Thank you."
MID_ED2_#009,"[Alear] 
Now, the Elusian leader... She said her kingdom 
released the Fell Dragon."
MID_ED2_#010,"I take it that's why the Corrupted are appearing 
in Elyos again."
MID_ED2_#011,"[Alfred] 
Now there's no question that the Fell Dragon's 
after the rings."
MID_ED2_#012,"Which means we need to hurry. Head them off 
before they can reach the next one."
MID_ED2_#013,"[Alear] 
Queen Ève, your country's ring... May I take it?"
MID_ED2_#014,"[Ève] 
Of course. The kingdom of Firene gives it with 
love, trust, and gratitude."
MID_ED2_#015,"[Alear] 
Thank you very much."
MID_ED2_#016,"[Ève] 
There is something you should know, however..."
MID_ED2_#017,"My kingdom has another Emblem Ring in 
its possession."
MID_ED2_#018,"[Alfred] 
What? Since when?"
MID_ED2_#019,"[Céline] 
There is another ring? Here, in Firene?"
MID_ED2_#020,"[Ève] 
It was kept secret to avoid conflict."
MID_ED2_#021,"For generations, knowledge of this ring has 
been confined to the monarchs of Firene."
MID_ED2_#022,"However, now that the Fell Dragon has arisen, 
it is best to dispel the shroud of secrecy."
MID_ED2_#023,"It is commonly thought that the Divine Dragon 
gave one ring to each country's leader."
MID_ED2_#024,"However, Firene received a second."
MID_ED2_#025,The Ring of the Dawn Maiden.
MID_ED2_#026,"[Alear] 
I see..."
MID_ED2_#027,"[Ève] 
To ensure that no one would find it, the ring 
was hidden away far from the castle."
MID_ED2_#028,It rests in a shrine on the Brodian border.
MID_ED2_#029,"[Alfred] 
Ah, I remember those old ruins."
MID_ED2_#030,"[Céline] 
What? You do?"
MID_ED2_#031,"[Alfred] 
Yeah. Mother took me there after Father died."
MID_ED2_#032,"She told me to keep the location in mind. 
At the time, I didn't know why..."
MID_ED2_#033,Now it makes sense.
MID_ED2_#034,"[Ève] 
I was preparing you for the day you 
became king."
MID_ED2_#035,"[Alfred] 
I'll take everyone to the shrine. From there, 
I can continue on with the Divine Dragon."
MID_ED2_#036,"[Ève] 
So you are leaving, Alfred."
MID_ED2_#037,"[Alfred] 
Yes. I want to do my part to end this war."
MID_ED2_#038,"With your blessing, Mother, I'm going to help 
the Divine Dragon bring peace to Elyos."
MID_ED2_#039,"[Céline] 
Mother, I would like to join as well."
MID_ED2_#040,"[Alear] 
Alfred... Céline..."
MID_ED2_#041,"[Ève] 
You have my blessing. I know you will serve the 
Divine Dragon with honor."
MID_ED2_#042,"On one condition. Swear to me that you will 
come back alive."
MID_ED2_#043,"[Alfred] 
I swear it."
MID_ED2_#044,"[Céline] 
I swear it."
MID_ED2_#045,"[Alear] 
Thank you very much, Queen Ève."
MID_ED2_#046,"[Ève] 
I trust that you will take some time to rest prior 
to your departure."
MID_ED2_#047,"The journey ahead will be arduous, but know 
that you are all in my prayers."
MID_ED2_#048,May good fortune shine upon you.

than they looked!"
MID_ED4C_#006,"But I─ I can tell you things! Stuff that'll help you track it 
down! Like the fact that Princess Céline ran off with it."
MID_ED4C_#007,"The Divine Dragon has it now. 
Pretty good info, right? Heh..."
MID_ED4C_#008,Hmm...
MID_ED4C_#009,"Whaddaya say? How 'bout we call it even this 
time around? I won't let you down again."
MID_ED4C_#010,"Oh, how naive you are."

MID_ED4C_#013,Hmph.

her place. I can't believe that beast had a child."
