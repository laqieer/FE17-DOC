[Zelkov] 
Urg..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Clanne] 
Zelkov? What's wrong? You're making that 
scary face again."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
Uh-oh, did the sauce not turn out well?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Zelkov] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Clanne] 
I...I guess not. Sorry to hear that. I wish I could 
have done more to help."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Zelkov] 
*Taste* it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Clanne] 
Huh? But I thought it didn't turn out..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Zelkov] 
*Taste* it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Clanne] 
OK..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Clanne] 
Well, um, let's see here... Uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Clanne] 
Wait, what?! This is delicious!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Clanne] 
The pickles are sweet and sour in perfect 
balance. This sauce is amazing!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Zelkov] 
*Indeed.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Clanne] 
So, why do you look so upset? You mastered 
the sauce, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Zelkov] 
Yes. The *sauce* is perfect. But now there is an 
even greater struggle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Zelkov] 
I do not know a dish that is *worthy* of it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Clanne] 
Oooh. That's why you look scary."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Zelkov] 
I was certain the sauce would be my *triumph.* 
Only now do I see the depths of my foolishness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Clanne] 
I think my pickles go with everything, but the 
best pairing would probably be with red meat."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Zelkov] 
*Meat,* you say?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Clanne] 
Waaah! You're doing the scary face again!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Zelkov] 
You are a savant, Clanne. A culinary *genius.* 
I find myself once again in your debt."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Zelkov] 
If there exists a meat dish *worthy* of this sauce 
then you and I shall taste it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Clanne] 
Y-yeah, um...sure. OK. I'm starting to get used 
to that face, anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Clanne] 
I'll accompany you to the very end of this 
journey, as we make *delicious food* together!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 
[Clanne] 
Ooh gosh... Ooh geez... What kind of horrible 
thing is he going to make me do?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
What if he wants me to be an accomplice to 
a crime? I can't do it. I can't accomple!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Zelkov] 
The moment is upon us, Clanne. You must 
instruct me in the art of *pickles.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Clanne] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Zelkov] 
*Pickles,* Clanne. I must learn them. You must 
teach them to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Zelkov] 
Whispers abound that your prowess in the way 
of *pickles* is unmatched. Is this not so?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Clanne] 
No, that's true. I do really like making pickles."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Clanne] 
So the skill I have that you need...is pickling?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Clanne] 
Hah, that's a relief! I thought you were going to 
ask me to do something...I don't know, sinister."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Zelkov] 
I assure you, my *pickle* aspirations are 
not nefarious."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Now dispense with the *japes* if you would be 
so kind. This is a serious matter."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Zelkov] 
I have recently taken up a *pursuit* of the 
culinary arts."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Clanne] 
Oh, you started cooking? That's nice! I think 
that's wonderful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Zelkov] 
I have mastered numerous dishes. But a certain 
sauce with minced *pickles* eludes my grasp."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Zelkov] 
My technique requires *refinement.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Clanne] 
Couldn't you just, um, buy some pickles from 
the market?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Zelkov] 
And soar to greatness on stolen wings? 
Absolutely not. The *pickles* will be mine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Clanne] 
Ahh... And that's where I come in."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Clanne] 
OK, sure. I'd be happy to teach you anything 
you want to know about making pickles."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Zelkov] 
*Marvelous.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Clanne] 
So, since I'm teaching you, I trust you'll be 
a good pupil?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Zelkov] 
Of course. The fate of my *sauce* is at stake."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Zelkov] 
At last, Clanne... I have *tracked* you down."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Ahh!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Clanne] 
Y-y-you frightened me! ...Um, you're 
Zelkov, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Zelkov] 
Indeed. Interesting... Has something in particular 
about me *frightened* you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Clanne] 
Uh, mostly your face, I guess..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Zelkov] 
You mean to say I have an unsettling *visage*?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Clanne] 
Uh, um, I mean... Did you need me for 
something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Zelkov] 
Yes. I am going to ask you a question. You will 
provide your answer *immediately.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Clanne] 
Eep!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Clanne] 
Did...did I...do something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Not yet. But that is about to *change.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Clanne] 
Wh-what do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Zelkov] 
I have a problem that can only be resolved by 
your *particular* skills."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Clanne] 
What skills? I-I don't have any skills...at 
crime stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Zelkov] 
What was that? Speak up. Allow your voice to 
carve through the silence like a *knife.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Zelkov] 
Otherwise I may begin to feel you lack the 
*conviction* to assist me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Clanne] 
No, no, no! It's fine─totally fine! Haha! 
Happy to help!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Clanne] 
Just...please stop making that scary face."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Zelkov] 
Excellent. Thank you. Now, please keep this 
discussion *solely* between us."
