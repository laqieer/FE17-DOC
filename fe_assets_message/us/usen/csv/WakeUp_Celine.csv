MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,What do you say to a walk before breakfast?
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,"I'd like to show you the place where these 
flowers are blooming."
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,"The most gorgeous flowers are in bloom this 
morning, Divine One!"
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,Do you enjoy horticulture as much as I?
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,"I tend the lovelies down by the pond, you know."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,"If you'd like to pay them a visit, I'd be happy to 
introduce you."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,I was going to bring you a blossom...
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,but I could not bring myself to pick it.
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,"Beauty is given such precious little time to 
thrive already."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,"Good morning. Let us make ready for the 
day's battle."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,"I am prepared to fight─both for Firene's peace 
and for you."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,"To that end, I will do whatever is necessary."
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,"I greatly appreciate you lending me your ear 
as of late."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,I am proud to fight for my nation.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,"But you fight for the entire world─and that is 
far more pressure."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,"If you ever need someone to talk to, I am here."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,After the bandits...
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,"I became concerned that I had grown weak. 
But your words reassured me."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,"You said that what I felt was not weakness, 
but kindness."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#004,Perhaps someday I'll believe that.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,"If you ever wish to talk, Divine One... 
about anything..."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,please know I would gladly lend you an ear.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,"Haha, perhaps I shouldn't trouble you about 
it first thing in the morning."
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,It still feels odd to come here on my own.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,Morning.
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,"Haha, your hair is rather a mess, Divine One."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,I will go and fetch a comb for you.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,Visiting you here has always carried...
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,an air of solemnity.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,"In the past, my family and I were always 
escorted in..."
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004,by Queen Lumera.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,"I suppose all the folktales around here would be 
about you, wouldn't they?"
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,"Haha, that's quite a lovely..."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004,and uplifting thought.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,"Ah, the Somniel..."
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002,"A stroll among such gorgeous flowers always 
put me at ease."
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,I pray you can put aside your cares enough...
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,to find joy in this serene and beautiful morning.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,I wonder if the Somniel has folktales...
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,like those of the Firene royal palace.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,"I could believe the enchanting scenery here was 
home to a spirit or two."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,Apologies! You startled me.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,"I should not have been shocked to see you rise. 
You do so every day now."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,In any case... Good morning.
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,"It's Céline, Divine One. I hope I'm not intruding."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,Ah. You're awake.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,"You rise with grace and dignity. I expected 
no less."
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,Being here brings back memories.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,Mother used to bring Alfred and me here.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,"You slept in just the same way back then. The 
only difference is you did not wake."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,"Good, you're awake. The tea is still warm."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,"Let's enjoy it together, shall we?"
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,It's one of my favorites.
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,"That was a longer walk than I thought. I hope 
the tea hasn't gone cold."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,I've brought tea to brighten your day.
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,Shall we partake?
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,You're a heavy sleeper.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,That's all right.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,I'll set the tea here so you can enjoy the aroma.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004,"These bright floral notes are bound to give you 
pleasant dreams."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,You wake gracefully...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,like a flower in bloom.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,And like the flowers here...
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004,I intend to protect and look after you.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,"I've come to wake you, my friend."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,"Good morning. I've brought your favorite tea 
for us to share."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,We've taken tea together so often by now...
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,"that I cannot do so anywhere without thinking 
of you."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,Thank you again for the Pact Ring. Truly.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,"Alfred was perhaps a touch surprised to hear 
about it..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,"but he's very glad that I have a friend who will 
support me no matter what."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,"For me, it's a huge relief."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,I've come to rely on you ever so much.
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,"So I hope you will take good care of yourself 
throughout this war."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#007,I do not think I could stand to lose you.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Hm.
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,"I have decided I will leave the Pact Ring here 
when we head out to battle."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,I'd like it to remain as pure and beautiful...
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,as it is now─and as the friendship it represents.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,I like coming here.
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002,It's more special to me now.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,No matter what happens...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,I know I'll find comfort...
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,and support in your company.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,"Armed with that knowledge, I can confidently 
steel myself for any battlefield."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,Whatever battle brings...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,whatever choices I must make...
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,"I know now that I will always have someone 
who stands by me."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,"That knowledge fills me with confidence like 
never before."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,"With you by my side, my friend..."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,"I feel as though I can withstand the most 
harrowing quandary."
