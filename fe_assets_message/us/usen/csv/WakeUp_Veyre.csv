MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#001,Sorry I woke you up.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#002,Please let me stay a little longer.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#003,I've slept on an altar before...
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#004,but I've never ever prayed on one.
MID_WU_A_1_HELLO_#005,"I just hope a Fell Dragon's prayers can be 
heard from here."
MID_WU_A_1_IN_#001,"Even when it's dark outside, it's bright in here. 
The stars light everything up."
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#001,Did I wake you? I'm sorry.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#002,It's just...I had a bad dream.
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#003,"Please, can I stay here a little longer?"
MID_WU_A_1_SOON_#004,"Hehe, thank you. You're very kind."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#001,"They say you become a star in the sky 
when you die."
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#002,"I wonder...are Mama and Marni and the others 
up there somewhere?"
MID_WU_A_1_WAKEUP_#003,"And what about the other me? Maybe...maybe 
she's a pretty star too."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#002,"I feel like we're just normal siblings when we're 
together like this."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#003,"I suppose I don't know what ""normal"" 
even means."
MID_WU_A_2_HELLO_#004,But I want to figure that out with you.
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#001,Ah...
MID_WU_A_2_IN_#002,I love getting to see you whenever I want.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#001,"I spent so long wishing I could see you and 
spend time with you."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#002,Part of me wants the same with Papa.
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#003,"No, I used to want that..."
MID_WU_A_2_SOON_#004,But that wish...that dream...is gone.
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Thank you for letting me tell you how I felt 
about Papa the other day."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#002,"It's hard, but I'm finally ready to break that 
bond I had with him."
MID_WU_A_2_WAKEUP_#003,I'll do it with my own hands too.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#001,"Hehe, I think I'm getting a bit nostalgic."
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#002,Though I don't ever want to go back there.
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#003,Forget the dark...
MID_WU_B_1_HELLO_#004,I want to live in the light.
MID_WU_B_1_IN_#001,"The altar of the Divine Dragon and the altar of 
the Fell Dragon...they're just so...different."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#001,"Oh, you're awake."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#002,"I was just thinking about the altar I used to 
sleep on."
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#003,How did I like it? Well...
MID_WU_B_1_SOON_#004,It was a lot different than yours.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#001,The altar I slept on was in a dark place.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#002,Almost no sunlight got in.
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#003,"There were candles here and there, and they 
flickered in the dark."
MID_WU_B_1_WAKEUP_#004,That was pretty.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#001,I'm sorry. I woke you!
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#002,"It's true, I don't have my own 
dragonstone anymore."
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#003,And I don't regret it.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#004,I don't need to be a big dragon.
MID_WU_B_2_HELLO_#005,I have the power I need right here.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#001,I dreamed about the broken dragonstone.
MID_WU_B_2_IN_#002,I was afraid something happened to you.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#001,Ah... It's such a relief knowing you're all right.
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#002,"Hehe, I was worried sick before, but now I'm 
actually a little hungry!"
MID_WU_B_2_SOON_#003,"I hope you don't mind, but I've got to find 
something spicy to eat."
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#001,Ah... You're sound asleep. What a relief that is.
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#002,"I wonder if it was my own dragonstone I saw in 
my dream?"
MID_WU_B_2_WAKEUP_#003,"I decided I didn't ever want to turn into a 
dragon, so I buried it."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#001,"Oh, good morning."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#002,I'm proud of who I've become.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#003,"But it never would have happened if I hadn't 
fought for it."
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#004,It wasn't easy.
MID_WU_C_1_HELLO_#005,Being here right now...it was all worth it!
MID_WU_C_1_IN_#001,"So, this is it...the altar of the Divine Dragon."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#001,Good morning.
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#002,"I wonder, is this the way you looked?"
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#003,"The day you woke up, I mean."
MID_WU_C_1_SOON_#004,"I wish I could have been there to see your 
eyes open."
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#001,This is where you slept? All that time?
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#002,Ah... If only I'd known you were here sooner.
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#003,"No, it wouldn't have mattered."
MID_WU_C_1_WAKEUP_#004,"Even if I had come long ago, I never would have 
been allowed to see you."
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#001,Good morning!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#002,How do you feel?
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#003,I hope you're rested and refreshed.
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#004,Because your little sister is here!
MID_WU_C_2_HELLO_#005,And she's ready to talk to you about everything!
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#001,"Have you ever pretended you couldn't 
wake up?"
MID_WU_C_2_IN_#002,"You know, just so people would come talk 
to you while you slept?"
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#001,"Hehe, did I guess right?"
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#002,"It's OK. I once pretended I couldn't be 
woken up..."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#003,"just so people would come share their thoughts 
with me."
MID_WU_C_2_SOON_#004,"Hmm, what thoughts should I share with you?"
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#001,"Hmm... Could that be what you're doing 
right now?"
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#002,Or maybe you're just sound asleep.
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#003,"I know what it's like to fall into a deep, 
deep sleep."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#004,"I am a dragon, after all."
MID_WU_C_2_WAKEUP_#005,"Still, it's time for you to rise and shine!"
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#001,Finally! You woke up!
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#002,Time to get going.
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#003,"We have to get to the portal that leads to 
the other worlds."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#004,"And when we get there, we're going to 
stop Papa..."
MID_WU_S_1_HELLO_#005,no matter what.
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#001,"It's morning! I know you're sleepy, but..."
MID_WU_S_1_IN_#002,you can't save the world if you don't wake up!
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#001,Good morning!
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#002,"It's funny. I've been waking up feeling really 
good lately, hehe!"
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#003,"Now, if I could ever get you out of bed..."
MID_WU_S_1_SOON_#004,I'm sure we could accomplish anything!
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#001,"Sheesh, you're taking forever to wake up."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#002,"But it doesn't matter. I'm here. You're here. 
And we're a real family now."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#003,"When we're together like this, I just know I'll 
never lose you like I did before."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#004,"The Pact Ring won't shatter, not like your 
dragonstone did."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#005,"And anyway, as your little sister..."
MID_WU_S_1_WAKEUP_#006,I'm going to make sure I protect you!
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#001,Morning!
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#002,"I have an idea. Next time, you should come 
wake me up!"
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#003,"It'd be really easy, you know."
MID_WU_S_2_HELLO_#004,"I'd be so happy to see you, I'd jump right 
out of bed!"
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#001,Your sister's here to wake you up!
MID_WU_S_2_IN_#002,"""Your sister"" Ooo, I love getting to say 
that, hehe."
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#001,I'm sorry for this silly grin.
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#002,I'm just so happy!
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#003,"I've found my sibling, my best friend... 
my family!"
MID_WU_S_2_SOON_#004,Thanks for giving me so many reasons to smile.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#001,"So, you're keeping the stone I gave you here."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#002,I wonder if you'll be able to use it one day.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#003,"Maybe it could help you become a snow 
white dragon, just like Lumera."
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#004,I want to be a righteous dragon one day.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#005,No...I will become one.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#006,My soul has changed even if my blood hasn't.
MID_WU_S_2_WAKEUP_#007,It was you who taught me that.
