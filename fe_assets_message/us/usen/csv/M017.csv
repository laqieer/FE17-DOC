Along with every other move we've made."

The other Veyle?"

carry on his legacy."

Dragon powers. Wished for peace. Hmph."

Wh...what adjustments?"
MID_OP2_#047,"[Alear] 
What did you do to her?"

draconic impulses the teensiest bit."

You embodied Lord Sombron's will."

the Corrupted across Elyos...all your doing."
MID_OP2_#051,"[Veyle] 
That's... That's why I kept waking up in places 
I didn't recognize..."

Yes. As your consciousness slept, the other 
was awake, carrying out her work."

you had created!"
MID_OP2_#054,"But it gets better. The Fell Dragon's daughter, 
and the Divine Dragon...became friends!"
