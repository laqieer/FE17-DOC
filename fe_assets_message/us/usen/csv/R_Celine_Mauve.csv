[Céline] 
Mauvier, why did you abandon our search for 
the place from your childhood?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Princess Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
I am sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
I should explain myself since it was your help 
that solved my dilemma."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Céline] 
I won't pry if it's a sensitive subject. I was 
merely curious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Mauvier] 
Not at all. You see, I was certain that, with your 
help, I could find the hilltop from my memories."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Mauvier] 
Then I came to a realization."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Mauvier] 
My memories are not special because of the 
beauty of the place."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Mauvier] 
I remember that hill and its lone broadleaf tree 
because of the happy times with my family."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Céline] 
Ah, I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Mauvier] 
My mother's smile. My father tousling my hair. 
We would talk, laugh, and enjoy life together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Mauvier] 
And the meat pies, oh, they were my favorite. 
I knew only happiness during those picnic days."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Céline] 
Oh, Mauvier..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Mauvier] 
I realize now that I would not be so moved 
were I to find that hillside today."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Mauvier] 
My parents are long departed from this world. 
With them gone, that hill is only a hill."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Céline] 
I propose that we keep searching for that place."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Mauvier] 
Pardon?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Céline] 
Your family may be gone, but I think we might 
all enjoy spending time there together with you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Mauvier] 
Princess Céline..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Mauvier] 
That is a generous offer, and I accept. Both your 
help and your company are most welcome."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Céline] 
It would be my pleasure."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Céline] 
Let us locate the site that you may form new 
and joyous memories there with your friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Mauvier] 
Thank you, Princess Céline."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 

[Céline] 
Does this one stir anything?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Mauvier] 
Hmm... No. It is unfamiliar."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Céline] 
How about this one, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Mauvier] 
No, I do not recognize that scene either."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Céline] 
Drat. These are all the paintings I have of 
famous landscapes around Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Céline] 
Yet none of them appear to be the place you 
remember so keenly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Mauvier] 
I am sorry. You took the time to procure these, 
but they stir no memories."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Céline] 
Is there anything else about this place, other 
than the scenery, that you can recall?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Mauvier] 
Hm..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Mauvier] 
I remember now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Mauvier] 
Meat pies. My mother would make them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Mauvier] 
My parents and I would picnic beneath the 
broadleaf tree and take in the scenery."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Mauvier] 
Those pies were wonderful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Céline] 
Heh heh, what a delightful thing to recall."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Mauvier] 
I'm sorry. I know none of that story helps to 
find the location I seek."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Céline] 
Never mind that. It must have been a joyous 
time for you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Mauvier] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Mauvier] 
Oh. I think I understand now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Mauvier] 
For all this time..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Céline] 
Mauvier? Is something amiss?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Mauvier] 
Princess Céline, you have been a tremendous 
help to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Mauvier] 
I have all the information I need. 
Thank you again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Mauvier] 

[Céline] 
Ah, Mauvier, wait!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Céline] 
What brought that on, I wonder?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Mauvier] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Princess Céline, may I ask you something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Céline] 
You may."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Mauvier] 
Are you aware of a hill in Firene where a 
lone broadleaf tree stands?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Céline] 
A lone, broadleaf tree? None spring to mind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Céline] 
Why do you ask?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Mauvier] 
I do not know if you are aware, but I was born 
in Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Mauvier] 
Throughout my childhood, my family would 
travel to that hillside."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Mauvier] 
The name of the region eludes me, but I will 
always remember the beauty of that scenery."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Mauvier] 
I wish to visit that place again, if I can."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Céline] 
My goodness. I had no idea that you hailed 
from Firene."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Céline] 
But you've given me little to go on when it 
comes to the site in question."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Mauvier] 
I apologize. I realize now how little information 
I have to offer for the search."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Mauvier] 
I have wonderful memories of my days there. 
Sometimes, I can almost smell the air."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Céline] 
You carry a profound emotional attachment to 
this place, don't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Céline] 
Very well. I cannot abandon the plight of a 
native Firenese friend so easily."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Céline] 
I shall do what I can to help you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Céline] 
As princess of Firene, I vow to find this place 
from your memories."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Mauvier] 
Thank you, Princess Céline."
