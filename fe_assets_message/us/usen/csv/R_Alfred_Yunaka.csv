[Yunaka] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Golly, that's weird to think about..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
What is?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
Where I'd be if I hadn't heard Micaiah's voice 
in that ring. I wouldn't be here at all, would I?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
It's kind of unnerving to think this great change 
in my life hinged completely on a coincidence."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alfred] 
Nah. It's no coincidence that you're one of 
us now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alfred] 
It's just you being you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Yunaka] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alfred] 
You're here because you wanted Micaiah's wish 
to come true."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alfred] 
Thanks to your big heart, we're allies now. 
I'm glad to have you on the team!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Yunaka] 
Aww... Shuckers, Alfred!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Yunaka] 
You're the one with the big heart, though. 
Honestly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Yunaka] 
Compared to you...I'm a coward."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Yunaka] 
I've hidden who I really am, all the things I've 
done, just for the chance to belong here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Yunaka] 
If you knew the whole truth about me, I'd have 
so much more to worry about."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Yunaka] 
I think you'd do more than merely despise me. 
I think you'd actually come after me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alfred] 
Hmm...no. No, I wouldn't."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Yunaka] 
What do you mean you wouldn't?! You can't 
just say you wouldn't!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Yunaka] 
I've been filling your head with weapon facts! 
You barely know a thing about me!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Yunaka] 
You can't accept me for who I am without even 
knowing who that is! It's not right... It's unfair."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alfred] 
Let it be unfair, then. I'm fine with that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alfred] 
I'm fine not knowing your past too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alfred] 
I trust you, Yunaka. I always will."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Yunaka] 
Come on, Alfred..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alfred] 
I don't have to explain why I trust you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alfred] 
Just like you don't have to prove that I should 
trust you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Yunaka] 
You are...so weird."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Yunaka] 
I mean, I know I'm bizarre, but you're a whole 
new breed of bird."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alfred] 
Hahaha, you got me there!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Alfred] 
From one weird bird to another, I hope we stay 
friends for a long time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Yunaka] 
Me too."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 
[Alfred] 
So, where are you from?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Ooo, look at you! Shootin' off questions like 
barbed arrows outta camouflage!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Yunaka] 
Set an ambush like that and you're liable to 
drag a straight answer out of me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alfred] 
Great! So let's have it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Yunaka] 
Uh... Dang..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Yunaka] 
Somewhere in, uh...Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alfred] 
Oh, I see. Thanks for opening up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Yunaka] 
Listen, could I ask you to keep a lid and, like, 
eight padlocks on this particular jar?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Yunaka] 
Things could get unpleasant for me if this gets 
out and folks start connecting dots."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alfred] 
Gotcha. My lips are sealed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Thanks, Alfred. Look, I know you want us to 
talk more, but it's not quite that simple."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Yunaka] 
It could get really bad for both of us if you ask 
me the wrong kinds of questions."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alfred] 
Oh, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Yunaka] 
I've got a lot to hide."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Yunaka] 
And I don't want to lie to you, but if you put me 
in that position then I absolutely will."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Yunaka] 
Because it's far preferable to the trouble that 
could find you if you learn too much about me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Yunaka] 
I'm sorry that's how it has to be, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alfred] 
No, no. I get it. I won't push you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Alfred] 
I'm not out to make you uncomfortable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Yunaka] 
I appreciate that, Alfred. Truly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alfred] 
But I said last time I wanted to talk more with 
you, and that's what I'm gonna do."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Alfred] 
It doesn't have to be personal stuff. We can talk 
about anything. Like our favorite flowers!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Yunaka] 
Yes! Love it! Henceforth, your brain's gonna 
be stuffed with obscure weapon factoids!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Ooo, look what I found! It's an Alfred! Fancy 
meeting one of those in a place like this!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alfred] 
Hey, Yunaka! You, uh, settling in OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Yunaka] 
Abso-totely! Everyone's been a tasty treat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Yunaka] 
If anything, the welcome's been almost a little 
too warm, y'know?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Yunaka] 
I'm an unknown quantity. I could be anybody! 
What if I was a somebody? Who would know?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Yunaka] 
It's weirdly convenient no one's been checking 
on me to try to find out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alfred] 
Oh. Should I be snooping more?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Yunaka] 
Seems like a logical course of action, that's all 
I'm saying."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alfred] 
Well, I do wanna get to know you better."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Alfred] 
So yeah. We should talk more, when we get 
the time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Talk? Is that your idea of gathering intel? 
Are you really gonna go that easy on me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Yunaka] 
Think about it, chum! I could be an enemy spy!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alfred] 
Probably not, though. I trust you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Yunaka] 
Forsooth, silly lad! Whence comes this 
unearned confidence?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Yunaka] 
Have you never once been betrayed? Swindled? 
Double-crossed? Bamboozled?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alfred] 
Haha, I get that question a lot!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Yunaka] 
Gets that question a lot, he says! Not a bit of 
self-awareness on this guy!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Yunaka] 
I don't get you, Alfred. But maybe I shouldn't 
look this gift knife in the serrated bevel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Yunaka] 
If you trust me, I appreciate it. Thanks."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Alfred] 
Anytime, Yunaka!"
