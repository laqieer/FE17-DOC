[Alear] 
Thank you for the chat the other day, Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Exactly what I was going to say! After our talk, 
I feel our bond has become unbreakable."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
To tell the truth, however, I was rather reluctant 
to speak too much of my homeland."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Why is that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
You said my family back home would be 
proud of me..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
Yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
Those were kind words, but...they were untrue."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
I abandoned my responsibility and my role. 
I left only written words to explain my leaving."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
Are there any parents who would look proudly 
on their son for this? I think it is impossible."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps they have forgotten me altogether."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alear] 
Oh, Kagetsu..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
That just means we have our work cut out 
for us, doesn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alear] 
If you accomplish great things, your family 
can't help but be proud of you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
So you'll just have to become a living legend 
across the land. Nothing to it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alear] 
They can't forget you if your name is on the lips 
of all the world. And as your friend, I'll help you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
My friend, the Divine One..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
I had thought one meeting was enough to 
become friends. I now realize it is not so simple."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
True. Friends are much more than that. They 
help each other through their darkest moments."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
If that is the case, then our bond of friendship 
has grown incredibly strong!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
You think so?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes! We were friends from the start, but our 
bond has grown much stronger over time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alear] 
That's true. It certainly has."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Kagetsu] 
Indeed. And thanks to that powerful bond, word 
of our great deeds will be spread far and wide!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Your hair, Divine One─is your style unique, or 
is it common to all dragon fashion?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alear] 
Now that you mention it, I have no idea. I don't 
actually know much about dragons."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
It seems they are mysteries even to themselves."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
I apologize. You have so many questions, and I 
have so few answers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Not at all! I am happy merely to talk with you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
In my homeland, it is the Dragons of the East 
who are worshipped, rather than Divine or Fell."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
That is why I find you so very interesting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
I had no idea your people worshipped the 
Dragons of the East!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
I'd love to know more about your homeland. 
What's it like?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
It is part of the queendom of Solm, but remote. 
There is not much contact with other regions."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
Our culture is unique and vibrant. But we are 
quite secluded."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alear] 
Is that because your people want to protect 
their culture from outside influences?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps, yes. But they also lock it away!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
I may not seem it, but I was born to royalty. 
I was trained always to preserve my legacy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
That meant always being home, thinking only of 
family. It was sad, never to step outside of that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alear] 
But now you fight with us for a cause you 
believe in!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I'm sure your family is proud of you and the 
difference you're making in the world."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
Maybe so."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Kagetsu] 
Did you have any other questions for me? I am 
happy to answer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alear] 
Oh, I sure do. We haven't even discussed the 
food in your homeland yet!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Divine One! Divine One!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Since you appear human, I am curious─what 
are the differences between dragon and human?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
Let's see... We live a bit longer than humans, 
we're typically stronger and more agile..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
You're right about appearance, though─we look 
much the same."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Interesting! Is it also true that you slumbered in 
the Somniel for one thousand years?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
What was it that woke you, after all that time? 
Did you tire of sleeping?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
To be honest, I'm not sure."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
I see. And what were you doing before you 
went to sleep?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
I'm sorry. I don't remember much from before 
I woke up..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Kagetsu] 
Hm... A pity."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
You're asking lots of questions, Kagetsu. 
Why are you so interested in me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
Why should I not be? We are friends, of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
Friends? We've actually not spoken that much..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
To my mind, we have been friends ever since 
we first spoke. And I like to know my friends!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
Is it not so for you? Do you not want to be 
my friend?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
No, of course I do!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
Good! Then I would like to know all about you, 
so we can strengthen our bond."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alear] 
So I should get comfortable and brace for more 
questions. Got it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
You seem to be deep in thought, Kagetsu. 
What's on your mind?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
Divine One... I fear that our bond of friendship 
has weakened."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
Did I do something wrong? I'm so sorry! 
How can I make it up to you?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
No─it is my fault."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
I understand you now have this Pact Ring, 
which you will give to your cherished partner."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
I wish to be happy for this person, but however 
much I try to suppress it, I feel only jealousy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
Your bond with your partner will be stronger 
than any bond of friendship."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
I cannot bear to be happy for you because I find 
myself only wishing that were me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Alear] 
Kagetsu..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
That is why I say our bond has weakened. It is 
because of my selfish jealousy."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
Kagetsu."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
You're being silly."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
No! I am being serious!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
I mean it's silly for you to fret. I was already 
planning on giving this to you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
The Pact Ring. Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
Because I want you to be my cherished partner."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
You do? Truly?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
Our bond is more powerful than any friendship. 
I would never lie to you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
Our feelings are identical? Yes! I am so happy!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
Haha! I have never had greater happiness in all 
my life! Thank you! Thank you!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
Hehe! No, thank you, Kagetsu!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Kagetsu] 
First friends, now partners. I think this bond 
was meant to be. What is next for us, I wonder?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Alear] 
Family, perhaps? At the very least, I'd love 
to meet yours."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Kagetsu] 
Very well. Once I am ready to return home, 
I will take you with me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Kagetsu] 
Until then, , I will work hard 
to make you proud of me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Kagetsu] 
And as your partner, I will devote my life to 
bringing you happiness. Because I love you!"
