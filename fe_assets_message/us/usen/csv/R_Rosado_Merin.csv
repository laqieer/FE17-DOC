MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Merrin] 
Rosado, I think I finally figured something out."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
We've been at these cool-vs-cute-offs for a 
while now, and we still can't declare a winner."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Rosado] 
Agreed. There's no resolving this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Rosado] 
You've won me over with every single cool 
thing you've brought."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Merrin] 
The same goes for me. I've adored every single 
cute thing you've shown me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Rosado] 
There's only one thing we can say for sure. 
Coolness and cuteness...are both amazing!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Merrin] 
Yes! It doesn't matter which one wins. What 
matters is both are great!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Merrin] 
I'm sorry I dragged this ridiculous competition 
on for so long."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Rosado] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Rosado] 
It was totally worth the effort. Now we know 
that coolness and cuteness measure up equally!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Merrin] 
Hold on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Rosado] 
What is it, Merrin?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Merrin] 
You were very cool just now, Rosado. Many 
times cooler than I've been lately."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Rosado] 
Ah... I could say the same about you, y'know. 
But with your cuteness!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Rosado] 
Your satisfied smile every time you got me... 
That was so beyond cute."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Merrin] 
Haha. Thanks, Rosado."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Merrin] 
So, how about this... Let's just keep mastering 
our own, individual, equally amazing styles."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Rosado] 
I like it. You continue to be the genius of cool, 
and I'll keep aspiring to greater heights of cute."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Merrin] 
We can be rivals and we can walk different 
paths, and we can still cheer each other on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Rosado] 
Heh, yes! Rosado and Merrin, best foes forever!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
The battle to determine the superior style, 
cool or cute, cute or cool..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Merrin] 
It's on, Rosado. You ready?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Rosado] 
You bet I am. This is the moment your heart 
is stolen away forever, Merrin."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Merrin] 
Hit me with whatever cute object you brought. 
I'm ready!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Rosado] 
Feast your eyes...on THIS!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Merrin] 
What's that...a drawing of some sort?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Rosado] 
Oh, no, no, no. Take a closer look."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Rosado] 
This is a drawing, to scale, of none other than 
the northern Elusian miniature woolly hare."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Merrin] 
What?! No!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Merrin] 
The northern Elusian miniature woolly hare is so 
tiny and so fluffy and sooo adorable! Look at it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Rosado] 
Mhm! I happened to come across the little one, 
so of course I took the chance and sketched."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Merrin] 
And in such detail! Ugh... You know how much 
I adore rare creatures!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Merrin] 
I hate to admit it, Rosado... Your cute drawing 
has captivated my heart."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Rosado] 
Looks like I win the day!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Merrin] 
Not so fast. You haven't seen what I brought."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Merrin] 
It's an ornamental hair pin. And there, inlaid 
among the filigree, is a detailed wyvern design!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Rosado] 
Oh no. Oh no! Aaah, it's the coolest thing I've 
ever seen!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Merrin] 
I know what a big wyvern fan you are. 
Your heart didn't stand a chance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Merrin] 
I mean, look! Each and every one of its fangs 
has been painstakingly crafted."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Rosado] 
The craftsmanship is over-the-top magical! 
And over-the-top cool!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Merrin] 
Ugh... Cool!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Rosado] 
Aw... Cute!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Merrin] 
This contest..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Rosado] 
Is a stalemate!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Merrin] 2 
[Merrin] 
Ah, Rosado. This was always meant to be 
our fate."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Rosado] 
I know. This had to happen."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Rosado] 
The last thing I want to do is fight a friend, but 
our destiny is inescapable."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Merrin] 
Agreed. We have no choice but to battle it out 
here and now, fair and square!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Merrin] 
Let's do this!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Rosado] 
Cool versus cute!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Merrin] 
The superior style wins!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Rosado] 
You're a devoted student of cool, while I've 
dedicated my life to the pursuit of cute."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Merrin] 
A twist of fate brought us together, and now 
it's up to us to decide which force is stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Merrin] 
So, here's what we're going to do..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Merrin] 
You find the cutest object you can. I find the 
coolest object I can. Then...the big reveal!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Merrin] 
We show these objects to one another, and 
whoever's heart is most captivated...loses!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Rosado] 
You're on. I'm going to bring something so 
cute your heart will explode!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Merrin] 
Do your worst. Whatever incredibly cool object 
I bring...it's going to...blow your mind!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Rosado] 
With that out of the way, let the captivation 
competition commence!"
