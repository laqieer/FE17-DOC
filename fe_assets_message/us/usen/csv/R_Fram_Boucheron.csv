[Boucheron] 
Framme? I have a gift for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Framme] 
For me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Here. I think you'll like it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Framme] 
Huh. Is this another book you want me to read?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Boucheron] 
Just open it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Framme] 
OK..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Framme] 
Wait a second."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Framme] 
There aren't any words in here. It's blank!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Boucheron] 
That's right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Framme] 
Boucheron, is this some kind of prank?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Boucheron] 
No, no. There's a good reason why this book 
is blank."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Boucheron] 
It's so you can write your own story."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Framme] 
Write? Me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Yes. Since there aren't many books that interest 
you, I thought you might like writing better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Framme] 
There's no way I could write a whole book on 
my own."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Boucheron] 
You don't need to write a good story. You could 
use it like a journal instead, if you want."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Boucheron] 
I just think it'll be easier for you to read 
something you wrote yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Framme] 
Hm..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Framme] 
All right, then. To start off, I'll write about the 
day we met."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Boucheron] 
Of all places, that's where you're going 
to begin?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Framme] 
Sure! I thought it was a sweet moment."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Boucheron] 
What, with me bawling?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Framme] 
Trust me, it was memorable. I can still picture 
every last tear rolling down your face."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Boucheron] 
Hm-hm, well... So long as you let me read it for 
myself someday."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Framme] 
Deal. As soon as it's done, you'll be the first 
to lay eyes on my masterpiece."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Framme] 
Watch out, though. Gonna be a real tearjerker!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Boucheron] 
I'll keep my hankie dry just in case."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Framme] 1

[Boucheron] 
""And with that, the long war was over. The two 
siblings would know peace at last."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
""There would be time for them to live simply 
and happily, and with each other. The end."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Framme] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Framme] 
WAAAAAH!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Framme] 
They finally...got reunited! Thank GOODNESS!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Boucheron] 
I know! It's a relief, isn't it? I'm getting misty- 
eyed again just thinking about it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Framme] 
To be honest...you were crying so hard, 
I...missed some of the middle parts."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Framme] 
But still─so good!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Boucheron] 
That's great! I knew you'd love it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Framme] 
I totally get now why you cry at books."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Framme] 
Who knew they could be so...beautiful? I've only 
read the boring ones, I guess."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Boucheron] 
Well, there's a wide world of captivating ones 
out there if you're interested."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Boucheron] 
If you liked what we just read, I can recommend 
something. It's set at an officers academy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Boucheron] 
The series is famous for its political intrigue and 
deep characters. It's up to 30 volumes now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Framme] 
Wow. That's a lot."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Boucheron] 
I'd love to discuss it with you once you finish 
the whole set."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Framme] 
Hm... I don't think I can get through 30 books 
on my own."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Framme] 
But I can't have you read all that to me, 
obviously. So...don't hold your breath, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Framme] 
I'm just a really slow reader. I wouldn't want 
to keep you waiting."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Boucheron] 
Oh...OK. If that's what you think best."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Framme] 
Anyway, thanks! You definitely showed me how 
interesting books can be."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Boucheron] 
Good. I'm glad to have shown you the light."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Why? Why would they do such a thing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
It's just...not fair!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Framme] 1 
[Framme] 
Hey. Boucheron, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Yes. And you're...Framme, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Boucheron] 
What...what is it? Do you...need me 
for something?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Framme] 
Um, no. I'm fine."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Framme] 
I heard somebody crying their eyes out and 
I got concerned, is all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Boucheron] 
Ah. Right. Sorry for worrying you. I'm all right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Framme] 
OK... But then what's with the sobbing?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Boucheron] 
I was reading this book, and I just get so swept 
up in the story."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Framme] 
A book did this to you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Boucheron] 
People tell me I cry too easily. The littlest thing 
is enough to set me off."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Framme] 
OK, I gotcha. So what's this book about?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Well, there are these siblings who are separated 
during a war and later meet again as enemies."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Framme] 
Huh. Sounds interesting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Boucheron] 
I'd be happy to lend it to you after I'm finished."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Framme] 
Thanks for the offer, but I'll pass. I don't really... 
Well, I'm not a big reader."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Boucheron] 
Oh, now that's a shame."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Boucheron] 
Ah! What if I read it to you instead?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Framme] 
What?! That's sweet and all, but I couldn't ask 
you to read to me like a little kid."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Boucheron] 
Think nothing of it. I know you'd love the story 
just as much as I do."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Framme] 
In that case... Sure! Why not?"
