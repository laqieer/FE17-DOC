[Céline] 
This tea has a lovely fragrance. And a stirring 
taste, as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
I agree! The tea leaves are from the Brodian 
highlands. They're said to be a potent sleep aid."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Céline] 
Truly?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Céline] 
Oh... You prepared this just for me, didn't you? 
I'm touched."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alcryst] 
How have your dreams been lately?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Céline] 
No better, I'm afraid. As the war intensifies, 
so too do my nightmares."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alcryst] 
I'm so sorry to hear that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alcryst] 
You know...I don't think either of us will ever 
rule our countries."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Céline] 
I beg your pardon?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Ah, that came out wrong. I meant that, should 
the worst happen, we'd do our duties, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alcryst] 
The worst isn't going to happen. We'll fight to 
protect them─our brothers, our future kings."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alcryst] 
Fear may persist in our dreams, but we won't 
let it affect our realities."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alcryst] 
In fact, I'll go a step further...and do my best to 
protect Prince Alfred as well!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Céline] 
Oh!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alcryst] 
He's the crown prince of an allied kingdom, 
so I consider him to be my brother too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alcryst] 
Oh, wait... He might be annoyed if a weakling 
like me were to offer protection as a brother."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Céline] 
Don't be silly! Alfred would be overjoyed. 
I know I am. It's enough to bring me to tears."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Céline] 
It's very reassuring to know someone so skilled 
as you will be watching over him."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Oh. I...appreciate that you think so highly of me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Céline] 
I, in turn, will safeguard your brother, the 
crown prince Diamant."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Céline] 
Working together to protect the future kings 
will benefit both our nations."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Céline] 
I would go so far to risk my own life for them, 
if needed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alcryst] 
Princess Céline! That's not─"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Céline] 
It isn't the normal order of things. I am aware. 
And yet..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Céline] 
I suspect you would do the same, yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Alcryst] 
Hm..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Alcryst] 
You're right of course, but...we should probably 
keep this agreement a secret."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Céline] 
Yes, indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Alcryst] 
I believe we just formed an alliance that would 
worry most of our friends and allies."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Céline] 
Yet I think that because of it, my nightmares 
will plague me less frequently."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Alcryst] 
I think that might be true for me as well."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Alcryst] 
We may never bear our own crowns, but we can 
certainly bear each other's burdens."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#034,"[Céline] 
Yes. Even after the war ends, may we always 
act in harmony for the sake of our nations."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Another bad dream, Princess Céline?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Céline] 
Hah... Is it so obvious?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Céline] 
As I recall, you've also had dreams of losing 
your brother, haven't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Céline] 
I'm curious... When did they start for you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alcryst] 
Only recently, shortly after we entered this 
war against the Fell Dragon."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alcryst] 
My father told me, ""If your brother and I both 
die, it will fall to you to protect our kingdom."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alcryst] 
I thought that sounded impossible at the time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alcryst] 
My mighty father and invincible older brother... 
die in battle? How ridiculous."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alcryst] 
But wars are often...unpredictable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Céline] 
I know what you mean."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alcryst] 
Now I'm haunted by a growing fear that my bad 
dreams might become reality."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alcryst] 
What if an enemy catches him off guard? What 
if we're separated and I never find him again?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alcryst] 
I've lost count of all the horrible ways my 
dreams have taken Diamant from me..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Céline] 
My experience has been similar. In my dreams, 
every disaster I can think of comes to pass."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Now, after every nightmare, I crawl out of bed 
and check on him as he sleeps."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alcryst] 
Seeing him sprawled out, snoring louder than 
the sawing of a log... That puts my fears to rest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Céline] 
I'm glad you have that, at least."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Céline] 
My brother is too much of an early riser for me 
to do the same. I'd be roped into his workouts."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Heh... Funny, I'd imagine that seeing him up 
and running in circles would be a relief."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Céline] 
Heh heh, it does help, I admit."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Céline] 
Well! Speaking with you has calmed my nerves. 
I am sorry for worrying you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alcryst] 
Not at all. If you have another bad dream and 
want to talk about it, I'm always here."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alcryst] 
I can't make them go away, but...at the very 
least, you know you're not alone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Céline] 
Thank you, Prince Alcryst. I find that very 
reassuring."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alcryst] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Princess Céline? You're up rather late. 
Is something the matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Céline] 
Oh, Prince Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Céline] 
It's nothing. My sleep was restless tonight, 
that's all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alcryst] 
Ah. Did you have a bad dream?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Céline] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Céline] 
I dreamt my brother died."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alcryst] 
Oh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Céline] 
This is a recurring dream, mind you. One that 
I have had many times since childhood."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Céline] 
My brother used to be chronically ill, you see."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Céline] 
But even now, I can't shake the feeling that he 
might be taken from me at any moment."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alcryst] 
Oh, Princess Céline..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Céline] 
Alfred has recovered since then, make no 
mistake. He is the picture of robust health now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alcryst] 
That he is. He always seems so brave on the 
battlefield. It's amazing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Alcryst] 
For what it's worth, I have those same bad 
dreams myself..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Dreams where my brother Diamant is taken 
from me, that is."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Céline] 
Oh! Do you now?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alcryst] 
I do. They're a bit grim, so I've never discussed 
them with anyone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Céline] 
I see. I should like to hear more about them, 
if you are willing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Céline] 
But the hour is far too late for that, I think. 
Another time, Prince Alcryst?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Alcryst] 
Of course. I'm free to talk whenever you need 
a sympathetic ear."
