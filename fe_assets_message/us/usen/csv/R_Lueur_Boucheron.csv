[Boucheron] 
I feel just terrible about the other day, 
Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
I hope my poor sense of direction didn't stress 
you out even more."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
I wouldn't worry too much. We got home safely, 
and the whole thing was even kind of fun."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Whew. That does make me feel better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
So, how else do you relieve stress?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Boucheron] 
I do enjoy a good book. Diving into a whole 
other world helps me forget about ours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Boucheron] 
I highly recommend this─it's a classic from my 
homeland called, ""Love in Bloom."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
It's very...damp. And wrinkled."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Boucheron] 
Oh, sorry about that. It's from tears."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
Excuse me?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Boucheron] 
It doesn't take much to get the waterworks 
going for me. That's why, uh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Boucheron] 
That's why I get misty just looking at the cover 
for this one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alear] 
That's all it takes?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Don't be fooled. Reading really is very relaxing. 
And this is one of my favorites."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
All right, then... Let's see here..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Boucheron] 
Wait! I'm going to need a moment after 
seeing the table of contents..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
Is this for real?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Boucheron] 
I'm sorry, Divine One... This can't be very 
relaxing. I'll leave you alone with the book."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
Are you sure? I really don't mind."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
Besides, I think people would start to worry if 
they saw you walking around in tears."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Boucheron] 
Uwah... Oh, Divine One, you're too kind! Wait 
until we get to the introductory paragraph..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alear] 
At this rate, we'll finish the war before the 
first chapter..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Boucheron] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
How are you liking this mountain air, 
Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
It's so clear. Everything about this place 
is gorgeous."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Alear] 
Just standing here is doing a lot to clear 
my mind."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Boucheron] 
I'm glad it's working as intended."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
Is this the stream you mentioned before?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Boucheron] 
Yes. Well, probably. It's got to be one of the 
ones around here. I think."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alear] 
You sound...less than sure."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Boucheron] 
It's this terrible sense of direction I have."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Boucheron] 
I've tried to visit the same spot twice, but I've 
never had any luck."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alear] 
Now you tell me..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Boucheron] 
What's the matter? You seem worried."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
I'm suddenly wondering if we're going to be 
able to find our way home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Haha, don't worry about that. I've been 
breaking tree branches to mark our path."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Look over there. See that broken branch? 
It shows we came...that way..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Boucheron] 
Huh? Aww..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I'm not seeing it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Boucheron] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Boucheron] 
I could swear I broke that branch!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alear] 
Um, which one?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Boucheron] 
What? None of these branches are broken! 
I am so sorry, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Boucheron] 
But I think it'll be OK. Let's try going in 
this direction!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alear] 
Actually, let's head the other way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Boucheron] 
What? Why?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Alear] 
If your sense of direction is that bad, we should 
do the opposite of whatever your instinct says."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Boucheron] 
Hm, fair point! Haha, off we go!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Boucheron] 2 

[Boucheron] 
Are you all right there, Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Boucheron? Why do you ask?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Oh, I just thought you seemed a little worn out."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Alear] 
Ouch, you noticed? I am feeling sort of sluggish."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Boucheron] 
Hm, that's not good. You're eating three meals 
a day, I hope?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alear] 
Yes. I don't think my diet is the issue."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Boucheron] 
Well then, how about your sleep?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alear] 
About the usual."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Boucheron] 
Hmm... So you're eating and sleeping fine, but 
you still feel groggy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Boucheron] 
It could be stress."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
You think so?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Boucheron] 
I wouldn't be surprised. Going to war is 
stressful for anyone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Boucheron] 
What have you been doing as stress relief?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
Nothing. It hadn't even occurred to me. Why, 
what do you do?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Boucheron] 
I have several ways to blow off steam."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Boucheron] 
Like going up a mountain alone and spending 
some quiet time fishing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Alear] 
Wow. That does sound relaxing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Boucheron] 
Would you like to join me sometime? The 
""alone"" part of it is optional, really."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alear] 
Yes! I would love that. Please come get me the 
next time you head out!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Boucheron] 2 

[Boucheron] 
You called, Divine One? Is everything all right?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
Hello, Boucheron. I've been thinking about your 
stress-relief tips."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
But the reason I called you here is for 
something else altogether."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
You're here so I can tell you three things."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Alear] 
First, I'd like to thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Alear] 
I hope you know that your unwavering support 
is always appreciated."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Boucheron] 
Please, think nothing of it. I'm just happy I can 
help you in some way."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
I must say, your dedication is very charming. 
As is your humility."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Boucheron] 
You think I'm charming?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Alear] 
Yes. That was actually the second thing I 
wanted to tell you, so...there it is."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Alear] 
But there's one last thing I have to get off my 
chest. Here goes..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Alear] 
Sorry, I'm just...feeling a little emotional 
about this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
What's the matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Boucheron] 
I can't watch you get so emotional without 
getting all choked up myself."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
That's the kind of all-out supportiveness that 
I think makes me like you so much."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Boucheron] 
Hm?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
Boucheron, will you take the Pact Ring and 
promise to stay with me?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
I think we have something special, and I'd hate 
to lose that after the war."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Boucheron] 
You─ You mean it? Oh, Divine One, I'm so 
happy right now I could cry."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Boucheron] 
But no, I've gotta keep it together long enough 
to tell you this."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Boucheron] 
I'm no royal or steward, just an ordinary knight. 
But I've always held you in high esteem."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
Is that a yes, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Boucheron] 
Of course I'll take the ring. It's proof that we're 
of the same mind about each other."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Boucheron] 
If you'd have me, I'd follow you to the ends 
of the earth."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Boucheron. This is cause for 
celebration."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Boucheron] 
Haha, you took the words right out of 
my mouth."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Boucheron] 
I may get lost in life and feel emotional, but I'll 
always find my way with you, ."
