[Rosado] 
Hey, Louis. Hold still a sec, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Louis] 
Paper and ink? Are you drawing a picture?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Louis] 
As I recall, you have a knack for drawing 
landscapes with both speed and skill."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Rosado] 
Yup! My not-so-hidden talent."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Louis] 
But what is your subject here? The scenery 
around us is somewhat drab."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Rosado] 
You, silly! I'm gonna draw you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Rosado] 
I want a picture of you and me together. 
I'll add myself later."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Louis] 
But wouldn't a simple self-portrait be much 
more attractive on balance? I should think so."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Rosado] 
Maybe, but that's not what I'm going for. My 
own cuteness isn't important for this one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Louis] 
I beg your pardon?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Rosado] 
I want a picture with you, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Rosado] 
I want a way to remember my friend when he's 
not around."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Louis] 
Why, Rosado. How sweet of you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Rosado] 
Hehe, I try."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Louis] 
Would you mind if I wore a mask?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Rosado] 
A mask?! Just because it's not all about looks 
doesn't mean I don't want to draw your face!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Louis] 
It was only a suggestion."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Rosado] 
Keep your suggestions to yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Rosado] 
Everyone else blushes and does what I say. 
Why are you the difficult one?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Louis] 
Forgive me. I'm happy to be a part of your art, 
of course, but it's also a bit embarrassing."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Louis] 
I'm not, um...cute."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Rosado] 
Let me stop you there. You're absolutely cute. 
Especially when you're embarrassed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Rosado] 
This is just a little memento for us to look back 
on, that's all. If you don't want it, that's fine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Rosado] 
But picture me, years from now, an old man─ 
desperate to remember my dear friend Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Louis] 
Very well. For the sake of my friend and his 
passion, I shall accept my fate."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Rosado] 
Thank you! OK, hold still a minute. This won't 
take long."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Rosado] 
Someday we'll want to look back on this 
moment. Now we'll have the perfect visual aid!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Louis] 
If I must endure this to commemorate our 
friendship, then I shall do so gladly."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Rosado] 2 

[Rosado] 
Really? You don't think they're cute?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Louis] 
Don't test me, Rosado. I will never bend on this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Rosado] 
Look closer. Not even a little?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Louis] 
Not in the least. They contain not a single iota 
of cuteness."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Rosado] 
Weird! I know you like grapes, so I thought 
you'd like these little guys too."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Rosado] 
I guess sea grapes aren't for everyone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Louis] 
They are also seaweed─not grapes! They are 
vile pretenders to the name. I despise them."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Louis] 
They resemble real grapes, but they are salty, 
and after eating them, so was my language."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Rosado] 
Huh. Well, I like 'em."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Rosado] 
They're like cute little balls of ocean─they 
taste like the sea!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Louis] 
I-is that so? My apologies, then."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Rosado] 
What are you apologizing for?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Louis] 
I try to appreciate the things my friends like, 
to the extent that I can."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Louis] 
However, I draw the line at sea grapes!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Rosado] 
Haha, it's fine, Louis! We can like different 
things and still remain friends."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Louis] 
Truly? Then would you object if I continue to 
observe you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Louis] 
I should hate to abandon the sight of my dear 
Rosado going about his day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Rosado] 
Of course! Get ready to burn the image of my 
cuteness straight into your eyes!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Louis] 
Consider it burned!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Rosado] 2 

[Rosado] 
What's the matter, Louis? Can't take your eyes 
off me?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Louis] 
Indeed, Rosado. I find you positively enchanting."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Rosado] 
Wait, really?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Louis] 
In every movement and speech, you are a 
fountain of energy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Louis] 
To my eye, it is sublime."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Rosado] 
Hahaha! I was teasing, but I love your honesty!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Rosado] 
I thought you were mainly interested in seeing 
people socialize, though."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Rosado] 
Is it the same thing to watch me without 
anyone else around?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Louis] 
It's not so different."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Louis] 
Some people display boundless reserves of 
energy even when alone."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Louis] 
When you spot a puppy gamboling in the road, 
is it a lesser sight for having no playmate?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Rosado] 
No, of course not."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Louis] 
I rest my case."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Rosado] 
You're a fascinating guy, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Rosado] 
We never talked much before, but now I really 
wanna get to know you!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Louis] 
And I you, Rosado."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Louis] 
To that end, why don't you join me for tea? 
I could serve it in a very charming tea set."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Rosado] 
Amazing. Let's go!"
