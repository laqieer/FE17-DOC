[Yunaka] 
Oooh, what a peaceful field! I feel like I could 
flop over and nap for a thousand years."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Etie] 
This is my secret spot. I come here alone 
sometimes to goof off."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
Not sure I'd take you for the flower-loving type."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Etie] 
I grew up in a pretty flower-heavy town, so it 
cheers me up being surrounded by them."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Yunaka] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Yunaka] 
That's really beautiful."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Etie] 
What is?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Yunaka] 
Growing up surrounded by flowers. Memories 
to cheer you up. I'm a little jealous, honestly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Yunaka] 
My life as a kid wasn't anything like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Etie] 
No?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Yunaka] 
No, but I wish it had been. A life like yours... 
It would've been a dream."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Etie] 
Poor Yunaka..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Yunaka] 
Kidding! You should've seen your face."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Etie] 
I can't even begin to imagine the kind of life 
you must have lived."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Etie] 
Your muscles tell a pretty harrowing story."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Etie] 
So I've got a lot of respect for the way you 
came out the other side."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Yunaka] 
Ah, gee whiz..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Etie] 
See these flowers? They're from my hometown."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Yunaka] 
They're gorgeous."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Etie] 
This one is associated with admiration. 
Sounds perfect for us, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Yunaka] 
Hehe, it does. Yeah!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Etie] 
Why don't we make flower crowns with them 
as a gift for each other?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Etie] 
That's what true friends do where I'm from."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Etie] 
They make flower crowns and pray for long, 
happy lives together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Yunaka] 
Love it! Let's make such big crowns, we get 
mistaken for queens of the world!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Etie] 1

[Etie] 
Sorry about before, Yunaka. I think maybe you 
misunderstood me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Yunaka] 
I misunderstood you, did I?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Etie] 
I mean, you did steal something. That part 
is true."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Etie] 
But what you stole, well..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Yunaka] 
What did I steal?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Etie] 
You captured my interest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Yunaka] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Etie] 
You have my ideal physique. I couldn't look 
away from how perfect you are."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Etie] 
That's why I wanted to do a close inspection."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Yunaka] 
Aw, what a preventable misunderstanding..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Etie] 
You're right. I was rude. I'm really sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Yunaka] 
Setting aside how bonkers this is for a second, 
what makes you think I'm any kind of ideal?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Yunaka] 
Your physique is way more impressive 
than mine."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Etie] 
That's nice of you to say, but between the two 
of us, you might actually be stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Etie] 
Sure, I'm ripped, but that's just because I never 
stop working out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Etie] 
You, on the other hand, have the kind of muscle 
that can only come...naturally."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Etie] 
Your metabolism must have been set like that 
early. Probably when you were little."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Etie] 
You only get that kind of muscle by constantly 
being exposed to extreme circumstances."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Etie] 
I can't prove any of that, of course, but my gut 
says I'm on the right track."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Yunaka] 
Um..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Etie] 
What exactly have you lived through?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Yunaka] 
Geez..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Etie] 
Yeah, that's the kind of rude thing I'm going to 
try not to pull anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Yunaka] 
Oh! Are you...sure?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Etie] 
Of course. Don't worry about it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Etie] 
I admire you, that's all. I wanted you to know it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Etie] 
And if it's OK with you, I'd like to be friends."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Yunaka] 
Y'know, that's actually super sweet. Yeah, why 
not? Let's be chums, chum!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Yunaka] 2 

[Etie] 
Hey, Yunaka. Mind doing me a favor?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Yunaka] 
Whatcha need, pumpkin-seed?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Etie] 
Stay real still. I need to give you a once-over."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Yunaka] 
Wait, uh, what? Why? What are you looking for? 
And what are you gonna do if you find it?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Etie] 
So many questions. Here, this'll only take 
a second."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Yunaka] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Yunaka] 
Hey, I didn't consent to a shakedown. You're 
searching me like you think I stole something."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Etie] 
Good guess. How did you figure it out?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Yunaka] 
Seriously?! That was a joke! I haven't stolen 
anything! Not even one thing!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Etie] 
I happen to know that you did."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Yunaka] 
Yeah?! You think your touchy-feely hands are 
any kind of evidence?! Get outta here!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Etie] 
Calm down. Nobody's in trouble."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Yunaka] 
Oh, nobody's in trouble?! Does that mean I'm 
free to go?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Yunaka] 
Great! Then I'm out!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Yunaka] 

[Etie] 
Hey, wait! Yunaka!"
