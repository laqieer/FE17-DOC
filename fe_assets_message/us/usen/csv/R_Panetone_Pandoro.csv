[Panette] 
Hey, brother. You praying?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Yes. I'm glad to see you showing your face here."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Panette] 
I've got so many bad memories of this place 
that I really didn't want to."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Panette] 
But this isn't our parents' church anymore. 
It's yours."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Panette] 
So I figured it might be all right to stop by─ 
just for a few minutes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Pandreo] 
Well, it's great to have you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Panette] 
Yeah. So, um... Guess I'll pray real quick."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Panette] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Panette] 
I prayed for peace."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Panette] 
And while I was at it...I prayed that our parents 
are OK. Wherever they are."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Pandreo] 
Good for you, Panette."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Panette] 
What do you think they're doing right now?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Pandreo] 
No idea. To be honest, I have a feeling 
they're dead."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Pandreo] 
But who knows? Maybe we'll find them 
someday, just like you and I found each other."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Panette] 
Now that we're adults and we have a little 
distance from...everything that happened..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Panette] 
I'd like to think we could sit them down and 
have an honest-to-goodness conversation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Pandreo] 
That would be nice."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Pandreo] 
I think they'd be proud of us. Of you, especially."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Panette] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Pandreo] 
Panette, listen. I need you to survive this war."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Pandreo] 
I... I can't bear to lose any more of my family."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Panette] 
Duh. I'm not gonna go dying on you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Panette] 
In fact, I'll do you one better. I'll save your 
priestly hide too."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Pandreo] 
Haha, glad to hear it. With the fearsome Panette 
protecting me, I know I'll be all right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Panette] 
You know it! You and me, we're gonna survive 
this thing together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Panette] 
How come you've never told me off for running 
away from home?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Why would I? I was glad you got out when 
you did."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Panette] 
Huh. I always imagined you'd hold a grudge 
against me for flying the coop."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Nah. I just wasn't brave enough to do likewise. 
Wasn't sure I could make it alone."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Pandreo] 
Meanwhile, look at you. A retainer! You struck 
out on your own and made a life for yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Pandreo] 
I'll bet those parents of ours would be glad to 
see how well you're doing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Panette] 
I doubt it. They probably don't care about me 
one way or another."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Pandreo] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Pandreo] 
Listen. I probably shouldn't tell you this, but I'm 
not one to keep secrets."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Mom and Dad tried to find you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Panette] 
What?! Wolfdung... There's no way."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Pandreo] 
I was surprised too."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Maybe they were just concerned about... 
keeping up appearances. Hard to say."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Pandreo] 
At any rate, that's the truth. I figured you 
should know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Panette] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Panette] 
What am I supposed to do with that?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Panette] 
Hello, Pandreo. Have you a moment to spare?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Of course! I always have time for my sister. 
But first you've gotta tone down the formality."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Panette] 
Ah, all right. You see, there's something I've 
been meaning to ask you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Nope, nope. You're still speaking in that 
highfalutin way."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Panette] 
You don't really expect me to─"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Pandreo] 
Yes, I do. I know you make an effort to sound 
fancy, but come on. It's only me here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Pandreo] 
You can drop the silver-spoon act around your 
own brother."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Panette] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Panette] 
Fine. Why are you working for the church?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Pandreo] 
That's what you wanted to know, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Panette] 
Dad was a drunk. Mom was a corrupt priest 
who couldn't be bothered to look after her kids."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Panette] 
They were lousy parents."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Panette] 
So why would you wanna follow in their 
footsteps─serve their church?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Pandreo] 
I told you what happened after you left, right? 
They disappeared."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Panette] 
Yeah. So?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Pandreo] 
Well, the church's followers needed someone to 
guide them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Pandreo] 
That's why I stepped in."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Panette] 
Hmph. So that's what it was."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Pandreo] 
I know it's been a while, but if you'd like to 
come pray with us, you're always welcome."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Panette] 
No. I think I'll pass."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Panette] 
I'm done with our parents, and I'm done with 
their church."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Panette] 
I'd sooner drop dead than step foot in that 
place again."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#023,"[Pandreo] 
Fair enough."
