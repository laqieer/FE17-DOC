[Goldmary] 
Hello, Framme. Notice anything different 
about me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Goldmary] 
That's right. My place in the world has been 
restored. I'm once again the picture of elegance."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Framme] 
Hey, that's great! I'm glad our efforts paid off."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Framme] 
I mean...you don't seem any different to me. 
But I'm glad you're feeling better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Goldmary] 
You can't tell? I'm tilting my head 10 degrees 
instead of that unseemly 15."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Framme] 
Umm... OK!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Goldmary] 
I really must thank you, Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Goldmary] 
You stood by me even when my head was tilted 
much too far to be taken seriously."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Goldmary] 
You were even there to help me practice 
my expression until I got it exactly right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Goldmary] 
Thanks to you, I understand that one graceless 
moment isn't going to ruin a friendship."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Framme] 
Exactly. Friends aren't superficial with each 
other like that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Goldmary] 
Would you let me give my thanks in the form 
of a delicious home-cooked meal?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Framme] 
Yeah! I'd love that!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Goldmary] 
I will make something with those apples we 
gathered. It will be both tasty and nutritious."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Framme] 
Ooh, I can't wait! This is gonna be amazing!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Goldmary] 
Try to temper your expectations. It will only be 
about as good as the top restaurants."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Framme] 
Only that good, huh? Hehe, you're really 
confident in your cooking."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry in advance if the delights I prepare 
ruin your taste buds to all other cuisine..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Framme] 
Hehehe! I'm glad to see you're fully back to 
your old self, Goldmary."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Framme] 
And I can't wait to try what you cook up!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Aw..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Framme] 
Hey, Goldmary! How'd it turn out with the 
apples we gathered the other day?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Better than I could have possibly imagined, 
unfortunately..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Goldmary] 
They also ruined my life."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Framme] 
Um, what? How?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Goldmary] 
I was so delighted eating the dish I made that 
my face bore a terribly inelegant expression."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Framme] 
Um, I don't get it. Your face looks fine to me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Goldmary] 
It's fine now, but there's nothing I can do about 
those who saw it. They'll remember forever."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Framme] 
I still don't think I see the problem, but OK..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Goldmary] 
How can you not see? Whenever those people 
look at me, they'll see nothing but a silly face."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Framme] 
I really don't think they will, if they even noticed 
the, um, expression to begin with."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Framme] 
You sound like you could use a break though. 
Hey, how about taking a soak in a hot spring?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Framme] 
That'd be nice and relaxing, right? Get you 
feeling back to your elegant self again?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Goldmary] 
No! I can't do that!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Framme] 
What? Why not?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Goldmary] 
What if someone who saw my silly face is 
there? What if they tell everyone?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Goldmary] 
I'd never live it down..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Framme] 
I'm sure that won't happen, Goldmary. Look, 
this isn't the end of the world, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Goldmary] 
If everyone there knew how ridiculous I looked, 
I could never go to the hot springs again."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Goldmary] 
There's no way to know if anyone who saw me 
would be there...until I went there."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Goldmary] 
It's like wanting to go shopping for clothes... 
without having an outfit to wear to the store..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Framme] 
OK, I...don't really get it, but I'm sure it's 
nothing to worry about. Please don't cry."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Goldmary] 
Will you...help me rehearse my demeanor until 
it's graceful and refined again?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Framme] 
Um..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Framme] 
Sure, yeah. Whatever makes you feel better..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Goldmary] 
Thank you, Framme."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Goldmary] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Goldmary] 
Here we are, Framme. This is the perfect spot 
for apple picking."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Framme] 
Oooh, it's pretty!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Framme] 
Kind of a long hike just to get some fruit to cook 
with, don't you think? Phew!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Goldmary] 
The best food requires the best ingredients. 
Gathering them takes effort."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Framme] 
Just getting here was a serious workout. 
Cooking is no joke!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Framme] 
I can't wait to relax in a nice warm bath after 
I get home."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Framme] 
Uh, Goldmary? What are you doing?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Goldmary] 
What's the matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Framme] 
Why are you taking your clothes off?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Framme] 
Put them back on this instant!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Goldmary] 
There's a lovely spring right here. I thought 
I would take a quick dip."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Framme] 
A little warning would've been nice!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Goldmary] 
Warning? For what? I was only going to 
rinse off."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Goldmary] 
You said yourself you were looking forward 
to a bath after that long hike."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Framme] 
Um, sure...but I was planning on doing that 
when I got home."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Framme] 
You're really comfortable enough to just take a 
bath out in the open?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Goldmary] 
Yes, it seems normal to me. But that's probably 
because I grew up in a village with hot springs."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Framme] 
I always thought you seemed pretty shy, but it 
looks like I was totally wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Framme] 
I guess that's what I get for judging by 
appearances, huh..."
