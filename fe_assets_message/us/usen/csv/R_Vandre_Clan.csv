[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Vander] 
And the other day... You should know better 
than to run off when your superior is speaking!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Vander] 
I swear, sometimes..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
Hmph..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Vander] 
Ahh... No, this won't do. This is my fault."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Vander] 
Clanne, you have my apologies."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Clanne] 
Your what?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Vander] 
Allow me to state it plainly. I have the highest 
of hopes for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Vander] 
After all, someday I will confer all of my 
responsibilities upon you and your sister."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Clanne] 
So then... How come you never trust me with 
any of the actual work?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Vander] 
This is the actual work."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Clanne] 
But... But..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Vander] 
I ask you to help me with my steward duties 
precisely because I trust you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Vander] 
Sending letters, taking messages to churches... 
Mundane errands, yes. But critical nonetheless."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Clanne] 
Huh..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Vander] 
It seems I never properly conveyed that to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Clanne] 
I... I'm sorry, Vander. I guess I kinda jumped 
to conclusions."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Vander] 
No, the fault is mine. I failed to take your 
feelings into account."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Vander] 
I am nothing if not grateful for your assistance. 
I hope this will not discourage you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Clanne] 
Not even close. I still wanna be a great steward 
like you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Clanne] 
So don't go too easy on me, all right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Vander] 
Of course. I should say the same. If you have 
any concerns, do not hesitate to let me know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Clanne] 2 
[Clanne] 
I don't get it. I'm always going the extra mile to 
impress Vander."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
Why doesn't he ask me to do any real 
steward work?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Clanne] 
He must not trust me... Doesn't think I can 
handle it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Vander] 
Clanne!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Clanne] 
Y-yes, sir!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Vander] 
I need you to pass along a message to the 
church nearby."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Vander] 
If I have said it once, I have said it a thousand 
times. Respond promptly when spoken to."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Clanne] 
Vander, am I just...your errand boy?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Vander] 
Beg pardon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Clanne] 
How can I become a great steward if you won't 
let me do any actual work?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Vander] 
What? Listen, Clanne, the work of a steward is─"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Clanne] 
""Far beyond your meager abilities!"""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Clanne] 
I get it. I won't amount to anything. Why waste 
your time properly training me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Vander] 
What are you talking about?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Clanne] 
Nothing. I'll do what you say and speak when 
spoken to. Vander's little helper, that's me!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Clanne] 
One message to the church, coming right up."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Vander] 
Wait! Clanne, listen!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Vander] 
Clanne!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Clanne] 2 
[Clanne] 
I picked up the letters like you asked, Vander."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Vander] 
Ah, yes. Set them down over there, will you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Clanne] 
I also brought a letter opener. Thought you 
might need it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Vander] 
Very good. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Vander] 
Clanne, before I forget. Will you deliver 
this package?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Clanne] 
Oh... Yes, sir."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Vander] 
Answering letters... Hmph! A man of my age 
should put his fighting hand to nobler purposes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Vander] 
Is something the matter?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Clanne] 
Wha? Oh, uh, no. Everything's...hunky-dory."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Vander] 
Well then, why are you standing there gawking? 
I told you to deliver that package."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Clanne] 
Y-yes, sir..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Vander] 
On with it, then. A faithful servant of the Divine 
Dragon wastes no time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Clanne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Clanne] 
If you gave me some real steward work to do, 
maybe I'd take it more seriously..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Vander] 
Pardon?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Clanne] 
N-nothing! I'll deliver that package for you 
right away, sir."
