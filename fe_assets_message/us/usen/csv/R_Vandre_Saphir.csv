[Saphir] 
Vander! My knitting project's all done!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Vander] 
Finally finished, have you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
It's just a little drawstring pouch, but...came out 
pretty good, didn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Vander] 
Hmm... Stitches are straight, loops consistent... 
This is well made."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Vander] 
Clearly the result of your hard work and 
determination. Fantastically done."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Saphir] 
I have to say, once I got into a rhythm with it, 
knitting was...really calming. Like meditation."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Saphir] 
I get what you meant now─about how you see 
this like another kind of training."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Saphir] 
I'm grateful to you for teaching me, Vander. 
To show my appreciation...I made you this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Saphir] 
Nothing too fancy. Just a little something extra 
I threw together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Vander] 
Ah, a scarf!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Vander] 
The pouch was excellent on its own, but to 
make this too, and so quickly... I'm impressed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Saphir] 
Brodian knights hate to quit, but we love to 
learn. Gotta put in the work to be the best."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Vander] 
I see. However, you should know that, good as 
you are, you will not surpass my skill easily!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Saphir] 
I've got a long way to go for that, I know."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Vander] 
In all seriousness, perhaps you and I should 
train together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Saphir] 
Train?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Vander] 
I will teach you more about knitting, and you 
will show me some of your combat techniques."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Saphir] 
Now you're speakin' my language!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Saphir] 
Yeah, I'd love that. I'm sure there's a lot we can 
learn from each other!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Vander] 1

[Vander] 
You dropped a stitch, Saphir."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Saphir] 
Ugh... Yeah, of course I did. Stupid tiny loops 
can't sit still for half a second..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Vander] 
Easy, now. Slow down or you will find yourself 
with a tangled mess."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Saphir] 
We're way past that. It looks like an old fishnet 
that washed ashore."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Vander] 
Hmm... Yes, I see. You will need to rip out those 
last few stitches and do them over."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Saphir] 
Really?! You think?! Ugh... I can't do this."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Vander] 
Fear not, this only practice. A clumsy mistake 
is but a learning experience."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Saphir] 
Clumsy! Yeah, because I'm SO... Ugh. I'm sorry, 
Vander. Knitting's not for me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Saphir] 
I appreciate you taking the time, but I'm not cut 
out for this kind of thing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Vander] 
Is that so? I am surprised to see a knight of 
Brodia surrender at the first sign of trouble."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Vander] 
The warriors of Brodia are famed for their 
resolve. Perhaps that reputation is misleading."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Saphir] 
Uh-huh."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Saphir] 
Trying to get a rise out of me? Doesn't suit you. 
Stick to the delicate stuff."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Saphir] 
You're right, though, about Brodian knights. 
We never quit, and I'm not about to start."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Vander] 
Perhaps I have been too hard on you. I will be 
more gentle in my instruction from now on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Saphir] 
No, no. You've done more than enough. 
I'll handle the rest on my own."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Saphir] 
I'm gonna knit so hard it pops your pauldrons. 
You just stand back and wait to be impressed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Vander] 
Very well. I eagerly await your results."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Vander] 2 

[Vander] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Vander] 
Nothing like a bit of knitting to properly relax."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Saphir] 1 

[Saphir] 
Oh, Vander! Didn't expect to see you doing 
some, uh...needlework?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Vander] 
Oh, Saphir."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Vander] 
Not so loud, please. This is a delicate project. 
I am likely to bungle it if you startle me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Saphir] 
Right. Sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Saphir] 
Guess I was just surprised to see you knitting, 
of all things. Hobby of yours?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Vander] 
Yes. And how is it surprising? Do you lack any 
hobbies of your own?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Saphir] 
I'm a simple knight, through and through. 
Combat training is all I need."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Vander] 
Always more to learn there. But this skill can be 
useful on the battlefield as well."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Saphir] 
Yeah? How do you figure?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Vander] 
Knitting demands that you learn movements 
requiring finesse, mastering them by repetition."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Vander] 
Taking shortcuts also leads to sloppy results."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Vander] 
The same could be said of the skills we train 
for combat, wouldn't you say?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Saphir] 
OK, I see what you're getting at, and you might 
have a point there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Vander] 
Are you interested in learning the craft, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Saphir] 
Why not? Sure."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Vander] 
Excellent. I will be happy to teach you what 
I know. I think you will find it most fulfilling."
