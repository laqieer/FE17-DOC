Depending on the wielder, power can be used 
for good or evil with equal ease."
MID_BT1_#002,"[Byleth] StandBy 
[Byleth] 
That's why the heart of the one controlling 
the power is important."
MID_BT1_#003,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] Surprise 

[Alear] 
The heart. That would mean..."
MID_BT1_#004,"[Alear] Strike 

[Alear] 
My heart determines how the power is used... 
All right, Byleth. I'm ready!"
MID_BT2_#001,"[Hortensia] t 
[Hortensia] Sad 
[Hortensia] 
I've gotta say it feels a little weird to fight 
someone who's supposed to be an ally."
MID_BT2_#002,"[Byleth] b 
[Byleth] 
Smile 
[Byleth] 
Just because we're fighting doesn't make us 
enemies. Not this time."
MID_BT2_#003,"[Byleth] 
We're still friends. But for now, prepare 
for battle."
MID_BT2_#004,"[Hortensia] Strike 
[Hortensia] 
OK. I've got no choice but to fight? Let's do it."

[Alear] 
I managed to win...somehow."
MID_ED1_#002,"[Byleth] 
Well done. Your fighting was magnificent. 
The trial is passed."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Alear] 
I learned so much battling you."
MID_ED1_#004,"[Byleth] 
Thank you, but your skills were quite strong 
even before we met."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Alear] 
Still, you've taught me so many things."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
You're an excellent teacher, Byleth."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Byleth] 
That's kind of you to say. Though it helps that 
you have such raw skill already."
MID_ED1_#008,"[Byleth] 
All I need do is listen and give a little nudge 
to those embarking on a path."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Byleth] 
Your success here is the direct result of all the 
choices you've made before today."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Alear] 
I've always understood that one choice leads 
to another, but..."
MID_ED1_#011,"[Alear] 
I'm worried what might happen if I ever make 
the wrong choice..."
MID_ED1_#012,"[Byleth] 
You needn't worry at all. By passing this trial, 
you've shown the truth of who you are."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Byleth] 
And you have your allies to set you right... 
should you ever begin to stray."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Byleth] 
Remember, I will always be by your side 
as well. To the very end."
MID_ED1_#015,"[Alear] 
Thank you. I'll continue on my path, trusting my 
allies to help me along the way."
MID_ED1_#016,"[Byleth] 
You've clearly learned all you need to here. 
Shall we continue on our journey?"
MID_EV1_#001,"[Byleth] b 
[Byleth] Normal 
[Byleth] 
To win the fight, keep your eyes wide. Always 
know where your enemies are."
MID_EV2_#001,"[Alear] t 
[Alear] Surprise 

[Alear] 
What are those things scattered around 
the battlefield?"
MID_EV2_#002,"[Byleth] b 
[Byleth] StandBy 
[Byleth] 
Those are my targets, and I will destroy them... 
Unless you can prevent me from doing so."
MID_EV2_#003,"[Alear]

[Alear] 
I'll guard them well!"

[Alear] 
What is that? In the back there. Is that... 
a throne?"
MID_OP1_#002,"[Byleth] 
This resembles the Holy Tomb. That's a place 
from my world."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Alear] 
What is the Holy Tomb?"
MID_OP1_#004,"[Byleth] 
It's where the goddess Sothis sleeps. For the 
Church of Seiros, this is the holiest place of all."
MID_OP1_#005,"[Byleth] 
To ensure the safety of the tomb, a monastery 
was built atop it."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Alear] 
OK... So, why is it here?"
MID_OP1_#007,"[Byleth] 
Only a very few know the legend of Saint Seiros 
and the Holy Tomb."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Byleth] 
Saint Seiros received power and revelation from 
the goddess and, with it, a sacred duty."
MID_OP1_#009,"[Byleth] 
She was to save the people of Fódlan, and use 
her power wisely in order to lead them."
MID_OP1_#010,"[Byleth] 
Perhaps it's inevitable that we'd be guided here."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Alear] 
Why do you say that?"
MID_OP1_#012,"[Byleth] 
If the bond between us is to further strengthen, 
then you must face a trial here."
MID_OP1_#013,"[Alear] 
I see. And you want me to fight you, Byleth?"
MID_OP1_#014,"[Byleth] 
Show me whether you can wisely use the power 
you've gained on your journey so far."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Alear] 
Understood."
MID_OP1_#016,"[Byleth] 
In your eyes, I see no hesitation. Good. 
Ready yourself!"
MID_OP1_#017,"[Alear] 
I'm ready. And I won't hold anything back!"
