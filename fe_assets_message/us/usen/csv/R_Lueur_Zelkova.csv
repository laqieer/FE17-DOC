[Zelkov] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Today's work is complete. Now I am free to 
*kill time* until sleep arrives."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
Ah, Zelkov! I've been *waiting* for you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Zelkov] 
Divine One?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
I finished my tasks *early* today, so I came 
*here.* I hope you *don't mind!*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Zelkov] 
I don't mind, but...the way you are speaking... 
Do you mean to suggest...a *deeper meaning*?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alear] 
Perhaps I do. Perhaps some of your *influence* 
has rubbed off on me, Zelkov."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Zelkov] 
You should not want to walk the path I walk. 
People will *look* at you strangely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
Let them. I don't *care* what they think."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alear] 
I'm just *amusing myself* and *killing time* by 
*speaking in a profound way.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Oh, no no no! Please, Divine One, do not allow 
yourself to be *influenced* by someone like me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
Why *not*?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Zelkov] 
We lead very different lives, Divine One. 
You have an important *purpose* to fulfill."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Zelkov] 
I am a terrible influence. Please, you must 
follow a path more *fitting* to your station."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alear] 
I don't think I *will.* Not in this room, anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Zelkov] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alear] 
It's true that there are *differences* between 
you and me, *Zelkov.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
But here, in *this* room, what do those 
*differences* *matter*?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alear] 
All we're doing is *killing time.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Zelkov] 
I deeply regret filling your head with *rubbish.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alear] 
Please, don't apologize. *Go on,* tell me more 
about your *collection*."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Zelkov] 
Very well, what should I talk about next? 
Ah, this here is *perfect.*"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Zelkov] 
A list of the most mysterious words to 
*emphasize* to *suggest* a deeper meaning."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alear] 
Ooo! That sounds *interesting!*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Zelkov] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Welcome. This is the *interesting* place that I 
mentioned to you before. My secret sanctum."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
Whoa! I've never seen so many shelves full 
of...stuff!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Zelkov] 
Yes. I *collect* odds and ends for my pursuits 
here in this place."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Zelkov] 
Instructions for a *culinary* technique of my 
own devising. A map for a hike only I know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Zelkov] 
There is a manual of training techniques I wrote, 
next to a rock that I polished to a *sparkle.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Zelkov] 
And here are some balls of *lint* I've gathered 
for reasons even I don't quite understand."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Zelkov] 
That should suffice for a summary. A detailed 
accounting would take *hours.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Zelkov] 
Just know *every* object here has helped me 
kill time. Feel free to handle whatever you like."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alear] 
Thank you! What a treasure trove..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Zelkov] 
Once my work is done each day, I fill my 
evenings with these varied *pursuits.*"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Zelkov] 
As I *enjoy* them, I am always mindful to leave 
something unfinished for the next day."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Zelkov] 
That ensures I always have a project. 
A reason to *continue* living."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Alear] 
Wow... So philosophical..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Zelkov] 
You... You truly think so?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Zelkov] 
Well... Thank you for enduring this frivolity. 
I hope I did not *bore* you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
What a thing to say! I'm not even done 
exploring in here yet!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Zelkov] 
Heh-heh. You honor me. Take as much *time* 
as you like."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Zelkov] 2 

[Alear] 
What's that you're doing, Zelkov?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Zelkov] 
Hello, Divine One. I am melting wax, with 
which I will *produce* candles."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alear] 
Oh, wow! Is candle-making a hobby of yours?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Zelkov] 
You could call it that. I *prefer* to think of it as 
a pursuit through which to kill time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alear] 
Kill time?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Zelkov] 
Some say you kill time until time kills you. 
That is my *philosophy.*"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alear] 
I had no idea you were such a profound 
thinker, Zelkov."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Zelkov] 
Heh. Not at all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Zelkov] 
I may speak in a way that *suggests* a deeper 
meaning, but rarely is that actually the case."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Zelkov] 
It is simply another way of ""killing time."" 
Idle *amusement,* nothing more."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Alear] 
Wow..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Zelkov] 
What is it? Your eyes are possessed of a most 
*curious* twinkle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alear] 
I guess I just find your outlook fascinating. It's a 
whole new perspective to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Alear] 
Somehow it feels like you know a lot of things 
that I don't."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Zelkov] 
Heh. You are *interesting.* Perhaps, next time 
we chat, I will show you an interesting place."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
Now I'm curious."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Zelkov] 
I will keep the nature of it a *surprise* for 
the time being."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Alear] 
All right. I look forward to it!"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Zelkov] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Zelkov] 
I have been *waiting* for you, Divine One. 
Please, take a seat."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Alear] 
What do you have for me today, Zelkov?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Zelkov] 
I thought I might tell you a *story.*"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
About what?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Zelkov] 
How I came to be as I am. Why I require these 
*pursuits* in order to have a reason to live."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Zelkov] 
I am afraid it is a rather *dark* tale. But it is 
the only way for you to understand."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Zelkov] 
When I was young, my family was attacked 
and *murdered* by bandits."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
That's horrible."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Zelkov] 
I swore *revenge.* It was my first pursuit─and it 
led me to take up the life of an assassin."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Zelkov] 
A decade ago, my *efforts* bore their last fruit. 
All my family's killers were vanquished."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Zelkov] 
Once I had achieved my end, I suddenly became 
aware that I had *nothing* left. No purpose."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Zelkov] 
It was King Hyacinth who rescued me, quite by 
chance. I was *selected* to join the royal guard."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Zelkov] 
Then I was *promoted* to retainer, and that 
*purpose* has sustained me in large part since."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Zelkov] 
Thus I *stand* before you today."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Alear] 
I appreciate you telling me this, but I'm still 
not sure I understand why you felt the need."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Zelkov] 
I would like you to join me in my continued 
pursuit of purpose, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Alear] 
You what?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Zelkov] 
Forgive my foolishness. I should have *known* 
you would never want such a thing."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
The complete opposite, as a matter of fact. 
There's nothing I want more."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
I've actually been planning to give this to you 
for a while. Now seems like the right time."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Zelkov] 
The *Pact* Ring..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Alear] 
Whether it's to find a greater purpose or just 
to kill time, I want to be there to support you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Zelkov] 
You are actually *serious,* aren't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
Of course I am. Would I joke about something 
so important?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Zelkov] 
You would not. Therefore I accept, and gladly."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Zelkov] 
In return, , please accept a gift 
from me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
A necklace? It's lovely."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Zelkov] 
Each component was selected to represent a 
facet of my respect and affection for you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Alear] 
This is amazing, Zelkov. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Alear] 
You know, I just noticed..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Zelkov] 
What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033,"[Alear] 
The way you're speaking has changed 
somehow. I can't put my finger on it."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034,"[Zelkov] 
Heh-heh. You're right. I've felt no need to 
sound as if my words have a deeper meaning."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035,"[Zelkov] 
I suppose that's because this conversation is 
already meaningful to me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#036,"[Alear] 
Haha, I'm flattered."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#037,"[Alear] 
Now, if you don't mind, I'd love to hear about 
how you chose the materials for this necklace."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#038,"[Zelkov] 
Of course. I will tell you the whole process, 
from start to finish."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#039,"[Zelkov] 
And I will share how each choice along the way 
was governed by my sentiments."
