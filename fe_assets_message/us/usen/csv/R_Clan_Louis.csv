[Louis] 
This is a dark day indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Clanne] 
Louis? What's wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Louis] 
I am heartbroken to learn that your workout 
sessions with the prince have concluded."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Clanne] 
How did you know about that?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Louis] 
I overheard it all from my position not far away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Clanne] 
You were there?! I didn't notice at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Louis] 
I happened to come across the two of you, so 
I took the liberty of standing guard nearby."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Clanne] 
Oh, that makes sense. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Louis] 
You two have a truly unique rapport."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Louis] 
The juxtaposition of the hearty Firenese prince 
and an attentive lad of Lythos struck me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Louis] 
Your warmth and brotherly goodwill─they set 
my very heart alight!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Louis] 
In all my years of people watching, those 
workouts were in a class of their own."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Clanne] 
Well, if it helps, Prince Alfred is going to give 
workout lessons to someone else now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Louis] 
Is this true?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Clanne] 
It is. And I'm going to look for someone else to 
pass on what I learned from the prince."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Louis] 
Then it isn't over."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Clanne] 
Pardon?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Louis] 
What I thought was a finale was, in truth, 
a prelude. And the cast has doubled in size!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Louis] 
How many more voices will be recruited into 
this muscular chorus? Who can truly say?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Louis] 
And I shall be there for all of it─a connoisseur 
of the human condition. I eagerly await my role."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Clanne] 
Umm... Are you...OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Louis] 
Er, yes! Of course!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Louis] 
I hope you will keep me informed as to when 
your next workout session is scheduled."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Louis] 
I support these endeavors wholeheartedly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Louis] 
I hope I may continue to find a place in them as 
your appreciative audience."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Clanne] 
Thanks for the support, Louis!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Louis] 2 
[Louis] 
Yes...it is plain to me now. At last, I have a 
firmer grasp of the situation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Louis] 
Within Clanne's slight frame, there lies a 
discernible core of strength."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Louis] 
The prince, noticing this, took the Lythian under 
his wing with a private workout. How grand!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Louis] 
There's still a piece of the puzzle that eludes 
me, but I'm one step closer to understanding!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Clanne] 
Uh, Louis? Are you OK? I thought I heard you 
muttering to yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Louis] 
Uh, I'm fine, I'm fine. You heard nothing."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Louis] 
Tell me, how was your workout session with 
the prince?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Clanne] 
It was fun! And with your help, I don't think 
I embarrassed myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Clanne] 
Prince Alfred was even nicer than usual. He was 
very patient and taught me a lot about exercise."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Louis] 
Even nicer than usual?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Louis] 
The prince is always so kindhearted, I struggle 
to imagine that. Might I ask you to elaborate?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Clanne] 
Uh, sure, if you want."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Louis] 
Do you think he was being nicer because he 
considers you a friend, or was there more to it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Clanne] 
Oooh, I see what you mean."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Clanne] 
Yeah, he did have kind of a different energy. 
It felt almost like he wished we were brothers."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Louis] 
Brothers, you say!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Louis] 
A pair of brothers...one from Firene, and the 
other from Lythos. A rare occurrence indeed!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Clanne] 
Are you feeling well? Do you need to sit down?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Louis] 
Merely a minor epiphany. Pay it no mind."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Clanne] 
Oh, right! We had plans to work out again. 
Would you be interested in joining us?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Louis] 
Not at all. You two go ahead. I would never 
dream of interfering in something so sacred."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Louis] 
May the two of you have a productive workout 
as I contemplate the vision you've shown me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Louis] 2 
[Clanne] 
And how fare you today...Prince Alfred? 
Thank you...ever so much...for inviting me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Mmm. No, that's too stiff. I should try to 
sound warmer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Louis] 
Is something amiss, Clanne?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Clanne] 
Bwah! Where did you come from?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Louis] 
My apologies. I thought I heard someone 
mention my prince's name."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Clanne] 
You heard right. Prince Alfred invited me to 
work out with him today."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Clanne] 
But I've never spent time alone with him before, 
so I'm nervous about saying the wrong thing."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Louis] 
A private exercise session for the two of you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Clanne] 
That's right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Louis] 
Hm. Not a solo or a group session. What could 
this signify?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Clanne] 
I don't think it signifies anything."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Louis] 
Ah, but pay me no mind. So, then, you are 
practicing your greetings to the prince?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Clanne] 
Yes! I don't want to embarrass myself by being 
accidentally rude."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Clanne] 
Maybe you could be my sounding board, Louis?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Clanne] 
I'll talk to you like you're Prince Alfred, and if 
anything seems off, you can correct it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Louis] 
A capital idea. When it comes to manners, you 
have turned to the right man!"
