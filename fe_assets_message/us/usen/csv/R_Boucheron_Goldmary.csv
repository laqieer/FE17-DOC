[Goldmary] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Is that you, Goldmary? Why are you sitting here 
in the dark?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Oh, hello, Boucheron..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Goldmary] 
I've made meals for just about everyone now, 
and I've barely gotten any praise at all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Goldmary] 
They all said I was asking for too much. So now 
I feel like giving up..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Boucheron] 
Poor you. Those guys have a lot to learn."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Goldmary] 
You think so?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Boucheron] 
They don't understand how demanding you are. 
You're practically a world champion at it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Boucheron] 
Me, though, I'm used to it by now. I even think 
it's kind of cute."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Goldmary] 
Boucheron... I'm so glad."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Boucheron] 
Being demanding is just your way of being 
charming."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Boucheron] 
And so long as I think so, who cares what 
anyone else thinks?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Goldmary] 
Oh, thank you. I feel so much better."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Goldmary] 
And now that my smile is worth a million gold 
again, I'll have to pay you back in cooking."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Boucheron] 
Cooking?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Goldmary] 
That's right. I'm going to make you a regular 
lunch from now on."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Boucheron] 
You mean right now?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Goldmary] 
Don't worry. I won't make you shower me 
endlessly with praise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Goldmary] 
You've already given me enough of that to last 
a lifetime."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Goldmary] 
So from now on, all you need to do is relax 
and enjoy what I make for you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Boucheron] 
I wouldn't mind handing out more compliments 
if it means making you happy."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Goldmary] 
Really? You mean it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Boucheron] 
What's wrong?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Goldmary] 
I hope you don't mind a little extra salt. You're 
just so kind...I couldn't hold back my tears."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Boucheron] 
Tears? Oh no..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Boucheron] 
Just hearing the word makes me want to cry!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Goldmary] 
Ah... You're such a sensitive person..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Goldmary] 
I admire that about you, Boucheron... 
It's very charming."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Goldmary] 
I'll get to the cooking. I can't wait to hear 
everything you have to say about it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Boucheron] 
Haha, you cook up more food, I'll cook up more 
praise, and we'll both come out ahead."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Thank you for all your kind praise about the 
lunch I made for you last time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Well, you practically held me at swordpoint."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Your compliments made me so happy that 
I decided to prepare another meal for you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Boucheron] 
Thanks, but I brought my own sandwich today."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Goldmary] 
You won't be satisfied with that once you see 
what I have here."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Boucheron] 
Whoa!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Goldmary] 
Fluffy scrambled eggs, seared scallops wrapped 
in bacon... And more fresh fruit, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if my peerless skill elevates this simple 
dish to unbearable heights of divinity."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Boucheron] 
It's tempting, don't get me wrong. But I'll stick 
with my sandwich all the same."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Goldmary] 
Are you really going to cast aside this golden 
perfection and content yourself with trash?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Goldmary] 
If that's really what you want, I guess I'll have 
to throw this away."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Boucheron] 
Hey now, don't let it go to waste! I'll eat it, 
I'll eat it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Boucheron] 
It's divine! The moment it hits my tongue, every 
inch of me shudders with joy!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Goldmary] 
Not a bad opening remark... But you must have 
more to say than that."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Boucheron] 
Are you kidding me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Goldmary] 
You did well last time, but I hope you won't get 
complacent. Strive to outdo yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Boucheron] 
What I said just now wasn't enough?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Goldmary] 
You made one general comment. What about 
each individual component? Don't be neglectful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Goldmary] 
You could also stand to give an opinion or two 
about my aesthetic choices."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Goldmary] 
I know it's overwhelming, but if you can't do it, 
I'll have to stop you from eating any more."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Boucheron] 
Ooh, what a pain. I knew this would happen, 
but somehow I fell for it anyway..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Goldmary] 
Has this meal made you so tongue-tied that you 
can't give me even one little compliment?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Goldmary] 
If it's hurt you that badly, I should knock it 
out of you before it does any more damage..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Boucheron] 
Uh, no need for that! I'll compliment you all 
you want. Just keep your hands to yourself..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Goldmary] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Hello, Boucheron. I hope you don't mind that 
I made lunch for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Oh, really? Just for me, huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Just for you. The main course is chicken 
on skewers with roasted vegetables."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Goldmary] 
The sides include a small omelet, some lightly 
toasted bread, and fresh fruit for a treat."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Boucheron] 
This is incredible. Not only does it smell great, 
the presentation is practically professional."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry if it looks too perfect. Disturbing it 
must feel like upsetting the world's balance."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Goldmary] 
But I hope you can find the courage. I made it 
especially for you, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Boucheron] 
Don't worry, I'm about to dig in right now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Boucheron] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Boucheron] 
It tastes as good as it smells! This might be one 
of the most delicious meals I've ever had."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, but...is that really all you have to say?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Boucheron] 
Come again?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Goldmary] 
It seems like I deserve a bit more praise than 
that. And could you speak up, please?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Boucheron] 
You want more compliments? What else is 
there to say?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Goldmary] 
What else is there to say?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Goldmary] 
I'm sorry, but I don't know how to answer 
such a dim-witted question."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Boucheron] 
This got spicy all of sudden."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Goldmary] 
There are infinite ways to compliment 
perfection. You barely gave me one."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Goldmary] 
Surely you can think of at least a few more?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Boucheron] 
You know, Goldmary, I'm starting to get the 
idea that you're a little bit demanding."
