[Hortensia] 
Hey, Ivy?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Ivy] 
Yes?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Do you think...I could be like my mother 
someday?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
I mean, obviously I've got her looks already. 
But I'm not sure I have her other qualities."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Ivy] 
You know, Hortensia..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Ivy] 
I think you do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Ivy] 
You lost her when you were seven, correct?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Hortensia] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Ivy] 
But you kept living in the castle, even without 
the benefit of her protection."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Ivy] 
You know what a viper's den of intrigue that 
place is. No ordinary child could survive it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Ivy] 
But your charisma made that possible."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Hortensia] 
What are you getting at?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Ivy] 
Your wit and charm won you allies in the court 
and a safe place in the castle. Sound familiar?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Ivy] 
You thrived in the academy as well─you even 
skipped enough grades to catch up to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Ivy] 
All that was done by virtue of your own merit."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Ivy] 
Do you see it yet?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Ivy] 
You said you hoped you could become like 
your mother someday."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Ivy] 
But you already are. Your light shines on 
everyone you touch, just as hers did."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Hortensia] 
I...I can't believe that's how you see me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Hortensia] 
Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Ivy] 
I should be thanking you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Ivy] 
Your example has given me courage more times 
than I can count."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Ivy] 
Thank you for shining your light on 
me, Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Hortensia] 
Aww..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Hortensia] 
I'm gonna do all I can to live up to the image 
you have of me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Hortensia] 
It was so hard not to just despair and give up 
when we were separated."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Hortensia] 
Father was gone. You were gone... I had no one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Ivy] 
I'm truly sorry, Hortensia. From now on, we'll 
be together."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Hortensia] 
That better be a promise...because you're not 
getting rid of me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#031,"[Ivy] 
Absolutely. We will never be separated again. 
I promise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#032,"[Ivy] 
I am blessed to have family like you, Hortensia. 
I will never willingly let that go."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#033,"[Hortensia] 
Good. Me neither."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 
[Hortensia] 
Ivy... Do you remember much about my mother?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Ivy] 
Of course. She was quite memorable."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Maybe you could tell me a little about her..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Hortensia] 
What do you remember most?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Ivy] 
My clearest memory is her smile."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Ivy] 
My mother hated all of Father's...other women. 
Your mother especially."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Ivy] 
So she was badly mistreated by my mother 
and by all who sought her favor."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Ivy] 
Yet even through all of that, she never seemed 
to stop smiling."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Hortensia] 
Yeah..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Ivy] 
By her charm and wits, she eventually won even 
my mother over."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Ivy] 
She turned her biggest enemy into a friend 
through sheer determination."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Ivy] 
It left a powerful impression on me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Ivy] 
It made me realize how strong a parent can be 
for a child."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Hortensia] 
How strong?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Ivy] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Ivy] 
It seems to me your mother fought those battles 
to carve out a niche for you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Hortensia] 
For me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Ivy] 
Yes. She was the sort of person who shone 
a light on everyone who knew her."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Ivy] 
And you were the reason she shined so bright."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Hortensia] 
This was something I needed to hear."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Hortensia] 
Thank you, Ivy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 

[Ivy] 
Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Hortensia] 
Something on your mind, Ivy? Or are you 
just here to admire my pretty face?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Ivy] 
Hmm. I'm just happy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Ivy] 
We've been through so much, but we're finally 
together again."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Ivy] 
You're my only family now. I want you to know 
that you are important to me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Guess it's a relief to hear a half-sister counts 
as family."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Ivy] 
That has never mattered to me. I have always 
thought of you as my sister."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
And you are all the family I need."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Yeah, well... No need to make it awkward."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Hortensia] 
But I feel the same way, so... Thanks."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Ivy] 
Hmm. You have your mother's smile."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Ivy] 
In fact, you seem to resemble her more and 
more each day."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Hortensia] 
You think so?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Hortensia] 
I'm flattered... I'm really glad."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Hortensia] 
It's only thanks to her I get to call you my sister 
in the first place."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Hortensia] 
Ah, I don't mean to dig all that up. I'm not 
holding a grudge or anything."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Ivy] 
I know..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Ivy] 
Even so, it is because of my mother that you─"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Hortensia] 
Oh, y'know what? I just remembered something 
I gotta do...somewhere. Sorry, Ivy! Talk later!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Hortensia] 

[Ivy] 
I'm sorry, Hortensia..."
