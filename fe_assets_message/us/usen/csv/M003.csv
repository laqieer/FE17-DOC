Whoever it is you are, the rest of your forces

MID_ED2_#003,"So surrender now. If you refuse, I will stop you."

Hm."
MID_ED2_#005,"[Alear] 
Ah! But how?!"
MID_ED2_#006,"[Veyle] 
Do I detect a hint of fear? Of course I do."

MID_ED3_#005,"[Framme] 3 
[Framme] 
Here, Queen Lumera! I'll fix you up!"
MID_ED3_#006,
MID_ED3_#007,Huh?!
MID_ED3_#008,"[Alear] 
What's the matter?"
MID_ED3_#009,"[Framme] 
My staff isn't helping her. She's hurt really bad, and..."
MID_ED3_#010,"It's her Divine Dragon powers─they're almost 
totally wiped out!"
MID_ED3_#011,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_ED3_#012,"[Framme] 
A Divine Dragon losing their power... It's the same 
as losing years of their life."
MID_ED3_#013,"The thing is, there's no reason Queen Lumera should 
be drained like this. It doesn't make any sense!"
MID_ED3_#014,"[Framme] 

[Lumera] 
It's simple, my young one... I gave my power 
unto you."
MID_ED3_#015,"[Alear] 
But why?"
MID_ED3_#016,"[Lumera] 
All the years you were sleeping...healing...I was 
transferring my Divine Dragon powers to you."
MID_ED3_#017,"I hoped it would be enough to bring you back to me someday. 
But now, it would seem that I am completely spent."
MID_ED3_#018,"[Alear] 
Oh no, this is my fault! I did this!"
MID_ED3_#019,"[Lumera] 
No, my dear... You have to push those thoughts away."
MID_ED3_#020,"There is nothing a mother wouldn't do...to see 
life return again...to her beloved child."
MID_ED3_#021,"[Alear] 
But I..."
MID_ED3_#022,[Lumera]
MID_ED3_#023,"This ring... It belongs to you now. The Ring of 
the Holy Knight."
MID_ED3_#024,"I had...so hoped to give you the ring I made, 
as well...but that's not possible now..."
MID_ED3_#028,"Listen to me, child... Those who invaded here... 
I sensed the power of the Fell Dragon within them."
MID_ED3_#029,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_ED3_#030,"[Lumera] 
You must not allow them to capture any more of the rings."
MID_ED3_#031,Please...I beg of you... Gather together all 12 rings.
MID_ED3_#032,"And...when your scattered memories return to you, you must 
fight on with the utmost divinity. I believe in you, my child!"
MID_ED3_#033,"[Alear] 
I understand. I'll collect the rings. I swear to you!"
MID_ED3_#034,"And I'll fight. I'll do whatever you want. 
But please...don't leave me..."
MID_ED3_#035,Mother!
MID_ED3_#036,"[Lumera] 
Ah... Ah, young one...how I've longed to hear 
you call me that..."
MID_ED3_#037,"All those years...I held out hope. My heart 
is fuller than you could ever know."
MID_ED3_#038,"[Alear] 
It can't end like this. You were going to give me that 
ring once my memories came back... You promised!"
MID_ED3_#039,"And there...there are so many things you haven't 
told me yet! You said that we would talk!"
MID_ED3_#040,"[Lumera] 
I did... There's still so much I wanted to say to you..."
MID_ED3_#041,"Being your mother─becoming your mother─ 
has brought so much happiness into my life."
MID_ED3_#042,"[Alear] 
I know...and I'm happy to be your child, in this moment─ 
here and now─and a thousand years ago. I am."
MID_ED3_#043,"Don't go... Stay with me until I remember again! 
Please, Mother─I need more time!"
MID_ED3_#044,"[Lumera] 
Haha... Oh, my sweet one."
MID_ED3_#045,"Now. Let's make a promise... Mother and child. 
We'll make it a pinky promise. I swear to you..."
MID_ED3_#045_2,I'll be with you always and forever.
MID_ED3_#046,"And the ring, remember... Once you've rested... 
we will talk..."

Nor I. And to leave a child behind. I did that 
in death... A bitter memory."
MID_ED4_#009,"I vow to protect your offspring in your 
absence, Lumera."

If we could grant our power now..."

This is awful. Sorry I couldn't have 
done...something."
MID_ED4_#014,"[Vander] 3 

[Vander] 
No, Prince Alfred. Without you, our losses may 
have been even greater."
MID_ED4_#015,"Though I must ask, why did you come? 
Was there something you needed?"
MID_ED4_#016,"[Vander] 
[Alfred] 
Our kingdom is in danger. My mother sent me 
to ask Queen Lumera for help."
MID_ED4_#017,"All over Firene, our people are being attacked 
by these...these...creatures."
MID_ED4_#018,"[Alear] 
Creatures? What kind of creatures?"
MID_ED4_#019,"[Alfred] 
These things are like people, but...cracked, 
almost crumbling."
MID_ED4_#020,"[Alear] 
The Corrupted."
MID_ED4_#021,"[Alfred] 
Oh, so that's what you call them."
MID_ED4_#022,"[Alear] 
Yes. Corpses brought back to life."
MID_ED4_#023,"[Alfred] 
No wonder they wouldn't listen to us. They just 
keep attacking everything."
MID_ED4_#024,"We sent our knights out to hold them off, but 
it's a losing battle."
MID_ED4_#025,My kingdom is being destroyed.
MID_ED4_#026,Divine One...will you help us?
MID_ED4_#027,"Please, come with me to Firene."
MID_ED4_#028,"[Alear] 
Me? What can I do? It was my mother's help 
you wanted, not mine."
MID_ED4_#029,"[Alfred] 
Queen Lumera is gone. You're the last 
Divine Dragon."
MID_ED4_#030,"We need the power of the rings to save Firene. 
And only you can do that."
MID_ED4_#031,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_ED4_#032,"[Alfred] 
Sorry. I don't mean to press the topic."
MID_ED4_#033,I'll return to Firene. We'll...do what we can.
MID_ED4_#034,"[Alear] 
I'm coming with you."
MID_ED4_#035,"[Alfred] 
You will?!"
MID_ED4_#036,"[Alear] 
I don't want more families to be torn apart─ 
more people to suffer."
MID_ED4_#037,"Even if I'm scared, I have to push through 
my fear."
MID_ED4_#038,"Now that my mother is gone, it's my duty to 
step into the role of Divine Dragon."
MID_ED4_#039,"And if each kingdom is protecting rings, I take it 
Firene has one, correct?"
MID_ED4_#040,"[Alfred] 
That's right."
MID_ED4_#041,"[Alear] 
Then I need to go there anyway to honor my 
mother's request."
MID_ED4_#042,"She asked me to gather all of the rings and 
bring peace back to Elyos."
MID_ED4_#043,"As the Divine Dragon, I officially accept the 
kingdom of Firene's request for aid."
MID_ED4_#044,"[Alfred] 
That's great to hear! Thank you, Divine One."
MID_ED4_#045,"[Alear] 
Happy to help, Prince Alfred."
MID_ED4_#046,"[Alfred] 
Just ""Alfred"" is fine. I've been visiting you at the 
Somniel since I was a boy."
MID_ED4_#047,"I think of you as...an old friend. A very, very 
old friend."
MID_ED4_#048,"[Alear] 
I appreciate that. Actually, I can't remember 
anything from before I fell asleep."
MID_ED4_#049,"[Alfred] 
Nothing?"
MID_ED4_#050,"[Alear] 
This world is new to me. I appreciate having 
friends who can teach me about it."
MID_ED4_#051,"[Alfred] 
I'll do my best."
MID_ED4_#052,"Can't say I'll know much compared to Queen 
Lumera, but I'll try."
MID_ED4_#053,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Alfred."
MID_ED5_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Vander] 
We ought to establish a base of operations 
before we begin our journey."
MID_ED5_#002,The Somniel would be uniquely useful.
MID_ED5_#003,"[Alear] 
A little out of the way, isn't it?"
MID_ED5_#004,"I can't imagine how we'd get everyone there 
and back."
MID_ED5_#005,"[Vander] 
As a Divine Dragon, you can travel there no 
matter where you are in the world."
MID_ED5_#006,"[Alear] 
I can?"
MID_ED5_#007,"[Vander] 
Indeed. Furthermore, one can only enter the 
Somniel with a Divine Dragon's power."
MID_ED5_#008,"Without Queen Lumera's blessing, even we 
stewards couldn't have set foot there."
MID_ED5_#009,That is what makes it a safe haven.
MID_ED5_#010,"[Alear] 
Well then, yes. Let's use it as our base."
MID_ED5_#011,"But before we depart, can you give me 
a moment?"
MID_ED5_#012,"[Vander] 
[Vander] Normal 
Hm?"
MID_ED5_#013,"[Alear] 
We'll be gone a while, so...I'd like to say 
goodbye to my mother."
MID_ED5_#014,"[Vander] 
Of course. Take as much time as you need."
MID_ED5_#015,"[Vander] 

[Alear] 
..."
MID_ED5_#016,Thank you for watching over me all this time.
MID_ED5_#017,"This journey will be a long one, but don't worry. 
Vander and the others will be right beside me."
MID_ED5_#018,"I will fulfill my duty as the Divine Dragon. I will 
find all of the rings, just as you asked."
MID_ED5_#019,"And then I'll return to you, Mother. I promise."
MID_ED6_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
Here we are, safely returned to the Somniel."
MID_ED6_#002,I didn't realize how...spacious this place was.
MID_ED6_#003,"[Vander] 
It is rather quiet, I know. But it will liven up 
as we gain allies."
MID_ED6_#004,"We may need someone to supply us with 
equipment as well. Something to consider."
MID_ED6_#005,"[Alear] 
Right."
MID_ED6_#006,"[Vander] 
Oh, by the way, Divine One. Might this 
be yours?"
MID_ED6_#007,"[Alear] 
Hm? A piece of jewelry... I don't recognize it. 
The crystal looks unusual."
MID_ED6_#008,Where did you get this?
MID_ED6_#009,"[Vander] 
On the ground in the Ring Vault, after the siege."
MID_ED6_#010,"I thought it might be yours, but apparently 
I was mistaken."
MID_ED6_#011,"No one has come forward, so it must have 
belonged to an enemy soldier. I'll dispose of it."
MID_ED6_#012,"[Alear] 
Wait."
MID_ED6_#013,"It's familiar somehow, even though I've never 
seen it."
MID_ED6_#014,"[Vander] 
Then please, do take it. Perhaps it will help 
jog your memory."
MID_ED6_#015,"[Alear] 
Thank you, Vander."

for Firene."
