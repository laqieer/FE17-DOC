What do you mean?"
MID_ED1_#010,"[Zephia] 
Well, it used to be in the mountains."
MID_ED1_#011,"Gradlon rose so mightily. But those mountains 
crumbled. That spot is now under a lake."
MID_ED1_#012,"Reaching the shard would be difficult, and 
then destroying it? Surely impossible."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Alear] 
It's at the bottom of a lake?!"
MID_ED1_#014,"[Veyle] 
I did sense that one of them was weaker and 
farther away than the others."
MID_ED1_#015,But I never imagined this...
MID_ED1_#016,"[Alear] 
What do we do now?"
MID_ED1_#017,"[Zephia] 
Simple. You raise the mountains. Or drain 
the lake."
MID_ED1_#018,"Please, take this, an enchanted crystal that 
will bring that location...in reach."
MID_ED1_#019,"[Veyle] 
How did you get this?"
MID_ED1_#020,"[Zephia] 
I am a Mage Dragon. My kind are capable of 
making magical objects..."
MID_ED1_#021,"Small charms and such, you understand. But 
magic of this magnitude...that drains our years."
MID_ED1_#022,"To craft an object that would alter the very 
terrain around you...I've paid a steep price."
MID_ED1_#023,"[Veyle] 
Zephia, you don't mean..."
MID_ED1_#024,"[Zephia] 
Yes, it's making this crystal that has led to my 
end. The magic, in exchange for my life."
MID_ED1_#025,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_ED1_#026,"[Zephia] 
You two were quite fortunate, you know."
MID_ED1_#027,"Of all the Mage Dragons that ever were, only 
I am powerful enough to create this."
MID_ED1_#028,"I learned at the youngest age that I had vast 
powers that were...difficult to control."
MID_ED1_#029,"I would control them, in time, but not before 
my mother, father, and many others, died."
MID_ED1_#030,"Oh, memories... Back to the here and now... 
My very powerful gift."
MID_ED1_#031,"[Veyle] 
Why are you helping us now?"
MID_ED1_#032,"[Zephia] 
Hah...I'm not sure of that myself."
MID_ED1_#033,"Perhaps here at the close, I'm feeling that it's 
just the right thing to do."
MID_ED1_#034,"The crystal's enchantment will last for only a 
few hours. So, hurry along. The shard awaits."
MID_ED1_#035,"Do be careful, Lady Veyle. I'll pray for your 
good fortune in the battles ahead."
MID_ED1_#036,"[Veyle] 
You─ You could have done this at any time! 
Any time at all!"
MID_ED1_#037,"But now you're dying! We could have made 
things right!"
MID_ED1_#038,"If only you'd told us any of this before we 
fought, maybe we could have forgiven..."
MID_ED1_#039,"[Zephia] 
Why now, indeed? Because it is the end."
MID_ED1_#040,"[Veyle] 
Huh?"
MID_ED1_#041,"[Zephia] 
I can be kind, just this once, because it's too 
late for me to make things right."
MID_ED1_#042,"Had I done any of this earlier, would you have 
really forgiven me? We, allies? Heh, nonsense."
MID_ED1_#043,"I had no intention of dying today, but then all 
this happened. So, I made you a crystal."
MID_ED1_#044,"I doubt any of you could swim to that shard. 
It's a long, long way down."
MID_ED1_#045,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_ED1_#046,"Zephia, I... I don't understand you."
MID_ED1_#047,"[Zephia] 
Some advice, dear. Leave those you cannot 
understand behind─forget them entirely."
MID_ED1_#048,"It's just unsettling to let someone like that 
linger in your thoughts as you grow older."
MID_ED1_#049,"[Veyle] 
Once we defeat Papa, and peace arrives..."
MID_ED1_#050,"I won't forget you, Zephia. No matter how many 
hundreds or thousands of years may pass."
MID_ED1_#051,"[Zephia] 
Oh, child... No more of that, please. Hurry 
off to that shard."
MID_ED1_#052,"Unless you prefer to stay and watch me die. 
Would that make you feel safer?"
MID_ED1_#053,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_ED1_#054,"[Alear] 
Let's go, Veyle."
MID_ED1_#055,"[Zephia] 
Yes, go. We can at least end things with 
a clean slate."
MID_ED1_#056,"Goodbye, Lady Veyle. And to you, our new 
Emblem, ."
MID_ED1_#057,"[Alear] 
Goodbye."
MID_ED1_#058,"[Veyle] 
Goodbye, Zephia."
MID_ED1_#059,...

Hell of a time to switch sides."
MID_ED2_#002,"[Zephia] 
My word. I thought they had killed you."
MID_ED2_#003,"[Griss] 
What, you think I'm gonna kick off in the middle of this once-in-a- 
lifetime pain? This is the good stuff. I gotta savor every last drop."
MID_ED2_#004,"Woulda been real ticked off if they'd put me out 
of my misery, not gonna lie..."
MID_ED2_#005,"[Zephia] 
That's really the reason you were playing dead? 
Even at the end...you're an odd man."
MID_ED2_#006,"[Griss] 
How come...you told 'em about the shard?"
MID_ED2_#007,"[Zephia] 
Like I said. I'm just trying to wipe the slate clean."
MID_ED2_#008,"[Griss] 
Cut that out. I wanna know the truth, OK?"
MID_ED2_#009,"[Zephia] 
To get back at Lord Sombron, I guess. Why should 
I die in the dust, while he..."
MID_ED2_#010,"While he gets everything he wanted, just like that. 
Does that seem fair?"
MID_ED2_#011,"Now that they know about the shard, they're sure to break it... 
and he'll know I've met my end─that he's lost me forever."
MID_ED2_#012,"[Griss] 
You gotta really love somebody...if you wanna hurt 
'em that badly."
MID_ED2_#013,"[Zephia] 
I wasn't in love with Lord Sombron. I just wanted 
him to give me a child of my own."
MID_ED2_#014,"That was the dream I clung to through all of the long 
years. A family. The love of a daughter or a son..."
MID_ED2_#015,"When I called the Hounds my family, I meant 
every word of it."
MID_ED2_#015_2,"What we had was something very rare, indeed."
MID_ED2_#016,"You, me, Marni, Mauvier. Working together to 
protect Lord Sombron and Lady Veyle."
MID_ED2_#017,"[Griss] 
But it's too late for all that now..."
MID_ED2_#018,"If you were gonna turn on Sombron, why'd ya wait? 
If you'd done it sooner, maybe we'd still be together."
MID_ED2_#019,"And maybe I wouldn't find myself bleeding out 
at the moment."
MID_ED2_#020,"[Zephia] 
I have to wonder if you'd have been happier on 
the other side."
MID_ED2_#021,"[Griss] 
You really think I would just abandon you? 
Not a chance in hell."
MID_ED2_#022,"[Zephia] 
Huh?"
MID_ED2_#023,"[Griss] 
The Four Hounds, a family..."
MID_ED2_#023_2,"[Griss] 
I always did like the sound of that."
MID_ED2_#024,"I can't even remember what my parents' faces looked 
like. You're the closest thing I had to a mother."
MID_ED2_#025,"Ever since the first day you met me, poor little Twisted 
Disciple that I was...hoping that my suffering would 
be good enough in the eyes of Lord Sombron."
MID_ED2_#026,"You were like a mom to me. And a big sister. Honestly, 
even a god. The most important person in the world to me."
MID_ED2_#027,"[Zephia] 
Griss...I don't like this joke."
MID_ED2_#028,"[Griss] 
It's no joke. I'd follow you anywhere...dummy."
MID_ED2_#029,"[Zephia] 
You're right. How could I have been so blind?"
MID_ED2_#029_2,"[Zephia] 
The one thing I always wanted...staring me in the 
face all the while."
MID_ED2_#030,If only I had realized...
MID_ED2_#030_2,But no. It's too late to think of that.
MID_ED2_#031,I hope you forgive me. We are...a family.
MID_ED2_#032,"I thank you, Griss."
MID_ED2_#033,...
MID_ED2_#034,"[Zephia] 
[Griss] 
Zephia?"
MID_ED2_#035,You drifted off already?
MID_ED2_#035_2,Guess I will...too.

step out of the way."

her goodbye."
MID_OP2_#024,"[Zephia] 
I took Marni into my family. I looked after her. 
What did I get in return? Betrayal."
MID_OP2_#025,"[Veyle] 
How can you call the Four Hounds family? 
Treating them so...viciously."

must punish them─or worse, as needed."

That's all that's important to me."
