[Pandreo] 
Your Highness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Pandreo..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alcryst] 
AWOOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Pandreo] 
Haha! AROOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Alcryst] 
That party was amazing! I had such a fun time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alcryst] 
I shouted until I was out of breath. I let my body 
dance and sway all on its own..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alcryst] 
And I had so, so much fun!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alcryst] 
This is what it's like to party... It feels as if I've 
crossed over into a new world!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Pandreo] 
Aw, yeah! Welcome to the wild world of parties!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alcryst] 
Thank you for guiding me, Pandreo."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Alcryst] 
I came very close to fleeing again. I started to 
dance, and I felt so self-conscious..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alcryst] 
But then I saw you, limbs flailing, torso twisting, 
dancing without a shred of shame..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alcryst] 
I suddenly felt this wave of relief. I cast aside 
my own hesitation and just...danced."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Thanks to your erratic and incomprehensible 
dance moves, I was finally able to enjoy myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Pandreo] 
You know, it's funny."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Pandreo] 
My friends like to make fun of the way I dance. 
They call it the Dance of Darkness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Pandreo] 
But today, it was the Dance of Light─ 
illuminating your soul like a big, bright torch."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Yes! That's exactly how it felt, Pandreo!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alcryst] 
Parties are so wonderful. I know we just left 
one, but can we go to another soon?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Pandreo] 
We'll go to as many as you like, bud! There's 
always another bash on the horizon."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Alcryst] 
Pandreo, I... I..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Pandreo] 
Just let it out, Your Highness."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alcryst] 
AWOOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Pandreo] 
AROOOOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
I have ringing ears...and wobbly knees...and so, 
so many regrets..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Why? Why did I give this a second shot? 
I already knew I didn't belong there..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Pandreo] 2 

[Pandreo] 
AR-AR-AROOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alcryst] 
Oh. Pandreo..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Pandreo] 
Prince Alcryst! You had fun this time, right? 
I saw you mixing it up on the dance floor!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Alcryst] 
I did join in and try to dance, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Alcryst] 
Well, I can only assume that I'm incapable of 
enjoying any party."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Pandreo] 
What makes you say that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Alcryst] 
I had no idea what I was doing back there."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Everyone around me was whirling and gyrating 
so effortlessly. I only know formal dances!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Alcryst] 
And the howling! I do not understand why 
everyone keeps howling! My skull is rattling..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Ah. Now I see the problem."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Listen, Your Highness. There's something 
I forgot to tell you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Pandreo] 
At a party, you don't need to worry about 
whats, whys, and hows. It's not that deep."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Really? Are you sure?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Yep! There's no correct way to dance. And as 
for the howls... They don't mean anything!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alcryst] 
So all of the cheering and dancing is...chaotic 
on purpose? People are just making it up?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Pandreo] 
Exactly. It's about getting lost in the motion 
and having fun. Other than that, anything goes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alcryst] 
I was trying so hard to understand the structure 
of the party─the behaviors and movements..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Alcryst] 
I was in my own head, not on the dance floor. 
I wasn't embracing the spontaneity."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Pandreo] 
Let's give it another shot! You, me, a solid beat, 
and two completely empty heads!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Pandreo] 
AROOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Alcryst] 
Awooo!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Alcryst] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Pandreo] 
So, Prince Alcryst! What did you think of your 
first party?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 
Why... Why did I think I could do that?!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Hm. I can see how an all-night blowout would 
be kind of overwhelming for a beginner..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alcryst] 
The music was so loud. Everyone was shouting. 
And the dancing─the DANCING!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alcryst] 
It was like a scene from my worst nightmares. 
I shouldn't have joined you. I wasn't ready..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Pandreo] 
Hahaha! Ah, good times."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alcryst] 
Pandreo, please... I don't think I can do that 
again. I'm sorry, but partying is not for me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Pandreo] 
Hey, hey─let's not be too hasty here."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Pandreo] 
I saw you standing on the sidelines─watching 
the action from afar."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Pandreo] 
To really know what it's like, you have to dive 
in and lose yourself with the rest of us."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Pandreo] 
I'll be sure to drag you into the crowd next time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Alcryst] 
No, I can't! I must decline."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Now why would you do that? Don't worry, 
I'll make sure you have fun."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Leave it all to me! AROOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Y-yes. Of course. Awooo..."
