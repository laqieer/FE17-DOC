[Pandreo] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Louis] 1 
[Louis] 
Ahem..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Oh! Sorry, Louis. I didn't see you there."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
I get very focused when I'm praying."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Louis] 
Never fear. I had hoped not to disturb you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Pandreo] 
Did you have a question?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Pandreo] 
I've already told you all the good ""observing"" 
spots I could think of."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Louis] 
No...there is something else on my mind today."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Louis] 
I thought I might ask you to say a prayer... 
for my mother."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Hm. Forgive me if I'm misremembering, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Pandreo] 
I thought your mother passed away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Louis] 
You recall correctly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Louis] 
I was very young then and too devastated to 
do anything but take each day as it came."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Louis] 
Though it embarrasses me to admit that it's 
taken so long to realize this..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Louis] 
I don't believe I ever gave my mother a proper 
send-off amidst all the tumult."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Pandreo] 
I see."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Louis] 
My family were never very deeply religious, 
you see. No offense intended."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, none taken. Religious or not, you wish her a 
peaceful rest. I respect that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Pandreo] 
I'm sure she will be glad to hear that from her 
place in the heavens."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Louis] 
Thank you, Pandreo."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Pandreo] 
Are you sure I'm the right messenger, though?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Pandreo] 
A man of the cloth I may be, but I'm not what 
most would call conventional."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Pandreo] 
You don't think someone else might be 
more suitable?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Louis] 
No. My choice is deliberate."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Louis] 
If someone is going to give her a memorial 
service, I would prefer it to be a dear friend."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Pandreo] 
Gotcha. Well then, I'm happy to help, Louis."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Pandreo] 
Let's pray, shall we? Our guiding soul, who 
art above..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Louis] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Louis] 
Mother... May your soul find peace."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Ow, ow... Ooo, that smarts..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Louis] 
Haha... We may have ""partied hardy"" a bit too 
much last night, wouldn't you say?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Yeah. I tell ya, after so much carousing, I have a 
headache. And an everything-else-ache."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Louis] 
For all that, though, I enjoyed myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Louis] 
It's nice to ""go out with the guys"" every so 
often, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Pandreo] 
I'm glad to hear you say so. That makes this 
full-body migraine worthwhile."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Louis] 
I find that hard partying does give one an 
appetite. Do you like grapes, Pandreo?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Pandreo] 
Sure, I like them all right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Louis] 
In that case, I'll fetch some pastries. The filling 
was made with grapes from my hometown."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Ooh, so it's a local delicacy, huh? Sure, give me 
all you've got!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Louis] 
All I've got?! If you like, but I feel I ought to 
caution you against overindulging."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Pandreo] 
Well, I'm not going to eat it all by myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Pandreo] 
I'm thinking it might be nice to put some treats 
out for my flock."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Louis] 
Oh? You keep animals?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Pandreo] 
My congregation. They like having a casual 
environment to pray and hang out, you know?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Pandreo] 
I'm sure a platter of tasty pastries will bring 
even more people in the door."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Plus, one of my congregants is a merchant. 
He might want to import those grapes of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Louis] 
Ah! Very considerate of you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Louis] 
Always thinking of ways to assist your flock, 
aren't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Pandreo] 
Hahaha! That's my whole job!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Pandreo] 
I might not always look or act like it, but I am 
a man of the cloth."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Louis] 
Hahaha! My doubts have been thoroughly 
laid to rest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Pandreo] 
With all that said, I can't quit partying! You'll 
come with again, right, Louis?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Louis] 
Naturally! I am at your command, Pandreo."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Louis! Are you peeping again?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Louis] 
Pardon me, Pandreo, but I would never do 
anything so gauche as ""peeping."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Louis] 
I prefer to think of it as ""observing from afar."""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Hahaha! Oh, well, excuse me. That's nothing at 
all like peeping."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Pandreo] 
Whatever, bud. If you get bored of...not peeping, 
you're welcome to party hardy with me."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Louis] 
Party...hardy?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Pandreo] 
Yup!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Pandreo] 
You and me can let our hair down and do some 
good old-fashioned male bonding!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Louis] 
Hmm. Male bonding..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Louis] 
I've wondered lately if that may be something 
worth observing firsthand."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Pandreo] 
Well, what do you know! Serendipity."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Louis] 
Quite so."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Louis] 
Pandreo, I would be exceptionally pleased to 
accept your invitation."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Louis] 
Let the two of us explore all the ways in which 
two men may grow ever closer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Pandreo] 
How is it you make everything sound 
suggestive?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Pandreo] 
Anyway, I'm glad you're on board. Though you 
should know I take my partying seriously."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Pandreo] 
We're gonna shimmy and swing till dawn, so 
you can forget about sleeping!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Louis] 
I shall match you measure for measure, 
Pandreo!"
