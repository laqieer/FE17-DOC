[Veyle] 
Oh, Ivy. I need to talk to you about my 
atonement the other day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Veyle] 
I'm so sorry I ate all that yummy food. I just 
couldn't help myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
Why are you still bringing that up? I thought 
for certain we'd resolved this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Veyle] 
But..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Ivy] 
Listen to me, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Ivy] 
My father was corrupted by the Fell Dragon. 
He was coerced down a dark path."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Ivy] 
But that is not in any way your fault."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Ivy] 
You are still unconvinced."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Ivy] 
To be frank...I understand. I'm often told that 
I am not responsible for my father's misdeeds."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Ivy] 
That does not make it any easier to accept."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Veyle] 
I know exactly how you feel."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Ivy] 
It's a bit ridiculous, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Ivy] 
Here I am telling you not to carry the burden 
of your father's actions..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Ivy] 
But I could not accept those same words when 
they were said to me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Ivy] 
Nevertheless... We both need to hear it. And we 
both need to try, as best we can, to believe it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Veyle] 
Oh, Ivy..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Veyle] 
I won't mention making amends to you 
anymore."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Veyle] 
But there is something I wish for."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Veyle] 
I wish you and I could make this world a place 
where people don't carry these awful burdens."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Ivy] 
We share this goal."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Veyle] 
I won't bring up atonement again. I promise."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Veyle] 
I just thought maybe we could help each other... 
since we both know what it's like to suffer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Veyle] 
We could, couldn't we?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Ivy] 
Of course. Absolutely."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Ivy] 
Thank you, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Veyle] 
Thank you, Ivy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Ivy, this is not..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Ivy] 
Too late to take it back─you said you would 
do whatever I asked as penance."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Veyle] 
Yes, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Ivy] 
No excuses."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Ivy] 
To make amends, you must eat this spicy dish. 
And I expect you to clean your plate."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Ivy] 
Has fear rendered you speechless?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Ivy] 
Perhaps I was too harsh. All right─I'll forgive 
you if you can endure a single bite."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Ivy] 
This was your own doing, if you'll recall. I still 
don't believe you have anything to atone for."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Veyle] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Ivy] 
Wait..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Ivy] 
How are you enjoying this so much? I made 
certain it was incredibly spicy."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Veyle] 
I love spicy food!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Ivy] 
You do?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Ivy] 
Father told me you couldn't stand it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Ivy] 
Perhaps I misheard him?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Veyle] 
Oh, it's so yummy. I can't stop eating!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Veyle] 
But this is definitely not a punishment. It's more 
like a reward!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Veyle] 
I love eating this food so much, but I hate not 
making amends for the past."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Ivy] 
No matter."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Ivy] 
If she enjoys it, so much the better."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Ivy] 
She is genuinely moved to tears..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Ivy] 
Your atonement ends here, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Veyle] 
What?! No!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Veyle] 
This can't be it. I'll stop eating this incredible 
food. I will!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#026,"[Ivy] 
No, please finish it. Don't let it go to waste."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#027,"[Ivy] 
Seeing you in pain is not going to bring me any 
closure, you know."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#028,"[Ivy] 
If anything...I think seeing you happy is more 
likely to do it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Veyle] 2 

[Veyle] 
Can I talk to you, Ivy?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Ivy] 
Certainly, Lady Veyle."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Veyle] 
I just want to say, I'm really sorry."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Veyle] 
I'm sorry my papa made your father...go mad."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Ivy] 
Don't do this."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Veyle] 
I understand he was a gentle king who took 
good care of his people and his family, before..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Veyle] 
If it weren't for my father, he'd still be with 
his family─with you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Ivy] 
Please, no more."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Ivy] 
The past is past. There is no use dwelling on it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Veyle] 
I know you feel that way, but I..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Ivy] 
You owe me no apologies. Your father's sins 
are not yours to bear."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Veyle] 
I don't feel like that's true. Please, I have to 
do something."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Ivy] 
Stubborn, aren't you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Ivy] 
In that case, I shall think of some penance you 
can perform when next we meet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Veyle] 
Thank you. I'll do whatever you ask."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Ivy] 
You may come to regret those words."
