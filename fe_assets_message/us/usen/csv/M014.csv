Why fight me, Ivy? All I want is to bring Father 
back. Don't you miss him?"
MID_BT2_#003,"[Ivy] StandBy

Of course. So much, I fear my heart will never 
mend. That's why I cannot lose you too."

Well, if it isn't my favorite lizard! How's Solm 
treating you?"

[Hortensia] 
Ivy, what...happened?"
MID_ED1_#002,"[Ivy] 
Oh, you've come back to me! Thank goodness."
MID_ED1_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Where'd all the Elusian soldiers go?"
MID_ED1_#004,"[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
They retreated."
MID_ED1_#005,"[Hortensia] 
I should go with them..."
MID_ED1_#006,"[Alear] 
No. It's not safe. Zephia could take control over 
you again."
MID_ED1_#007,"[Hortensia] 
But I was the last person left at Elusia Castle. 
Without me, there'll be no one to lead."
MID_ED1_#008,"No one to take care of the country Father 
left behind..."
MID_ED1_#009,"[Ivy] 
That is true... But it's out of our hands."
MID_ED1_#010,"[Hortensia] 
How can you say that? Don't you care about 
Elusia at all?"
MID_ED1_#011,"[Ivy] 
Of course I do. I would have given my life to 
protect our kingdom."
MID_ED1_#012,"But it is not our kingdom anymore. It's the 
Fell Dragon's. Surely you see that."
MID_ED1_#013,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_ED1_#014,"[Alear] 
Princess Ivy..."
MID_ED1_#015,"[Ivy] 
I didn't want to admit it, but Father stopped 
being king as soon as the Fell Dragon awoke."
MID_ED1_#016,"Since then true power has rested with Sombron, 
his daughter, and the Four Hounds."
MID_ED1_#017,"If you went back now, you would become an 
instrument of their designs─just as Father was."
MID_ED1_#018,"[Hortensia] 
I..."
MID_ED1_#019,"[Ivy] 
I want to go home too. You have no idea 
how badly."
MID_ED1_#020,"But there's no home to go back to until we 
defeat the Fell Dragon."
MID_ED1_#021,"After allowing Father to relinquish his power to 
Sombron, we owe our people no less."
MID_ED1_#022,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_ED1_#023,"The castle. My only home since I was little... 
We really can't go back now, can we?"
MID_ED1_#024,"[Ivy] 
No... We can't."
MID_ED1_#025,"[Hortensia] 
That little nook where I had tea with my friends. 
The garden where you and I read together..."
MID_ED1_#026,"Even Rosado and Goldmary. I've left everything 
and everyone behind."
MID_ED1_#027,"All right, Ivy. I'll join this fight. So that someday, 
things can be like they were again."
MID_ED1_#028,"[Ivy] 
Thank you, Hortensia."
MID_ED1_#029,"[Hortensia] 
I'm really sorry for...for what I did. Divine One? 
You should have this."
MID_ED1_#030,"[Alear] 
The Ring of the Instructor. One of the rings 
stolen from Lythos. Thank you for returning it."
MID_ED1_#031,"[Hortensia] 
Don't give me too much credit. I wasn't exactly 
planning to hand it over."
MID_ED1_#032,"[Alear] 
Even so, you have my thanks."
MID_ED1_#033,"Teach us, Emblem of the Academy!"
MID_ED2_#001,"[Byleth] 1

I am Emblem Byleth. It feels as though I've just 
awoken from a very long dream..."

my power to guide everyone."
MID_ED2_#003,"[Alear] 
I will. Thank you, Emblem Byleth."

So, how is everyone?"
MID_ED3_#002,"[Alear] 
Queen Seforia, you're all right!"
MID_ED3_#003,"[Seforia] 
That I am. Some Elusian soldiers tried to seize 
me, but I was saved at just the right moment."
MID_ED3_#004,"[Timerra] 3

We took 'em down."
MID_ED3_#005,"[Diamant] 4

But by the time we'd drawn our weapons, the 
fight was already over."
MID_ED3_#007,"[Timerra] 
Haha! That's the Solm royal guard for ya. 
Pretty good, right?"
MID_ED3_#008,"[Alear] 
I'm just glad the queen is safe. Well 
done, everyone."
MID_ED3_#009,"[Seforia] 
Well done yourself. No more trespassers. My 
palace is rid of them."
MID_ED3_#010,"Divine One, thank you for protecting the rings 
and my family with such courage."
MID_ED3_#011,"The way you spoke, the look in your eyes... 
You were the spitting image of Queen Lumera."
MID_ED3_#012,"[Alear]

Um, excuse me, Queen Seforia?"
MID_ED3_#015,"[Seforia] 
You. I assumed you'd gone back to Elusia."
MID_ED3_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Look, I'm really sorry about what I did. I'll 
accept whatever punishment you give me."
MID_ED3_#017,"[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
I owe you an apology as well."
MID_ED3_#018,"[Seforia] 
..."
MID_ED3_#019,"[Alear] 3 

[Alear] 
Queen Seforia, please. Zephia was using some 
sort of magic to control Princess Hortensia."
MID_ED3_#020,"As soon as it wore off, she stopped fighting─ 
even gave me her Emblem Ring."
MID_ED3_#021,"[Seforia] 
I don't recall Zephia being there when the 
young princess held me hostage."
MID_ED3_#022,"Look me in the eyes, you two."
MID_ED3_#023,"[Hortensia] 
OK..."
MID_ED3_#024,"[Seforia] 
Threatening a queen's life is a grave crime. You 
deserve a room in the dungeons."
MID_ED3_#025,But...I won't send you there.
MID_ED3_#026,"[Hortensia] 
You...won't?"
MID_ED3_#027,"[Seforia] 
It was the Fell Dragon's minions who broke in 
and started the conflict, right?"
MID_ED3_#028,"Your only crimes were slipping in uninvited... 
and threatening to kill me."
MID_ED3_#029,"If you want to make amends, defeat the 
Fell Dragon. Rebuild your kingdom."
MID_ED3_#030,"When cooler heads return to Elusia, Solm can 
only benefit. Let's move on now, shall we?"
MID_ED3_#031,"[Hortensia] 
Thank you, Queen Seforia."
MID_ED3_#032,"[Ivy] 
Your show of compassion will not be forgotten. 
We will restore Elusia. I swear it."
MID_ED3_#033,"[Seforia] 
For my part, I think I'd better look into shoring 
up the palace's defenses."
MID_ED3_#034,"[Alear] 
You're right. The Fell Dragon's forces might 
come back for you..."
MID_ED3_#035,"I can leave some soldiers here to help keep 
you safe."
MID_ED3_#036,"[Seforia] 
Oh, no need, no need. I have lots of family 
members who can handle things here."
MID_ED3_#037,"If the situation really boils over, I can always 
leave a double here and wander the land."
MID_ED3_#038,"So don't worry about me. You just focus on 
taking out the Fell Dragon."
MID_ED3_#039,"[Alear] 
We will. Thank you."
MID_ED3_#040,"[Seforia] 
Timerra, it's time you showed the Divine 
Dragon where to find Solm's other ring."
MID_ED3_#041,"[Hortensia] 

[Timerra] 4 

[Timerra] 
Sure thing, Mom. One Ring of the Crux of Fate, 
coming right up!"
MID_ED3_#042,"[Alear] 
Where is it?"
MID_ED3_#043,"[Timerra] 
The Northern Fortress. Oh... You don't scare 
easily, do you?"
MID_ED4_#001,"[Veyle] 白 悪 2

MID_ED4_#002,"Another ring in the Divine Dragon's hands. 
Still, not enough to turn the tide."
MID_ED4_#003,Urgh...
MID_ED4_#004,"I must sleep. Curse this feeble form of mine for 
plunging me into darkness."
MID_ED4_#005,"I pray that next time, my waking hours will not 
end so soon."

Finally! Took you long enough."
MID_OP1_#003,"[Timerra] 
Let her go."
MID_OP1_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Yeah, I don't think so. And don't you dare come 
any closer."
MID_OP1_#005,"I've got an Emblem Ring. It'd be so easy to 
kill her."
MID_OP1_#006,"[Timerra] 
..."
MID_OP1_#007,"[Seforia] 
Sorry, everyone. I didn't realize she was still on 
Elusia's side."
MID_OP1_#008,"[Alear] 
I don't see any other soldiers. Did you get in 
by yourself?"
MID_OP1_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Uh-huh. I told the guards I'd been separated 
from Ivy, and they let me walk right in."
MID_OP1_#010,"Now, you've got a choice: hand over the rings 
or I kill the queen."
MID_OP1_#011,"[Timerra] 
[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
Hortensia, don't do this."
MID_OP1_#012,"[Hortensia] 
Ivy! It's been a while... You know, I... I thought 
you were dead."
MID_OP1_#013,"I was so relieved when I heard you'd made it. 
But...now what? You're with them?"
MID_OP1_#014,"[Ivy] 
Well, I..."
MID_OP1_#015,"[Hortensia] 
Since Father sacrificed himself, Elusia has been 
working in concert with Lord Sombron."
MID_OP1_#016,"But you? You abandoned us─abandoned me─ 
and took sides with the enemy."
MID_OP1_#017,"You're a traitor, Ivy! A stinking traitor!"
MID_OP1_#018,"[Ivy] 
I have not betrayed anyone. Hortensia, please, 
hear me out."
MID_OP1_#019,"[Hortensia] 
I don't wanna hear another word out of your 
dirty, double-crossing mouth! Just give me 
the rings."
MID_OP1_#020,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_OP1_#021,"No, Hortensia. Never."
MID_OP1_#022,"[Hortensia] 
I'm sorry, did I not make myself clear? Hand 
them over or I kill the queen."
MID_OP1_#023,"[Alear] 
I heard you. But I'm not doing what you ask."
MID_OP1_#024,"I'd be throwing away everything she, Timerra, 
Fogado, and the people of Solm have done."
MID_OP1_#025,"So no, I won't give you the rings. And I won't 
let you kill Queen Seforia."
MID_OP1_#026,"[Hortensia] 
Ugh!"
MID_OP1_#027,"[Ivy] 

[Timerra] 2 

[Timerra] 
I agree with the Divine Dragon. Those rings are 
staying with us."
MID_OP1_#028,"[Alear] 4 

[Alear] 
Right."
MID_OP1_#029,"[Timerra] 
If we let the Fell Dragon have them, my country 
and my people are doomed."
MID_OP1_#030,"So threaten us all you want. Take my whole 
family hostage, if it makes you happy."
MID_OP1_#031,"But I stand for Solm, and I always will."
MID_OP1_#032,"[Seforia] 
There she is, the future queen of Solm. 
And her ally, the Divine Dragon."
MID_OP1_#033,"[Hortensia] 
What's wrong with you?! This is your mother! 
You're supposed to be scared!"
MID_OP1_#034,"Cry already! Cower and beg for her life! Give me 
what I want!"
MID_OP1_#035,"No, what I need. I need the rings. It's the only 
way to bring Father back."
MID_OP1_#036,"[Alear] 
[Ivy] 4 

[Ivy] 
Hortensia... He's gone. The Fell Dragon 
murdered him. You watched it happen."
MID_OP1_#037,"There's no way we can bring him back, even 
with the rings."
MID_OP1_#038,"[Hortensia] 
You don't know that! I have to try! I have to 
save Father and Elusia!"
MID_OP1_#039,"Everything's all wrong now. I just want to put it 
back how it was before!"
MID_OP1_#040,"[Ivy] 
I know how you feel."
MID_OP1_#041,"[Hortensia] 
No! Stop trying to get in my head, all right? 
I'll kill her! I'll do it!"
MID_OP1_#042,"[Timerra] 
[Alear] 2 

[Alear] 
I don't think you can."
MID_OP1_#043,Not if you know the pain of losing a parent.
MID_OP1_#044,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_OP1_#045,"[Seforia] 
Well? Get on with it, then, if that's what you 
truly want. Are we doing this or aren't we?"
MID_OP1_#046,"[Hortensia] 
I... I..."
MID_OP1_#047,Whaaa!
MID_OP1_#048,"[Alear] 
She needs her sister now."
MID_OP1_#049,"[Ivy] 
It's all right, Hortensia. Oh, I've been so worried 
about you."

MID_OP2_#002,"[Alear] 
Zephia. What are you doing here?"
MID_OP2_#003,"[Zephia] 
Missed you, too, Divine One. I must thank you 
for helping us gather so many rings."
MID_OP2_#004,"All of them, I thought. Until the princess's─ 
rather former princess's─thievery came to light."
MID_OP2_#005,"[Ivy] 
..."
MID_OP2_#006,"[Zephia] 
Enough about that. More importantly... 
Princess Hortensia..."
MID_OP2_#007,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_OP2_#008,"[Zephia] 
Taking a ring without permission? Sneaking off 
to a place like this? Naughty, naughty."
MID_OP2_#009,"Lord Sombron and Lady Veyle's orders were 
clear─to wait, to watch."
MID_OP2_#010,"Oh, your retainers, by the way? They tried to 
stop us. They failed."
MID_OP2_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Where are they? What did you do to Goldmary 
and Rosado?"
MID_OP2_#012,"[Zephia] 
You'll have to see for yourself. Now, we hadn't 
planned on making a move this early."
MID_OP2_#013,"But since we're here, it would be a shame to 
return home without a few souvenirs."
MID_OP2_#014,Marni? Mauvier? Wouldn't you agree?

the impregnable Solm Palace."
MID_OP3_#003,"[Marni] 
Zephia, what do we do with the queen? Kill her? 
She's not much use anymore."
MID_OP3_#004,"[Mauvier] 
[Zephia] 1 
[Zephia] 
No. Lord Sombron will want to savor every last 
drop of sovereign blood."

Ah! Haha, I gotcha."

coming here to get rings for Lord Sombron."
MID_OP4_#003,"Now that the three of us are here, why don't we 
help finish what you started."
MID_OP4_#004,"We can kill them all and head back home to 
Elusia. What do you say?"
MID_OP4_#005,"[Hortensia] 
But... But I..."
MID_OP4_#006,"[Zephia] 
Come, dear. Take command."
MID_OP4_#007,"Just think. If we take their rings, we'll be so 
close to having all 12."
MID_OP4_#008,"[Hortensia] 
So close... Just a few more rings..."
MID_OP4_#009,"[Alear] 
Hortensia? What's going on?"
MID_OP4_#010,"[Hortensia] 
With all the rings, then Father will..."
MID_OP4_#011,"[Zephia] 
That's right. King Hyacinth will be resurrected. 
We'll make everything just as it was before."
MID_OP4_#012,"[Hortensia] 
Just as it was...before..."
MID_OP4_#013,"[Hortensia] 
[Hortensia] 3 
[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_OP4_#014,"I will kill them all. I will take their rings. It's the 
only way to save Father."
MID_OP4_#015,"[Alear] 
Is she really going to fight us?"
MID_OP4_#016,"[Ivy] 
Hortensia, snap out of it, please! Hortensia!"
MID_OP4_#017,"[Zephia] 
She can't hear you, unfortunately. Enjoy killing 
one another, won't you?"
