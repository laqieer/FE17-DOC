[Pandreo] 
Pinch me. I mean, did that really happen?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Did I just go to a party with the actual 
Divine Dragon?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alear] 
I was glad to see everyone having a good time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Pandreo] 
You gave them a reason to hold on to hope. 
I can't thank you enough for that."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Alear] 
I should be thanking you. All the music and 
merriment really did lift my spirits."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alear] 
I'm feeling more hopeful myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Pandreo] 
And what did I tell you? Not one disappointed 
face in the house."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Alear] 
True. I almost feel embarrassed that I passed 
on your invitation at first."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alear] 
I owe it to those people to stay strong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Pandreo] 
One day you'll bring peace to the world."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Pandreo] 
And I'll help in whatever small way I can. 
Together, we'll lead everyone to a better future."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alear] 
Oh, I almost forgot. I have to ask you 
about something."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Of course. What is it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alear] 
At one point, everyone started...howling. 
What was that all about?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Pandreo] 
Oooh, uh... Em... That...um..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Pandreo] 
That's just a way members of my congregation 
express their fervor. A little crass, I know."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Please erase it from your memory."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alear] 
Sure thing! AROOO!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Pandreo] 
Divine One, please!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alear] 
Hahah! Ooh, that was fun! Now I get the appeal!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Alear] 
Pandreo...I'm sorry, but after thinking about it, 
I'm going to pass on the party invitation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Pandreo] 
Ah, your schedule's full? That's too bad. 
Maybe next time."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alear] 
No, it's not about my schedule."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Pandreo] 
Oh. Then can I ask why?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alear] 
From a distance, people may see me as a... 
a god. But up close, I'm nothing special."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alear] 
Why disappoint everyone by letting them find 
out that the Divine Dragon is just...a person?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Pandreo] 
That's what you're worried about? I must have 
given you the wrong impression."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Pandreo] 
Listen. When I was a boy, you saved my life."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Alear] 
What? How? I was asleep."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Well, my parents were...scummy, frankly. They 
left my sister and me when we were little."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Pandreo] 
But a priest at the church turned my life around 
with a little-known prophecy..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Pandreo] 
""When the dragon child rises from their slumber 
on the dais, saved the world will be."""
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Alear] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Screwed up as the world got, it would be saved. 
That gave me the hope I needed to keep going."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Pandreo] 
And I'm not alone. The faithful have always 
believed that you would awaken."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Pandreo] 
So no, you won't disappoint them. You're living 
proof that their hopes are coming to pass."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Alear] 
I understand now."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Alear] 
All right, Pandreo. You've convinced me. 
I'll come to that party of yours."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Pandreo] 
Thank you, thank you! Everyone will be thrilled 
to see you there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Pandreo] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Ah, Divine One! Just the dragon I was hoping 
to see. I could use a favor."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Oh? What kind of favor?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Pandreo] 
I'm hosting a party soon, and I'd like for you to 
be there."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Pandreo] 
At our church, you're the center of our 
everything─our deity!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Pandreo] 
I think your attendance would really raise 
everyone's spirits."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Alear] 
Hmm. Tell me more about this party. What is it 
going to be like?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Pandreo] 
Oh, nothing formal. Just an occasion to sing, 
dance, and have a good time."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Pandreo] 
You can blow off some steam and lend an ear to 
the other guests. Hear their stories."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Alear] 
That sounds fun, but... What does my listening 
to people have to do with anything?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Pandreo] 
Don't you see? It would be incredibly 
encouraging to everyone!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Pandreo] 
The first time I saw you with my own eyes was 
like...like seeing the light!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alear] 
Haha, you're coming on a little strong."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Pandreo] 
Excuse me. Got a little intense there, didn't I!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Pandreo] 
Anyway...it's short notice, so there's no need to 
let me know right away."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Pandreo] 
But I'll tell you, I don't throw so-so parties. 
If I'm hosting it, you know it'll be a blowout."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alear] 
OK. I'll keep that in mind."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Pandreo] 
Thank you, Divine One."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Pandreo] 2"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#002,"[Alear] 
AROOO! Hey there, Pandreo."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#003,"[Pandreo] 
Divine One! I wish you wouldn't do the whole 
howling thing. It's so beneath you."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#004,"[Alear] 
OK, OK, if you say so."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#005,"[Alear] 
Anyway, what's going on?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#006,"[Pandreo] 
Well, there's something I'd like to talk to 
you about."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#007,"[Pandreo] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#008,"[Pandreo] 
I guess I'll just say it... I have feelings for 
you, ."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#009,"[Alear] 
What?! Where did this come from all of 
a sudden?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#010,"[Pandreo] 
There's nothing sudden about it. I've felt like 
this for a long time."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#011,"[Pandreo] 
I know it must be sacrilegious─a cleric caring 
this much for someone as holy as you..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#012,"[Pandreo] 
But as a man of the cloth, I don't feel right 
hiding this secret."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#013,"[Pandreo] 
And it's OK, Divine One. I know you can't 
commit yourself to a humble cleric like me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#014,"[Pandreo] 
I just appreciate you hearing what I had to say, 
self-indulgent as it was. I should go now."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#015,"[Alear] 
Please, wait."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#016,"[Pandreo] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#017,"[Alear] 
Who says a Divine Dragon and a cleric can't 
commit themselves to each other? Tell me."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#018,"[Pandreo] 
That would be...um..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#019,"[Alear] 
Please, Pandreo. You helped me understand 
something important..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#020,"[Alear] 
You helped me understand what I mean to 
people and what my role in all of this truly is."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#021,"[Alear] 
You made me feel connected."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#022,"[Alear] 
You are so precious to me. And yet, you say 
I'm not allowed to feel like this?"
MID_RELIANCE_S_#023,"[Pandreo] 
Divine One..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#024,"[Pandreo] 
No. No one can tell you how to feel or how not 
to feel. No one."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#025,"[Alear] 
Then please, take this. It's the Pact Ring. I want 
you to wear it. I want you to be by my side."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#026,"[Pandreo] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#027,"[Pandreo] 
If that's what you want from me..."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#028,"[Alear] 
Yes, Pandreo. That's what I want."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#029,"[Pandreo] 
Did you feel that? Everything got just 
a bit brighter."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#030,"[Alear] 
Maybe that's my mother. Maybe she's letting us 
know how happy this makes her."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#031,"[Pandreo] 
Queen Lumera? I hope so."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#032,"[Alear] 
When two people have feelings for each other 
like we do, that can't be forbidden or denied."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#033,"[Alear] 
You and I will walk hand-in-hand together 
from now on."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#034,"[Pandreo] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_S_#035,"[Pandreo] 
Divine One, I adore you. And no matter what 
lies ahead, I will never let go of your hand."
