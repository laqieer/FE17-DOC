[Roy] 2 
[Alfred] 
Up and at 'em, Roy! It's dawn─the perfect time 
for a workout."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Roy] 
I admire your enthusiasm, but don't you think 
this is a little early?"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Alfred] 
Nonsense. The early bird catches the worm, and 
our muscles are ready to feast!"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Roy] 
I'm not sure that's true, but you're the expert. 
Let's get to work!"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Alfred? Do you need something? I can feel you 
staring a hole in me."
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Alfred] 
I can't help it─you've got some serious muscle! 
I have to know what your workouts are like."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Alfred] 
Our allies in Brodia were sitting on a pretty 
powerful Emblem. Can't wait to work with you."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Roy] 
You seem like a worthy ally yourself. I'm eager 
to fight by your side."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Anna] 
Aw... This is bad."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Roy] 
What's wrong? You look like you just lost 
a fortune."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Anna] 
I thought this stuff would fly off the shelves, 
but it's all dead stock. What do I do?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Roy] 
As a merchant once told me, ""time is money."" 
The quicker we get friends to help, the better!"
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Anna] 
Word is that there's a festival coming up. 
Wanna go together? It'll be fun!"
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Roy] 
A festival sounds like a great chance to see 
everyone at peace for a change. I'd love to go!"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Anna] 
Hey, Roy. We've got some great stuff in stock! 
Buy some and I might even give you a discount."
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Roy] 
That's nice of you, but I'm an Emblem, so I 
don't actually carry money. Sorry about that."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Bunet] 
Roy, look. This flower─the color is quite 
beautiful, don't you think?"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Yes, it is─very. Is it a favorite flower of yours?"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
It's the chili-pepper flower. I thought you'd like 
looking at it, since you can't taste the pepper."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Roy] 
That's very thoughtful of you, Bunet. Thank you 
for helping me taste the chili, at least in spirit."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Bunet] 
I created a new dish inspired by you, Roy. 
Please, have a look."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Roy] 
Let me guess, you used chili peppers? That red 
color is a dead giveaway. Whoa, looks spicy!"
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Bunet] 
That hair of yours, it's the color of a fine chili 
pepper. I wonder if it tastes as fiery as it looks."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Roy] 
My hair looks like a chili pepper? Thank you, 
I guess..."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
That was a close call when we got separated 
from everyone, huh?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
I could swear we'd gone in a straight line, but 
before I knew it, we were lost in the woods."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Good thing you were there to point out the 
road. I don't know what I'd do without you."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Roy] 
It was no problem. I'll guide you down whatever 
path you want, Boucheron."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
You like reading, don't you? Are there any 
books you'd recommend?"
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Oh, you're a reader too? Now, let's see... I could 
maybe narrow it down to 50 or so good ones."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Boucheron] 
So, you came out of this ring? Huh, feels like 
wonders never cease."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Roy] 
That's how an Emblem works. Anyway, I'm 
glad to get to know another ally."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Céline] 
You're more than a fighter. You're an excellent 
strategist and commander too. Most impressive."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Roy] 
I had to study hard to be a successful lord. 
I was schooled at the largest city in my nation."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Céline] 
I've had an eclectic education, but you are proof 
there are gaps in my lessons."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Well, experience counts for a lot too. There's 
no classroom like the battlefield."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Hey, Céline. Do I smell a new type of tea?"
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Céline] 
Yes, I've come into some new leaves. Shall we 
enjoy their fragrance together?"
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Céline] 
We shall be leaning heavily on your might in our 
quest for peace."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Roy] 
It's a cause I'm happy to fight for. And you're 
an ally I'm happy to have."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Chloé] 
Do you have any favorite stories, Roy? I bet 
you'd like tales of dashing heroes."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Hmm. I can think of a few. The best for me are 
the ones with happy endings."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
I like uplifting stories too. I hope that's how our 
quest to bring peace to the world turns out."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Roy] 
So do I. And the good news is that if we work 
hard enough, we'll get to write our own ending."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
That's a lot of food. Is it all for you?"
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Chloé] 
I couldn't decide on just one thing from the 
market stalls, so I got a little of everything."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Chloé] 
I can't believe I'm fighting alongside an Emblem. 
It feels too much like a fairy tale to be true."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Even so, it's real. I'm here and ready to help 
all of you in whatever way I can."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I come from a kingdom of warriors, yet I'm so 
weak... I wish I could just buy physical strength."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Haven't you noticed yet, Citrinne? You've 
grown much stronger since we first met."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
Really? You honestly think so, Roy?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Roy] 
You can't buy the kind of experience you found 
on the battlefield─and we're not done yet."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Tell me, Roy...is there anything you want? 
Let me buy you a token of our friendship."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Roy] 
I guess there is one thing... I have no skill with 
magic. Could you give me a few lessons?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Such a wonderful person hiding in Brodia's ring 
all that time! I'm so happy I get to meet you."
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I'm happy to see you too, Citrinne. Let's pool 
our strength and give it everything we've got!"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Clanne] 
Lord Roy... Do you think I'm becoming strong 
enough to protect the Divine Dragon?"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Of course. Every time I fight beside you, I see 
you grow stronger."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
Lord Roy thinks I'm strong! Oh my gosh. I'm so 
happy I might faint!"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Work hard, and you'll get even stronger. That 
sounds like a Divine Dragon Fan Club slogan."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Clanne] 
Um... Lord Roy? I was wondering... Would you 
like to join our Divine Dragon fan club?"
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Roy] 
Well, first I need you to explain what a 
""fan club"" is, and then I'll let you know."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
You've been here at the Somniel for a long time. 
Can you tell me more about this place, Clanne?"
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Tell you about... That is─ Yes, of course! 
Oh, wow, Lord Roy asked me for something!"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Diamant] 
Your appearance from the ring was a surprise, 
but I think I could sense your presence in there."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Roy] 
That's a nice thing to hear. I was glad I could 
finally speak with you, face to face."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
We fight well together too. Let's just hope our 
combined strength is enough to usher in peace."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Roy] 
I hope for the same thing, Diamant. And I'm 
sure it will be. We'll give it everything we have."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Diamant] 
You studied the art of statecraft, right, Roy? 
I know I could learn some things from you..."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Roy] 
All I've ever learned is how to act like a lord. 
As long as it involves that, I'm happy to share."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Diamant] 
Your ring was entrusted to my kingdom, Roy... 
so Brodia will be relying on your power."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I hoped this day would come. Leave it to me. 
Together, we'll bring peace to your kingdom."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
You seem pleased, Etie. Did you get some 
good news?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Etie] 
No, I got some good meat. Nothing but the best 
food for my muscles!"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Roy] 
Meat's how you help build muscle, huh?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Etie] 
Obviously my weight training and daily runs 
played a part. Speaking of which, be back soon!"
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Did you pick these flowers? They're beautiful."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Etie] 
Thanks. They bloom all over my hometown."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
You're always so confident, Etie. Doesn't 
anything worry you at all?"
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Etie] 
Does worrying solve anything? No. Plus, I have 
exercise to clear my mind when I start to doubt."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Fogado] 
Hey, remember that village we saved from the 
monsters? The folks there are throwing a feast!"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Roy] 
That's great, Fogado. You should go."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
What? The only reason we won was because of 
your power. You've gotta come too!"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Oh, I see! Well then, I'd be more than happy to 
join in the festivities."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Fogado] 
I'm a man of many talents but one thing I can't 
do is fish. You Emblems have any secret tips?"
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Roy] 
No, but there are skills anyone can learn. You 
practice, and I'll try to give you some pointers."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Fogado] 
Roy, I'd like to be able to call on your strength 
when I'm fighting as a Sentinel. But is that OK?"
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Roy] 
More than OK, Fogado. Anything you need, just 
say the word."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Framme] 
So many folks are stronger than I am, Lord Roy. 
What if I can't protect the Divine Dragon?"
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Roy] 
You are strong, Framme, and you are very good 
at taking care of the Divine One."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Roy] 
Besides, there are some things only you can do. 
Your enthusiastic support is a powerful thing."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Framme] 
OK! I'm gonna put all I've got into protecting 
the Divine Dragon. Just you wait and see!"
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Framme, that food you're always carrying 
around... What is it?"
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Framme] 
Beets! They're super-duper nutritious, and 
they're my very favorite."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Framme] 
If you and I combined our strength, Lord Roy, 
no one could possibly beat us. So, let's do it!"
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I like the confidence, Framme. Just never let 
your guard down, all right?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Goldmary] 
Could I ask a favor of you, Roy?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Of course. I'll help any way I can."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
I've heard of a delightful hot spring I'd like to 
visit. Would you accompany me?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Must be in a dangerous area if you need an 
escort. Don't worry─I'll get you there safely."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Everything you cook looks delicious, Goldmary. 
Really makes me wish I could eat."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
I suppose you'll have to content yourself 
with the aroma."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Goldmary] 
I like having you around, Roy. Your strength 
complements my sophistication."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Uh, sure. Yeah, we work well together."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Hortensia] 
It's time, Roy! Let's go show 'em how well 
we fight!"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Haha, I like your energy. I bet you're strong 
enough to take things on, all on your own."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Oh. I thought you liked hanging out with 
me, though..."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Hortensia, I'm always happy to spend time with 
you. Let's do it."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Hortensia] 
You're quite the charmer, Roy. I'll bet lots 
of people have been taken with you."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Roy] 
You think? That's kind of you to say..."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Hortensia] 
You're Brodia's Emblem? You're so beautiful. 
My impression of Brodia was wrong."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Thanks, Hortensia. I'm glad to hear that."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Ivy] 
With you by my side, everything is much easier 
somehow. I must say, it's quite a relief."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Roy] 
I'm glad to hear that. I know there were some 
complicated feelings for us to work through."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Ivy] 
That we did so is thanks to your goodness. I can 
only hope to be as strong and kind one day."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Roy] 
You're more than strong enough, Ivy. But if you 
ever feel unsure, remember I'll be by your side."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Ivy] 
Thank you for staying with me. Your acceptance 
has done much to ease my guilt."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Roy] 
It's my pleasure. I'm glad we're growing 
to trust each other."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Ivy] 
Are you willing to fight alongside me, Roy? 
Even after what I did to the king of Brodia?"
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Of course I am. King Morion's death wasn't 
your fault."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Jade] 
I've noticed that you enjoy books and stories, 
Roy. Is that true?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Roy] 
I do. Stories teach the best lessons, after all. 
Oh! That's right─you're a writer, aren't you?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Jade] 
I am. In fact, I've written something that I'd like 
to run by you. I need to field-test a few jokes."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Great! I can start reading it right now, if you 
wouldn't mind turning the pages for me."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Jade! I saw some kind of mineral earlier. Could 
you help me identify it based on a description?"
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Jade] 
Of course. I can identify any mineral out there. 
To start, let's talk about color and luster."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Uh, Jade? What's wrong? You've been giving 
me a peculiar look for a while now."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Jade] 
Hush. Don't say anything. I'm on the verge of a 
breakthrough for the plot of my next book."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Your medical know-how has been a big help. 
You've clearly been studying."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Jean] 
Thanks, Roy! I still have a long way to go before 
I'm a real doctor, though."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Roy] 
Now you're being humble. We'll need those 
skills of yours in our fight for peace."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Jean] 
Right! I'll keep studying and working hard to 
make my home island proud!"
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Jean] 
Roy, would you say I'm getting better out on 
the battlefield?"
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Roy] 
Oh, absolutely. In fact, I feel like I need to work 
even harder just to keep up."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Jean] 
With you on our side, Roy, I know we can save 
so many more people!"
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I'll try to live up to your expectations. Hopefully 
I can fight hard enough to make a difference."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Our bond has grown deep indeed! I care for you 
very much, Roy. Do you feel the same?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Sure. I've really come to respect you. Your 
dedication to learning and growing amazes me."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
That is very kind! You are reaffirming that my 
affection for you is not misplaced."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Roy] 
I've never met anyone as enthusiastic about 
friendship as you, Kagetsu. It's taught me a lot."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Roy! I wish to know you more intimately off 
the battlefield. Engage with me now!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Roy] 
Oh, you mean you want to practice the─ 
Wait, now? Right now?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Roy! You and I will be fighting as one. This will 
surely lead to strong bonds of friendship!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Right. I mean, I hope so. I look forward 
to working with you, Kagetsu."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Lapis] 
Hey, Roy? I wanted to thank you for lending 
me your strength all the time...so I, uh..."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Why so formal? No need to thank me. I'm just 
doing what needs to be done."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Roy] 
Wait, what's that you've got there?"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Lapis] 
I wanted to commemorate our time battling as a 
team, so I made a doll of you! Wanna hold it?"
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Lapis] 
I'm stronger than usual when I'm with you, Roy. 
Any chance you used to train by fighting bears?"
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Roy] 
Fighting Bern? Of course. I battled their forces 
all the time... Wait, did you say ""Bern""?"
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Lapis] 
I get to fight beside Brodia's national treasure. 
What an honor! I'm looking forward to this, Roy!"
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Roy] 
No need to be that humble, Lapis. We both fight 
for peace...and I'm looking forward to it as well."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Lindon! I just heard a loud noise. 
Is everything OK?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Lindon] 
Oh, just a failed magical experiment. I think 
I learned something at least!"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Roy] 
Never mind that─the fire's going to spread if 
we don't put it out quickly!"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Lindon] 
So it will. Roy, your job is to figure out a way to 
keep the fire at bay while I fetch some water."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Is that another book? You really like reading, 
don't you?"
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Lindon] 
I do. Even at my age, there's a lot to learn from 
books. Would you like me to read to you?"
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Lindon] 
What type of magic coaxes an Emblem from its 
ring, I wonder? Maybe I should experiment."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I don't know if I like the way you say 
""experiment""..."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
What's got you in such a good mood, Louis?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Louis] 
In truth, Roy, I observed a group of people in 
town who were having a grand time."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Louis] 
They were laughing, smiling, dancing... It must 
be wonderful to have that kind of friendship."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Roy] 
That does sound wonderful. Remember their 
faces as we fight for peace."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Are those grapes? They smell delicious."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Louis] 
My hometown is famous for them. They're not 
just tasty, but healthy as well. A perfect plant."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Louis] 
Do you know what I noticed, Roy? Both our 
names are vowels bookended by consonants."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Huh. So they are. Well, that aside, shall we get 
back to saving the world?"
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Alear] 
You know what I like about you? The way you 
never give up, no matter how dire things get."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Roy] 
When I see people who need help, I feel that 
I have to do all I can for them. That's all it is."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Alear] 
Not everyone feels that way, though. It's an 
outlook I could always learn from."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Roy] 
If you admire that way of thinking, you already 
have it. I'm happy to call you an ally."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
You've improved a great deal. You've got the 
makings of a very promising warrior."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Alear] 
You know, I never truly felt that way until I 
heard it from you."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Alear] 
You have considerable strength, Roy. It's no 
wonder they gave you to Brodia to keep safe."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Roy] 
You flatter me. I'm just happy to be working 
with you now to bring about peace."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Serving alongside you, I've come to know a kind 
and gentle man, despite your own claims."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Mauvier] 
I cannot bear to see the weak suffer, knowing 
I might have the power to save them."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Roy] 
Many would agree, but few take those words to 
heart as you do. I respect you for that."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Mauvier] 
Thank you. You have reminded me that not all 
of my choices have been mistakes."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Are you training again? Please consider taking 
a break. It's unhealthy to push yourself."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Mauvier] 
A...break? What should one do during a break?"
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Sir Roy of the Emblems. It is a proud honor to 
fight alongside you."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I feel the same about you. It is rare indeed to be 
so proud of a fellow soldier."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
What are you doing, Merrin? All those poses... 
Are they part of a new training regimen?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Merrin] 
Oh no, not at all, Sir Roy. I'm just working on 
my signature pose."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Roy] 
Your...signature pose? Why would you need 
something like that?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
To look cool, of course. But hey, I'm working on 
one for you too. You'll look amazing in battle!"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
In my world, we don't have giant wolves like 
the one you ride. I find them very fascinating."
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Merrin] 
So, you have an interest in animals? Wonderful! 
I'll go get my encyclopedia of rare critters!"
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Merrin] 
I want to become a more powerful knight. Sir 
Roy, please, help me. Lend me your strength."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I would be glad to, Merrin. I'll work with you for 
as long as you'll have me."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
I'm curious, Timerra, what keeps you fighting 
in this war?"
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Timerra] 
When I traveled all over, I met lots of people and 
saw how they lived. They were good people."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Timerra] 
I want to protect them, their way of life, their 
smiling faces. I want to help however I can."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Roy] 
That's very admirable. I promise, we'll work 
together to keep those people safe."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Timerra] 
I'm so glad you came to the rescue, Roy. I even 
wrote a thank-you song. You've gotta hear it!"
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Roy] 
I'm told you have an amazing singing voice. I'm 
looking forward to finally hearing it for myself."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
So, Timerra, you're a princess and also a 
Sentinel? It sounds like I'm in capable hands."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Timerra] 
Thanks and right back at ya. I mean, you are the 
Emblem from Brodia, the Kingdom of Warriors."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Pandreo] 
I want to hold a party to honor you, Lord Roy, 
just as you honor me with your support."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Roy] 
You don't need to do that. Working with all of 
you to achieve peace─that's enough for me."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
You're too kind...which is why I wanted to 
throw you a party in the first place!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Roy] 
All right, it sounds like fun. Perhaps you could 
debut your new prayer dance at the party!"
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Pandreo] 
I'm working on a new prayer dance, but it just 
isn't worship-y enough. Any words of advice?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Roy] 
I'm not sure I'm the best person to ask. But if 
you like, I can take a look. Go ahead; let's see it."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Lord Roy, I thank you for lending me your 
strength. As a cleric, I am deeply honored."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Oh, you don't have to bow or anything like that, 
Pandreo. We're equals here."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Don't you want to take a break? It's so late, and 
yet here you are, still training."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Panette] 
Oh, no. I must grow stronger if I hope to help 
bring about peace."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Roy] 
You are strong and dedicated too. I consider it 
an honor to fight by your side, Panette."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Panette] 
Your words bring joy to my heart, and I feel 
ever more inspired to crush our enemies!"
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Panette] 
I have found an abundance of insect specimens. 
Here, they're for you to observe and enjoy."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Roy] 
Oh, wow. That is indeed an abundance. Thank 
you, but could you please move them away?"
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
You're an extremely agile fighter, Panette. 
It's extraordinary to see in battle."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Panette] 
Your words honor me. I shall work even harder 
to prove myself worthy of your compliments."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Rosado] 
I have to admit, I hate war. There's nothing 
appealing in it for me at all."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Roy] 
You're right. The appeal is in ending it─securing 
peace for the world and our friends."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
Hehehe, typical Roy. That's true, though. As 
long as we have friends to protect, I'll fight."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Same. Now hold on to that thought. Let it dispel 
any lingering doubts."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Rosado] 
Does a cute ring boost an Emblem's cuteness? 
I might be even more adorable as an Emblem..."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Roy] 
There's never a dull moment with you, Rosado. 
You always have such thought-provoking ideas."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Rosado] 
I love your hair, Roy. It's such a vibrant color! 
Catches the eye."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Does it? Thanks! I don't think anyone's ever 
told me that before. I like your perspective."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Saphir] 
You gave me the power to defend my country 
and my friends, Roy. I'll never forget that."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Roy] 
It's true that I've given you some power, Saphir, 
but don't attribute everything to me."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Roy] 
You've always had the power to fight for your 
friends and country. All I did was lend a hand."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
Hehe, OK, OK, stop it or I'm gonna blush. 
Let's just get back to it."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
You've got an interesting fishing technique, 
Saphir. Most folks use a rod and line."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Saphir] 
Why bother with that nonsense when I can 
snatch them up with my bare hands?"
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Saphir] 
I'm honored to be entrusted with Brodia's 
Emblem Ring. Let's crack some skulls, Roy."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Indeed, Saphir. But let's focus our cracking 
efforts on the skulls that deserve it."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Seadall] 
I was just divining the future and I saw... I saw 
our friends suffering. I don't want that."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Roy] 
No one wants suffering or war. But our friends 
fight so they can, one day, live in peace."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
Then I must make sure that peace happens. 
Roy, will you dance with me on the battlefield?"
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Roy] 
I will. I'll add every ounce of my power to your 
beautiful dance to protect our friends."
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Seadall] 
This sandwich! More sumptuous than what I 
usually eat for my dance. Juicy ham! Dare I?"
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Roy] 
Haha, you're the fortune-teller, Seadall. 
You tell me."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Seadall] 
It was our destiny to fight beside one another, 
Roy. To celebrate, I'd like to show you a dance."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I'm honored, Seadall. I'm told you're a superb 
dancer. At last, I get to see for myself."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
You were brilliant in that last battle, Alcryst! 
Great work covering everyone else's backs."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Alcryst] 
My allies were in danger. I couldn't afford to 
hesitate... It was nothing really."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Roy] 
You call that nothing?! You struck each enemy 
down with a single blow! I call that powerful."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
Such high praise! From the Emblem of Brodia! 
I don't know what to say except...thank you."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Alcryst] 
There must be others who would bond with you 
more effectively, Lord Roy. Am I really worthy?"
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Roy] 
Of course you are, Alcryst. Don't talk that way. 
I really like bonding with you!"
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
I'm glad we can finally team up, Alcryst. 
As Brodia's Emblem, I'll be counting on you!"
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Alcryst] 
You should probably lower your expectations, 
Lord Roy. I'm not reliable like my older brother."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Amber] 
Hey, Roy! I have to ask... You do know what 
an alpaca is, right?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Alpacas? Those are the woolly animals that 
live in your homeland, right?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Amber] 
Yeah! I figured Brodia's Emblem should know 
all about them, like how super fluffy they are!"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Super fluffy, huh? They must be fun to pet too. 
Tell me more."
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
Is something wrong, Amber? You're sweating 
so much... Is it something you ate?"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Amber] 
No, it's not that... I was wearing an alpaca-wool 
sweater my family sent me. Ugh, so hot..."
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Amber] 
I can't believe it... The legendary Roy was 
hiding inside Brodia's ring the whole time!"
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I'm not that big of a deal. But hey, I'm happy 
that you're happy!"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Roy] 
I see you're knitting. Is this how you made the 
lacework you showed me before?"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
Indeed. Knitting beautiful patterns like these 
requires subtle technique and a delicate touch."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Vander] 
More importantly, it calms the heart. There is 
nothing else I would rather do after a battle."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Well then, I'm intrigued. I hope you'll show me 
more of your creations."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Vander] 
I finished a bit of lacework that I thought you 
might find appealing."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Roy] 
It's quite beautiful. I really like it! Perhaps we 
could place it in the Ring Chamber."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Vander] 
Sir Roy, I would most appreciate an opportunity 
to learn more about the Emblems' abilities."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Of course. I'd be glad for the chance to learn 
from you as well, Sir Vander."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Veyle] 
Thank you for fighting beside me, Roy, and for 
sharing your strength with me."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Roy] 
You don't have to thank me, Veyle. I want to 
make sure I live up to your expectations."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
Help me do good things for the people of this 
world. That's all I ask."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Roy] 
I will. I'll be by your side until every dream you 
have for this world comes true."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Veyle] 
Roy, look! I've never seen food this red before. 
I bet it's super spicy and super delicious."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Roy] 
But, Veyle...the look, the smell, the burning! It 
does not look like it belongs in anyone's mouth."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Veyle] 
Roy, I want to do whatever I can to bring peace 
to this world. Will you help me?"
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Roy] 
Of course, Veyle. My strength is yours to wield 
for as long as you need."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Pardon the self-indulgent question, Roy, 
but do you think I'm useful?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Roy] 
Of course I do. It's clear to me how everyone 
relies on your skills, both in and out of battle."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Yunaka] 
You think so? It's all thanks to you! I'm so 
grateful for all you've done for me!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Give yourself some credit, Yunaka. You do great 
work. And you always keep our spirits up."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Mind if I take a closer look at your sword, Roy? 
I'm curious about something."
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Roy] 
Sure, have a look. It's called the Binding Blade."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 

[Roy] 2 
[Yunaka] 
With you at my side, Roy, I feel like I can 
take on anything."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I could say the same to you. I think we'll make 
a fearsome team, Yunaka."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Today, I will be *painting.* Please join me."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Roy] 
That's another one of your interests, right? 
What are you gonna paint?"
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
A portrait of you. Please remain still, that I 
might *preserve* you for future generations."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Roy] 
Uh, thanks. Haha, somehow this is more 
nerve-racking than battle..."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Our training begins now, Roy. It ends only when 
my body *collapses* from exhaustion."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Roy] 
I like your dedication, but there's no need to go 
that far in practice. Taking breaks is important."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 

[Roy] 2 

[Zelkov] 
A bright power seems almost to *radiate* from 
you, Roy. I hope you will lend me this strength."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Roy] 
I'll do all I can for you, Zelkov."
