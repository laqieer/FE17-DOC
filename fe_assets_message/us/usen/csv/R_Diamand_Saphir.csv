[Saphir] 
Prince Diamant. Did you need something 
from me?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Diamant] 
I noticed some hesitation in your last few 
training sessions."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Saphir] 
I know more strength is what I need, but at the 
same time...I'm starting to scare myself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Saphir] 
I'm worried about becoming someone who 
only exists to hurt people."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Diamant] 
Wars leave scars that last forever. They hurt 
everyone involved, on all sides of any conflict."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Diamant] 
I often feel lost, just like you...but I always come 
back to two things. One─I can't run away."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Diamant] 
Two─I don't fight to win. I fight to end the 
fighting. As soldiers, that's all we can do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Saphir] 
I don't know if I have that in me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Diamant] 
I'm so sorry...but we have to. That's the only 
way to change a world driven by conflict."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Saphir] 
I'll...do my best."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Saphir] 
With your help, Prince Diamant...maybe I can 
find a way to do as you ask."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Diamant] 
That's precisely why we train together─to grow 
stronger in our bodies and our bonds."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Diamant] 
After all this talk of fighting...do you feel up to 
another sparring match?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Saphir] 
That's all we can do, isn't it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Diamant] 
That's exactly right."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Saphir] 
OK, but no holding back this time."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Diamant] 
You think I was holding back? I never hold back!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Saphir] 
Whatever you say. In that case, though, you 
better dig deep."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Diamant] 
Haha, now I'm fired up. Bring it on, soldier!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 

[Saphir] 2 
[Diamant] 
Saphir! Any chance I can talk you into that 
sparring match today?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Saphir] 
My stance hasn't changed, Prince Diamant. 
I don't feel ready."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Diamant] 
Even if you don't think you're ready, I'd still 
like to test your current skills."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Saphir] 
If you insist... It'd be rude to turn you away."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Saphir] 
But if I win, will you hear me out on something?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Diamant] 
If you'd rather just chat, we don't need to spar."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Saphir] 
I don't want to discuss this unless I win. 
Wouldn't feel right."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Diamant] 
Interesting. It's a deal, then."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Diamant] 
You actually beat me..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Diamant] 
I knew you were strong, but...I clearly 
underestimated you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Saphir] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Diamant] 
All right. A deal is a deal. What did you want to 
talk about?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Saphir] 
Right... OK."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Saphir] 
When I was a child...Elusia attacked and 
destroyed my home village."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Saphir] 
I survived basically by luck. My parents, my 
friends...they were all killed."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Saphir] 
There was nothing I could do. I was powerless."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Saphir] 
That feeling haunts me to this day. It makes me 
want to scream and tear my heart out."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Diamant] 
I've felt a similar kind of pain myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Saphir] 
That pain is why I train the way I do. Only 
strength can free me from it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Diamant] 
It's royals like me who declare wars...but the 
citizens and soldiers are the ones who suffer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Diamant] 
Your training may keep innocent Brodians safe 
someday. That's the greater meaning behind it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#024,"[Saphir] 
Thank you, Prince Diamant. It does feel good to 
get that off my chest."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#025,"[Saphir] 
I'm going to overcome this weakness, no matter 
what it takes."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Saphir] 2 

[Saphir] 
HYAAA!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Saphir] 
All right─that's 10 of you. Who's next?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Diamant] 1 
[Diamant] 
Very impressive, Saphir."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Saphir] 
Prince Diamant! Didn't realize you 
were watching."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Diamant] 
Checking in on our soldiers is part of my job."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Saphir] 
Don't worry about me─I'm in prime condition, 
built for battle. Ready anytime."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Diamant] 
I've seen enough to know that's not talk. I'm 
sure you can handle just about anything."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Diamant] 
Like, say...a sudden sparring match. Got time 
for a quick round?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Saphir] 
Sir, I...couldn't possibly."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Diamant] 
Oh, sure you could. Don't tell me you're not 
up for it..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Saphir] 
I have a long way to go before I'll feel ready 
to take you on."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Saphir] 
When I'm truly satisfied...it'd be a privilege 
to spar with you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Diamant] 
I see. And when do you think that will be?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Saphir] 
When I finally get past my hatred."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Diamant] 
What do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Saphir] 
The war with Elusia's been too bloody."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Saphir] 
I haven't been able to wipe away the stain on 
my memory."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Saphir] 
I want to put it behind me, but...I need to be 
stronger than I am right now to do it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Diamant] 
I see. Sorry, Saphir. I didn't mean to dredge up 
painful memories like that."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Saphir] 
Not at all. I'm honored by your invitation and 
sorry to decline it."
