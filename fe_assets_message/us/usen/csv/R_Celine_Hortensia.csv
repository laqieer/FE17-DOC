MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Céline] 
You don't seem your usual rambunctious self 
today, Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
OK, Princess Céline. Fine."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Hortensia] 
I admit it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Céline] 
Admit what?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Hortensia] 
You're cuter than me. I admit defeat."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Hortensia] 
I was doomed from the start, really. Who can 
even take their eyes off you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Céline] 
That is high praise indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Céline] 
And yet..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Céline] 
I'm not through poking you. Poke, poke, poke!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Ah! Ahahaha, why?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Céline] 
Shall we call the contest an amicable draw?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Céline] 
You do not lack for cuteness. And you wear 
your mood plainly on your face."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Céline] 
Little do you realize what a comfort those two 
things are to those around you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Hortensia] 
You...really think so?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Céline] 
I do. And never mind my charms. You have 
unique charms all your own."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Céline] 
I daresay a smile suits you better than a pout."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Hortensia] 
When you say things like that, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Aaah, it only makes me like you more!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Céline] 
Good. I was already quite fond of you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Hortensia] 
How can you just stand there being all calm 
and perfect?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Céline] 
Come, Princess Hortensia. Won't you join me 
for a cup of tea?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Céline] 
I've wanted to extend the invitation for some 
time now."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Hortensia] 
Tea? With you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Céline] 
Hahaha, indeed. I think that we two younger 
sisters will have a great deal in common."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Céline] 
As a sign of our friendship, I've imported a 
special blend from Elusia."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Hortensia] 
That's so sweet of you! Yeah, let's go 
right now!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Céline] 
Excellent! Let this tea party, the first of 
many, commence!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Hortensia] 2 

[Céline] 
We meet again, Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Hortensia] 
We do indeed meet, Princess Céline!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Let the competition commence! The first event 
will be...the softness contest!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Hortensia] 
Who will be softer─you or me?! Let's try you 
first. Poke!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Céline] 
Hahaha! That tickles!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Hortensia] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Hortensia] 
The softness contest is hereby canceled."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Céline] 
So soon?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Hortensia] 
Strategic adjustments need to be made."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Céline] 
That's unfortunate. I wanted to have a turn to 
poke at you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Wait, really? Hey, no! Your mind games won't 
distract me─we're competitors!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Céline] 
Heh heh, of course we are."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Hortensia] 
Ugh... What is wrong with me?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Hortensia] 
This girl's so adorable she's messing with my 
mind. Ugh... Insidious!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Céline] 
My turn! Let's see how soft you are! Poke!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Hortensia] 
I told you, that contest is canceled!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Céline] 
Forgive me. I was overcome with curiosity and 
couldn't help myself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Hortensia] 
Why is she smiling like that?! Agh... Why do 
I LIKE it?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Hortensia] 
Enough of your tricks! I'm the cutest there is! 
I'll never be outdone!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Hortensia] 
Aaagh!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Hortensia] 

[Céline] 
There she goes again. Drat! It seems I once 
more missed my chance to invite her to tea."

[Céline] 
Greetings, Princess Hortensia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Hortensia] 
Princess Céline!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Hortensia] 
Hmm...yeah. Yep."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Hortensia] 
You're gonna be tough, but I won't lose."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Céline] 
Pardon, but...what are you talking about?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Hortensia] 
Oh, you're good."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Hortensia] 
We might even be evenly matched, but you 
won't catch me admitting that in competition."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Hortensia] 
I mean, you won't catch me surrendering the 
field of battle!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Céline] 
We are...battling, then?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Hortensia] 
Yes! And I will ignore whatever I need to...to 
proclaim..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Hortensia] 
Princess Céline! You are no match for me!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Hortensia] 
I will defeat you in cuteness! And while I'm at it, 
everything else!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Céline] 
Hmm..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Céline] 
Hahaha! So that's what you were raving about. 
How rambunctious you are."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Hortensia] 
""Rambunctious""?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Hortensia] 
Hmph! Be all calm and superior while you can!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Hortensia] 
I'm gonna fantabulize you into the ground!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Hortensia] 
Might as well get it over with and surrender! 
Bwahahaha!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Hortensia] 

[Céline] 
Is she leaving so soon? I had hoped to invite 
her to tea."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Céline] 
What a darling girl, though. I wish I had a 
younger sister as adorable."
