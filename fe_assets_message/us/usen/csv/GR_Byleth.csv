MID_GR_Alfred_A_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Alfred? You look like you have something 
to say."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#002,"[Alfred] 
I wondered if you also had a tough time building 
muscle. Probably runs in the family, right?"
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#003,"[Byleth] 
Actually, my father was rather burly."
MID_GR_Alfred_A_#004,"[Alfred] 
What?! So one day, you might be too?! Boy, 
do I envy you. If that happens, show me!"
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Alfred] 
Hah! Hrah! Guh-GRAH! Whew! I'm about ready 
to call it a day if you are."
MID_GR_Alfred_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
You seem to never get tired of training. Is there 
no end to your stamina?"
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#001,"[Alfred] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Alfred] 
I did all that training so I could fight for my 
country. But it doesn't feel great that I have to."
MID_GR_Alfred_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
Then let's move swiftly and end the war so 
that we can all put our blades down for good."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Anna] 
Survey time! What products do you most wish 
I would stock?"
MID_GR_Anna_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
I used to love fishing on my days off, so I guess 
I'd like it if you sold rods and bait."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#003,"[Anna] 
Great suggestion! Although it's sad to know 
you don't have a use for them yourself."
MID_GR_Anna_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
I'm not too upset about it. It would make me 
happy just to see people have fun fishing."
MID_GR_Anna_B_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Anna] 
There's got to be something I can do to make 
people buy more stuff. Any ideas, Professor?"
MID_GR_Anna_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
Maybe you could make some of your goods 
limited-time offers. That might entice buyers."
MID_GR_Anna_C_#001,"[Anna] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Anna] 
How goes it, Professor? Anything I can do 
for you?"
MID_GR_Anna_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
Oh, no. I just came to see if you were someone 
I knew once."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Bunet] 
Thanks to you and your recipe, the meal was a 
success, and everyone is satisfied."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Excellent, I'm glad I could help."
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#003,"[Bunet] 
Everyone but me, that is. I must learn more 
dishes from your world. Teach me, Professor!"
MID_GR_Bonet_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Haha, how could I possibly say no? I'll teach 
you as many recipes as you like, Bunet."
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Bunet] 
I've heard you know how to cook, Byleth. Could 
you teach me some recipes from your world?"
MID_GR_Bonet_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
I'd be glad to. But first things first... We must 
find out if the same ingredients exist here."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#001,"[Bunet] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Bunet] 
So, there was a dining hall at the school in your 
world. I'm intrigued to hear about the cuisine."
MID_GR_Bonet_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
I hate to disappoint you, but the fare wasn't 
what you'd call a culinary achievement."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
I see you fish as well, huh? There's something 
I haven't done in too long."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#002,"[Boucheron] 
You're into fishing too?! Perfect! You can come 
out to the lake with me next time."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#003,"[Boucheron] 
Unless it'll be boring for you to just watch."
MID_GR_Boucheron_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Not at all. I'm looking forward to it."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You must be back from your workout if you're 
that sweaty. You always do give it your all."
MID_GR_Boucheron_B_#002,"[Boucheron] 
If only. I've actually been lost all night, 
wandering around trying to find my room."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#001,"[Boucheron] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
There you are, Boucheron. Alfred's been 
calling for you."
MID_GR_Boucheron_C_#002,"[Boucheron] 
Ah, thanks. Um, one moment, though─can you 
direct me to where exactly he is?"
MID_GR_Celine_A_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Céline] 
Would you mind having a look at this, Byleth? 
I intended it as a gift for you."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
A flower? But why?"
MID_GR_Celine_A_#003,"[Céline] 
Since you can't drink your favorite teas, I 
thought that this peony might help soothe you."
MID_GR_Celine_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
That's very thoughtful, Céline. Thank you. 
It's a beautiful flower."
MID_GR_Celine_B_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You seem to be in a good mood. What's 
the occasion?"
MID_GR_Celine_B_#002,"[Céline] 
The bird I've been watching came and landed 
on my shoulder. What an unexpected joy."
MID_GR_Celine_C_#001,"[Céline] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Céline] 
I have heard that you were once a great lover of 
tea. What would you discuss at teatime?"
MID_GR_Celine_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
Let's see... Things we were thankful for, our 
crushes, gripes about everything. The usual."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Chloé] 
Did your world have its own rare folk foods?"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Folk foods? Let me think... I had rocky burdock 
a few times."
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#003,"[Chloé] 
Wow! What a name! It sounds pretty tough, 
though. Was it hard to eat?"
MID_GR_Chloe_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
I admit that it was. But it was good medicine, 
and eating it always filled me with strength."
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Chloé] 
I'm interested in fairy tales from your world. 
Would you mind sharing some with me?"
MID_GR_Chloe_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
I don't know that many, but how about ""Loog 
and the Maiden of Wind""?"
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#001,"[Chloé] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Chloé] 
This must all be a lot to take in. If you have any 
questions, you can always ask me."
MID_GR_Chloe_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
That's very kind of you, Chloé. I'll do my best 
to return the favor however I can."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Everyone just loved your lecture, Professor! 
Would you consider giving another sometime?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Another lecture? I wouldn't mind, but..."
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#003,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, of course! Increased attendance calls for a 
proper school. I'll begin the preparations now!"
MID_GR_Citrinica_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
An entire school just for my lectures? That's a 
bit much...but I trust you'll do it right, Citrinne."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Citrinne] 
I'd love to hear one of your lessons, Professor. 
I think I'll pay for a lecture hall to be built here..."
MID_GR_Citrinica_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
Just for one of my lectures? What's wrong with 
the buildings we already have?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Allies should always work to understand each 
other. What's most important to you, Citrinne?"
MID_GR_Citrinica_C_#002,"[Citrinne] 
I suppose I care about my allies the most! You 
cared just as strongly for your students, right?"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Clanne] 
You never smile or...anything, so it's hard to tell 
how you feel. But it turns out you're really nice!"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
What did I do that gave you that impression?"
MID_GR_Clan_A_#003,"[Clanne] 
You always look out for me, say hello, and treat 
me like we're equals. It makes me happy."
MID_GR_Clan_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
I am pleased you feel that way, and I hope we 
can continue working together."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Clanne, would you mind telling me about 
yourself? I know next to nothing."
MID_GR_Clan_B_#002,"[Clanne] 
I know more about the Divine Dragon, but OK. 
What do you want to hear?"
MID_GR_Clan_C_#001,"[Clanne] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Clanne, do you need anything? I've felt you 
staring at me for some time..."
MID_GR_Clan_C_#002,"[Clanne] 
Nope. I'm just admiring you, Professor. 
Wait! Professor?! You noticed me?!"
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Diamant] 
War is built on hatred. That hatred bears new 
tragedies of its own. There is no reason for it..."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
I'm surprised to hear you speak like this. I had 
assumed you were always hungry for battle."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
I do think a strong military is important, but 
only if it serves the common citizens."
MID_GR_Diamand_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
I agree. Wars offer little to gain and much to 
lose. You'll make an excellent king, Diamant."
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Diamant] 
Tell me, Professor... Do you have any proven 
methods for instilling confidence in someone?"
MID_GR_Diamand_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
Earnest praise delivered often. When they do 
something well, make sure they know it."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Diamant] 
You were a mercenary before you began to 
teach, right? You seem accustomed to battle."
MID_GR_Diamand_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
Do I? I guess I'm not very aware of how I come 
across on the battlefield."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Are you having dinner...again? But didn't 
everyone just eat together?"
MID_GR_Etie_A_#002,"[Etie] 
You have to eat right along with your exercise 
or you'll lose muscle mass."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#003,"[Etie] 
If anything happened to my abs after I spent so 
long on them, I'd probably cry."
MID_GR_Etie_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
That makes sense. It's very thorough of you."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
I've said it before, but your and Alfred's mania 
for training reminds me of my students."
MID_GR_Etie_B_#002,"[Etie] 
They got to spar with you, I bet. Talk about 
a prime teaching opportunity!"
MID_GR_Etie_C_#001,"[Etie] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Etie] 
Sorry, can we chat later? I've really gotta focus 
on my muscle training right now."
MID_GR_Etie_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
Didn't I see you doing that earlier today? Your 
zeal reminds me of my students."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Fogado] 
I think I finally get you, Byleth. You're a 
free-spirited sort, is all."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
This may be the first time I've ever been called 
that. What makes you say so?"
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#003,"[Fogado] 
You're not beholden to others, and you treat 
everyone as equals. I like that about you."
MID_GR_Fogato_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Ah, I think I understand. As it happens, I like 
those very same things about you, Fogado."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Fogado] 
Tell me more about yourself, Byleth. I want to 
get to know you─the real you."
MID_GR_Fogato_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
I thought we were close already. But tell me 
what you'd like to know. I have nothing to hide."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#001,"[Fogado] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Fogado] 
You're a hard one to pin down aren't you, 
Byleth. A bit of a mystery, you might say."
MID_GR_Fogato_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
So I've been told. Though I can't say that I find 
myself to be anything but quite normal."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Framme] 
You're so nice, Professor. I bet your students 
loved having a teacher like you."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
I enjoyed being a teacher. But it's fair to say my 
students taught me many things as well."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#003,"[Byleth] 
Just like you, Framme. You've taught me a lot 
and for that, I'm very grateful."
MID_GR_Fram_A_#004,"[Framme] 
Aww, you're making me blush. I feel like 
I should be the one thanking you."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Framme] 
Aw, Professor, I did it again! I was trying to help 
out, I swear, but I messed everything up."
MID_GR_Fram_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
It's all right. Turn your failures into learning 
experiences and they won't be failures at all."
MID_GR_Fram_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Framme] 
Professor! I'm so excited you're here and on 
our side. I've been dying to shake your hand!"
MID_GR_Fram_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
I would very much like to, but a friendly wave 
will have to do."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Goldmary] 
My village is famous for its hot springs."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
That sounds great. We had a sauna back at the 
academy. We used to relax in it after training."
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#003,"[Goldmary] 
Sharing a sauna with your students? Were you 
not worried about being too familiar with them?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Oh, no─I was pretty informal with my students, 
but I always kept a respectful distance too."
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
That was quite a dramatic sigh. What's wrong?"
MID_GR_Goldmary_B_#002,"[Goldmary] 
Merely lamenting that my talent is impossible 
for most to fathom. The curse of greatness."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#001,"[Goldmary] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Goldmary] 
You haven't complimented me once today, 
Byleth. There's no need to hold back, you know."
MID_GR_Goldmary_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
I'll keep that in mind. Thanks?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Hortensia] 
You know, Professor, you're nothing like any 
teacher I've ever had."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
I used to get that all the time. Probably because 
I started teaching at such a young age."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#003,"[Hortensia] 
That's not what I mean. I think it's because 
we're close friends. I feel...seen. Listened to."
MID_GR_Hortensia_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Good, because you are. I'm happy to listen 
to you anytime you like, Hortensia."
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Hortensia] 
I hate that I fought against everyone here. But 
the worst thought is...what if I had won?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
There's no use worrying about what could have 
been. It's in the past now. Look to the future."
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#001,"[Hortensia] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Hortensia] 
I don't get it, Professor. I abused your power. 
How can you pretend like that never happened?"
MID_GR_Hortensia_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
I'm not pretending. I just don't see any reason 
to chastise someone who already feels remorse."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Ivy] 
You've lost your father as well, have you not?"
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Yes...and it wasn't until after he was gone that 
I realized how irreplaceable he was to me."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#003,"[Byleth] 
But that realization made me appreciate others 
in my life─to cherish them while I have them."
MID_GR_Ivy_A_#004,"[Ivy] 
I respect that. I only hope I can muster the same 
strength to overcome and move on."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Ivy] 
However much thought I give my father now, 
no good can possibly come of it."
MID_GR_Ivy_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
I disagree. It can help you come to terms with 
the loss. And you will always have his memory."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#001,"[Ivy] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Has something happened, Ivy? You seem a little 
out of sorts."
MID_GR_Ivy_C_#002,"[Ivy] 
I was thinking of my father, that's all."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Jade] 
By the way, I write novels. I know it's an odd 
hobby for someone like me."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
I don't think it's odd at all. I know there's a 
complex person under all that armor."
MID_GR_Jade_A_#003,"[Byleth] 
But I am curious to know what kinds of stories 
you write. May I read some of them?"
MID_GR_Jade_A_#004,"[Jade] 
Of course, Professor. Heh, I saw you smile. 
We'll see if I can get a full laugh out of you next."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Are you OK, Jade? You look a bit weary. Let me 
know if you need to rest for a while."
MID_GR_Jade_B_#002,"[Jade] 
Thanks, but I'm fine. Just worked a bit late last 
night. Surprised you could read that on my face."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#001,"[Jade] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Jade] 
I'm not one to talk, but I've noticed that you 
often wear the same expression─even in battle."
MID_GR_Jade_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
I've been told people have a hard time reading 
my emotions. I'm not sure how I feel about that."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Jean] 
What do you think, Professor? Am I a good 
enough fighter yet?"
MID_GR_Jean_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
It's good that you want to do your part, but you 
should look after yourself first."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#003,"[Jean] 
I know that. I really do...but I see all that's 
happening, and I can't help myself."
MID_GR_Jean_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
You know... Follow your instincts, Jean. 
I'll watch out for you."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Jean] 
Professor, could you teach me how to fight? 
I'd like to be more useful, even if just a little bit."
MID_GR_Jean_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
If that's what you want, then sure, I'll give you 
lessons. We'll start with self-defense."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#001,"[Jean] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You seem to be in a good mood, Jean."
MID_GR_Jean_C_#002,"[Jean] 
Yeah! A soldier I'd been treating for some time 
finally recovered. I was so worried about him."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
I will tell you my secret. As one with whom I 
share such close bonds, you deserve to know."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
You're being unexpectedly serious. What is it?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
I have inherited powers of foresight from my 
mother. I can tell you exactly what is for dinner!"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
I guess I can see how that would be useful, 
but doesn't it ruin the surprise?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
I am happy to say that our bond of friendship 
has become intensely strong, Byleth."
MID_GR_Kagetsu_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
I'm glad we're friends, but that's a rather 
intense choice of words, don't you think?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#001,"[Kagetsu] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Byleth! Why did you abandon mercenary life 
for teaching? Did you not enjoy your freedom?"
MID_GR_Kagetsu_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
Of course. But I wouldn't have met my students 
if I'd remained a mercenary. I have no regrets."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Lapis] 
Thanks for always lending an ear, Professor. 
I guess those rumors about you are true."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Rumors? What rumors?"
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#003,"[Lapis] 
That you're a really good listener! Talking to 
you always makes people feel better."
MID_GR_Lapis_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
It does? Really? That would explain why people 
keep confiding in me..."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Lapis] 
In Brodia, if you've got what it takes, even a 
country bumpkin can end up as a royal retainer."
MID_GR_Lapis_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
So many people feel burdened by their origins. 
It's good that Brodia offers equal opportunities."
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#001,"[Lapis] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You eat your meals with such enthusiasm, 
Lapis. Tell me, do you have a favorite food?"
MID_GR_Lapis_C_#002,"[Lapis] 
Let's see... I've always been a big fan of taters. 
They're nutritious and filling."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
We get more reluctant to try things as we grow 
older. That's what impresses me about you."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#002,"[Lindon] 
Well, one never knows until one tries."
MID_GR_Linden_A_#003,"[Byleth] 
You're not scared that you might fail?"
MID_GR_Linden_A_#004,"[Lindon] 
Haha! What is failure, really? Discovering which 
methods don't work is a success in itself."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Lindon] 
Indulge me, Professor... I'm researching novel 
uses for magic, but I've been coming up short."
MID_GR_Linden_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
How about magic to create blessed jelly? 
Let me see if I can remember the recipe..."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#001,"[Lindon] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Lindon] 
I'm a scholar but not a professor. You have 
more experience in matters of mentorship."
MID_GR_Linden_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
I think you could be a good professor. I started 
as a mercenary, and I managed it somehow."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Louis] 
I saw you watching our chef with no small 
fascination. Are you a cook yourself?"
MID_GR_Louis_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Yes. I used to like cooking quite a bit."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#003,"[Louis] 
Hmm. A professor who cooks, eh? Now that's 
an intriguing prospect."
MID_GR_Louis_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Are you OK, Louis? Did we lose you?"
MID_GR_Louis_B_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
What's this? A sachet of black tea? It smells 
nice."
MID_GR_Louis_B_#002,"[Louis] 
I had it specifically made for you. You can at 
least enjoy the scent, if not the taste."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#001,"[Louis] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Sorry for making you wait on me, Louis, but 
you are pretty helpful."
MID_GR_Louis_C_#002,"[Louis] 
There's no need to apologize. Waiting on people 
is what I do best."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Alear] 
Before you were a professor, you were a... 
mercenary? What do mercenaries do?"
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
They're fighting forces for hire. We went to war 
for nations without belonging to them."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#003,"[Byleth] 
So our allies in one battle might be our enemies 
in the next."
MID_GR_Lueur_A_#004,"[Alear] 
Though with enough motive, that could happen 
anyway... Thanks for the lesson, Professor."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Alear] 
Oh, Professor! Sorry, I know I'm not one of 
your students. I just wanted to see how it felt."
MID_GR_Lueur_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
I don't mind. It's what most everyone called 
me, after all."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#001,"[Alear] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
The fighting won't let up anytime soon. If it gets 
too much for you, you can lean on me."
MID_GR_Lueur_C_#002,"[Alear] 
Thank you. I should count myself lucky to have 
so many friends looking out for me."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Lady Veyle told me to ""get a hobby."""
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
That's a good idea. Having a hobby helps 
you relax."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#003,"[Mauvier] 
With no room in life for pleasures until now, it 
is a difficult task to choose one for myself."
MID_GR_Mauve_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Perhaps Veyle could help you in your search. 
She will enjoy it too."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Mauvier] 
Professor. How do you relax? I force myself to 
sit for nearly two minutes, but it does not help."
MID_GR_Mauve_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
You can't force yourself to relax. But know that 
your friends worry if you overwork yourself."
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#001,"[Mauvier] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You want to speak about Veyle? OK. But why 
with me?"
MID_GR_Mauve_C_#002,"[Mauvier] 
The word is that you are a good listener. 
Especially when someone is troubled."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You seem to be enjoying that book, Merrin. 
What is it about?"
MID_GR_Merin_A_#002,"[Merrin] 
It's an encyclopedia of rare critters. I absolutely 
adore learning about them."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#003,"[Byleth] 
You know, I once pulled a legendary fish called 
the goddess messenger from a shimmering lake."
MID_GR_Merin_A_#004,"[Merrin] 
Legendary fish?! Goddess messenger?! That 
sounds amazing! I must hear the whole story!"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Merrin] 
I want to be a great knight. You taught at the 
Officers Academy─tell me, what's your advice?"
MID_GR_Merin_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
What I can tell you is this... All the knights I've 
known were steadfast to their very core."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#001,"[Merrin] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Merrin] 
Your moves are very cool, Professor. Of course, 
my moves are nothing to scoff at either."
MID_GR_Merin_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
Ah, is that so? I'll be sure to take a closer look 
next time I have a chance."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Timerra] 
If you could do anything, what would it be? 
And don't say, ""fight for peace."" Be creative."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Hmm, I've never really thought about it."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#003,"[Byleth] 
But now that I am... I think I'd very much enjoy 
traveling about with you, Timerra."
MID_GR_Misutira_A_#004,"[Timerra] 
Aw, Byleth. What a sweet thing to say! I'd love 
to take you to see all my favorite places."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Timerra] 
Choir was a thing at your school, right? Because 
I've got this new song I'd love to run by you."
MID_GR_Misutira_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
Oh, uh, I am far from an expert on music, 
I assure you."
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#001,"[Timerra] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Timerra] 
I made up a song for you, Byleth. Here goes... 
♪Byleth is the best! I'm so happy we met!♪"
MID_GR_Misutira_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
That is a very...distinctive...melody."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Pandreo] 
Folks turn to the church when they're troubled. 
But sometimes, I don't know how to help them."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Hmm, I see. Pandreo, sometimes just listening 
to a person is the help they truly need."
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#003,"[Pandreo] 
That's really wise, Professor. Would it be OK 
if I talked to you about my troubles sometimes?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Of course. Talk to me anytime. And I hope I 
can turn to you for advice as well, Pandreo."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Pandreo] 
I love to dance, but when I do, my friends call 
it the Dance of Darkness and...not in a nice way."
MID_GR_Pandoro_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
Ah, well, I do have some dance experience. I'd 
be happy to give you some lessons if you'd like."
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#001,"[Pandreo] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Pandreo] 
You once lived in a monastery, right? What 
would you say to having a prayer together?"
MID_GR_Pandoro_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
I'm unfamiliar with the manner in which you 
worship here, but I'm willing to give it a try."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Panette] 
Tell me, Byleth, how do you know a true lady 
when you see one?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Well, I believe that a ""lady"" is someone who 
glows from within."
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#003,"[Panette] 
What a curious thing to say. How would one go 
about ""glowing from within"" do you think?"
MID_GR_Panetone_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Inner beauty always finds its way to the surface. 
I dare say, Panette, you are a perfect example."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Panette] 
Now then, Byleth. Today we will once more set 
about eradicating those vile bandits."
MID_GR_Panetone_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
Happy to help, Panette. I find your enthusiasm 
for the work quite infectious."
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#001,"[Panette] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
I found a wooden sword. Is it yours, Panette?"
MID_GR_Panetone_C_#002,"[Panette] 
I think not! Someone as dignified as myself 
would never wield such a crude weapon."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
That's quite a bit of shopping you've done. 
Did you buy everything they had?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#002,"[Rosado] 
Nearly. There were too many cute outfits and 
accessories. I can't be expected to resist."
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#003,"[Rosado] 
If I hadn't bought them all now, I would've had 
to go back for them later. Why take two trips?"
MID_GR_Rosado_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Of course. Very efficient."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Are you OK, Rosado? You're staring at me."
MID_GR_Rosado_B_#002,"[Rosado] 
I've been waiting for your expression to change. 
Even once. You're incredibly stoic, you know!"
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#001,"[Rosado] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Rosado] 
I wish you'd taught at the academy in Elusia. 
Class with you would be fun, Professor."
MID_GR_Rosado_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
I mostly told a lot of stories. No reason I can't 
tell those to you here, if you're interested."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Saphir] 
Royal knight was the dream, but after the war, 
I'll need to find a new way to grow my strength."
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
You'd throw away your dream like that? Why?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#003,"[Saphir] 
If I stick around for peacetime, I'll get rusty. 
Won't be any good to my king then, will I?"
MID_GR_Saphir_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Always looking one step ahead. You're a warrior 
through and through, Saphir. I respect that."
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Saphir] 
Going from mercenary to professor must've 
been tough. Ever worry about getting too soft?"
MID_GR_Saphir_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
Actually, having students look up to you is quite 
motivating. Made me train even harder."
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#001,"[Saphir] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Saphir] 
So, we've got a good haul of fish to work with. 
Should we grill? Fry? Stew? What do you think?"
MID_GR_Saphir_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
How about we make super-spicy fish dango? 
My students loved it. Could be to your liking."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Seadall] 
You're in excellent shape, Byleth. You'd look 
good dressed in dancing attire like mine."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
As it happens, I've taught classes in a similar 
outfit."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#003,"[Seadall] 
Really? That's fantastic. What did the students 
think? They must have been very impressed."
MID_GR_Seadas_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Yes, the reaction was quite positive. Or at 
least...I thought so?"
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Seadall] 
Why among all that I eat...must savory food 
hold such sway? It throws off my dance steps!"
MID_GR_Seadas_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
I think the solution lies in being swayed, and 
working that into those dance steps of yours."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#001,"[Seadall] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Seadall, what are you doing here? The war 
council is about to begin."
MID_GR_Seadas_C_#002,"[Seadall] 
The stars insist my destiny is to remain on this 
spot all day. I'll catch up on council news later."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Alcryst] 
When I pass on, I'll be an obscure footnote in 
history with no accomplishments to my name..."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Many people do pass on without making their 
mark, but I doubt that will be your case."
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#003,"[Alcryst] 
You really think I'll achieve something? My skills 
are so lacking... What good could I possibly do?"
MID_GR_Staluke_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
My students taught me that everyone finds their 
own path. I know you'll find yours too, Alcryst."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You seem worried about something, Alcryst. 
If you'd like to talk about it, I'm here to listen."
MID_GR_Staluke_B_#002,"[Alcryst] 
I'm writing a letter of self-introduction...but I'm 
running out of ways to say ""worthless burden."""
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#001,"[Alcryst] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You handled that last battle well, Alcryst."
MID_GR_Staluke_C_#002,"[Alcryst] 
Are you saying that I'm not challenging myself 
enough? I'll work much harder next time."
MID_GR_Umber_A_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Amber] 
Your sword is so cool, Professor. It turns into a 
whip, right? Can I see how it works?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
I don't see why not. Stand back. Hyah! How 
was that?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#003,"[Amber] 
Whoa! I take it back. That sword isn't cool─it's 
SUPER cool! Can you make it do a loop?"
MID_GR_Umber_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Hya! That was a pretty good loop. I think I'm 
enjoying this! Any more requests?"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Amber] 
You were a professor at the Officers Academy, 
right? Can you teach me how to win any battle?"
MID_GR_Umber_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
That's hard to summarize, but...it requires both 
heightened skill and broadened collaboration."
MID_GR_Umber_C_#001,"[Amber] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Hello, Amber. I heard you coming. You're an 
easy man to track."
MID_GR_Umber_C_#002,"[Amber] 
Aw, thanks! It's great to know that I stand out 
in a crowd...even when I'm not doing anything."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You work too hard, Vander. Can't you delegate 
some of your duties?"
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#002,"[Vander] 
I've performed my day's work since I was a lad. 
It's not at all a burden worth delegating."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#003,"[Vander] 
Still, I do appreciate your concern, nevertheless."
MID_GR_Vandre_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
I see. Well, please don't overextend yourself. We 
need you on the battlefield, not in the infirmary."
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
Vander, can I help you with anything?"
MID_GR_Vandre_B_#002,"[Vander] 
Nay, leave the random chores to this old man. 
You have young soldiers to teach, Professor."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#001,"[Vander] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You always seem so busy, Vander."
MID_GR_Vandre_C_#002,"[Vander] 
There is much to do. And I find it easiest on the 
mind to dispense with all my tasks at once."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Veyle] 
I love spicy food. Did you have any especially 
spicy dishes in your world, Professor?"
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Oh yes. Super-spicy fish dango was a dish 
known for scorching your entire mouth."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#003,"[Veyle] 
That sounds super yummy! I hope you'll teach 
me how to make it sometime."
MID_GR_Veyre_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
I'd be glad to. It will take all our fortitude, but 
we shall face this fiery feast together."
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Byleth] 
You look like you're keeping very busy, Veyle. 
What are you doing?"
MID_GR_Veyre_B_#002,"[Veyle] 
I want to make myself as useful as I can, so I've 
been doing little errands for everyone."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#001,"[Veyle] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Veyle] 
Now that I'm here with everyone, I just feel so 
happy. Though, I probably shouldn't let myself."
MID_GR_Veyre_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
You should let yourself. You're our ally now, 
Veyle. You have every right to your happiness."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Yunaka] 
This academy of yours sounds pretty neat. 
What'd you teach your students?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
Most of the lessons at the Officers Academy 
centered around strategy and martial skills."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#003,"[Byleth] 
It wasn't all about classes, though. There were 
lots of other activities─choir, fishing, cooking..."
MID_GR_Yunaka_A_#004,"[Yunaka] 
That sounds amazing! I'd love a school like that. 
Sign me up! How do I apply?"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Yunaka] 
So you went from mercenary to professor? 
That's a huge career change!"
MID_GR_Yunaka_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
It's not the most dramatic leap I've seen. 
A colleague of mine was once a songstress."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#001,"[Yunaka] 1 
[Byleth] 2 
[Yunaka] 
Geez, you're mysterious, Professor. Not even 
my sharp eyes can get a read on you."
MID_GR_Yunaka_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
My father used to say the same."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Zelkov] 
You are a popular teacher. I *presume* you 
are skilled at communicating with children."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#002,"[Byleth] 
I never thought much about being popular with 
my students. I just tried to understand them."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#003,"[Zelkov] 
*Understand* them. Yes, of course. Such a 
simple idea. I will keep it in mind. Thank you."
MID_GR_Zelkova_A_#004,"[Byleth] 
Remember that even teachers, for all their 
good intentions, can be intimidating."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Battle provides an intense feeling of *purpose.* 
When it is over, I often feel lost."
MID_GR_Zelkova_B_#002,"[Byleth] 
It's OK to wander aimlessly sometimes. You 
never know what opportunities might find you."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#001,"[Zelkov] 1 
[Byleth] 2 

[Zelkov] 
Odd of you to want to speak to me, Professor. 
I'm afraid I am *preoccupied* at the moment."
MID_GR_Zelkova_C_#002,"[Byleth] 
Of course. I'm sorry to disturb you."
