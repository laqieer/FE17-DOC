..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Framme] 
Hey, Kagetsu. Why the long face?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Kagetsu] 
Hello, Framme. Ah, you mean to say that 
I appear sad."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Framme] 
Still no response to your letter?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
None indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
It appears my family really has given up on me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Framme] 
No! There was probably just some issue getting 
the letter delivered."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps there was. Perhaps it is for the best."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
I do not know that I would be courageous 
enough to read their reply if I received one."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Framme] 
Hey, what happened to the guy who stared 
down a blank page and defeated it?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Framme] 
And there could still be a response on the way. 
It's too soon to give up. Have some faith!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
Faith, you say..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Framme] 
Just wait a bit longer, OK? And then we'll 
write a response together!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
You are right. I have been impatient."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Kagetsu] 
While we wait, perhaps you would show me 
what your parents wrote to you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Framme] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
That letter there in your hand. Is that not what 
your parents sent to you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
I am curious to see what your family has to say. 
Only if it is OK with you, of course."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Framme] 
Oh, uh, sure. It's probably just the usual 
stuff, anyway."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Framme] 
Let me just see what it's about first... Hmm... 
Mm-hmm... Ah!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
What has surprised you? Hmm, let me see..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
We heard from Vander... Stop goofing around... 
Train harder..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Kagetsu] 
They are scolding you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Framme] 
AHH! Don't look at this one anymore!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Kagetsu] 
Hm. It appears I need to help you with 
your training."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Framme] 
No, you don't!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Kagetsu] 
You helped me write my letter. I owe this 
to you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Kagetsu] 
It is simple reciprocity between friends."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Framme] 
I liked this better when it was about your 
problems..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Hmm, no... This is not right..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Kagetsu] 
Perhaps if I..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Framme] 1 
[Framme] 
Hellooo, Kagetsuuu!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Kagetsu] 
Ah!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
Framme! You...startled me."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Framme] 
Did you just hide something real quick? What 
were you doing in here?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Kagetsu] 
No. Absolutely not. I have never hidden things."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Framme] 
Wow, are you a terrible liar! If you're not hiding 
anything, you won't mind if I look around..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
No! Framme, do not look!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Framme] 
Hm? What's this paper?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Framme] 
Oh! Wait─is this a letter?!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
Yes."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Framme] 
Ah, I'm sorry! Here, take it back. I didn't read 
any of it!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
It is OK. I had not truly started, so there is 
almost nothing to read."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Framme] 
You're writing a letter after all? You were 
so against it before."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Kagetsu] 
I felt...compelled to take up pen and paper."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Kagetsu] 
Only now that I have, I do not know how 
to begin. I do not know what to write."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Framme] 
Oh, don't be silly!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Framme] 
Just tell them what's happened to you lately. 
They want to know you're still alive."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Framme] 
I'll help you out, if you want. Just write to 
them, OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
Framme...you are most kind."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Kagetsu] 
To concern yourself with me and my family 
in this way is exemplary. Thank you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Kagetsu] 
With your support, I will face this blank page 
and roundly defeat it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Framme] 1 
[Framme] 
""I am doing fine. How is everything at home?"""
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Kagetsu] 2 
[Kagetsu] 
Hello, Framme. Writing to someone, are you?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Framme] 
My parents. If I don't send them updates now 
and then, they get all worried."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Framme] 
Can you believe it? At my age? Are all parents 
like this?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Kagetsu] 
They are not. Your parents must cherish you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Kagetsu] 
We feel concern for ones we love. So it is good 
your family feels concern for you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Framme] 
Well...maybe a little."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Framme] 
You're from really far away, right? Letters from 
your family must be important to you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Kagetsu] 
I would not say so. I have not received any."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Framme] 
Huh? Why not?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Kagetsu] 
They cannot write to me because I fled my 
home and did not say where I was going."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Kagetsu] 
But I think they would be too angry to write me 
letters even if they knew where to send them."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Framme] 
So, you haven't been home even once since you 
ran away?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Kagetsu] 
I have not."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Framme] 
That's awful! If I were your family, I'd be super 
worried about you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Framme] 
Hey, I've got ink and paper here. You should 
write a letter to your family right now!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Framme] 
I'm sure they'd be thrilled to hear from you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Kagetsu] 
Write to my family? No, no, absolutely not."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Framme] 
Aww... But it was such a good idea!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Kagetsu] 
It is kind of you to worry, but this is my burden 
to bear."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#021,"[Kagetsu] 
I do appreciate your offer to help. Thank you, 
little friend!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#022,"[Framme] 
""Little""?!"
