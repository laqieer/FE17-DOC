[Citrinne] 2 

[Alcryst] 
Citrinne, do you have a moment?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Citrinne] 
Oh, Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Alcryst] 
I'm not sure if it's because we're cousins or 
what, but...we have a lot in common."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Alcryst] 
As you know, I find it...difficult...to accept my 
own worth. I see that same struggle in you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Citrinne] 
How do you mean?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Alcryst] 
You believe that you're too weak to be my 
retainer, but you couldn't be more wrong."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Citrinne] 
Alcryst, you really don't have to try and make 
me feel better about this."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Citrinne] 
In terms of strength, I am inferior to the other 
royal retainers. That is irrefutable."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Alcryst] 
If you're referring to raw power, maybe."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Alcryst] 
But that's why you use every spare moment 
you have to train, right?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Alcryst] 
Rain or shine, you haven't missed a single day."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Alcryst] 
You may lack physical strength, but you make 
up for it in strength of will. That matters."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Citrinne] 
Perhaps, but...commitment to training is not 
what makes a worthy retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Alcryst] 
Again, I disagree."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Alcryst] 
Because I know how seriously you take your 
role, it's easy to place my trust in you. So I do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Citrinne] 
You do? Really?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Alcryst] 
Do you have any idea how reassured I was 
when I heard that you would be my retainer?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Alcryst] 
Wait─reassured isn't the right word for it. 
Let me phrase this more clearly."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Alcryst] 
I am so, so glad that you became my retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Alcryst] 
Yes, we are cousins. Yes, we have known each 
other since we were very young."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Alcryst] 
But I don't care about the obvious reasons why 
you were chosen."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Alcryst] 
To me, the important difference is that you 
volunteered for this position yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Citrinne] 
I wanted to protect my wonderful cousin."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Alcryst] 
Exactly. I don't deserve that protection, but... 
it means the world to me that you think I do."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Alcryst] 
That's why I'm happy things are like 
this, Citrinne."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Citrinne] 
Alcryst..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Citrinne] 
That's...such a wonderful thing to hear you say. 
It makes me want to redouble my training!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Citrinne] 
I have a long way to go before I know I can 
protect you, after all."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Alcryst] 
Hey, wait─I'm the one who's protecting you!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Citrinne] 
Haha, of course. Thank you, Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Citrinne] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Oh, it's hopeless. My best is still so weak."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Citrinne] 
I... I don't deserve to be Alcryst's retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Alcryst] 
I disagree."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Alcryst! Again? How long have you been there?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Alcryst] 
A while. I apologize for spying. I was worried 
about you after our last chat."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Alcryst] 
Do you really believe that you don't deserve to 
be my retainer? You know that's not true."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Citrinne] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Citrinne] 
Alcryst, you and I are cousins─practically 
siblings since we grew up together."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Citrinne] 
And, for as long as I've known you, you've 
carried a low opinion of yourself."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Citrinne] 
Growing up in Diamant's shadow didn't give 
you many chances to shine on your own."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Alcryst] 
That's true. I suppose it's still true."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Citrinne] 
But I've seen you shine. I see how amazing you 
truly are."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Citrinne] 
You always spot a person's greatest skill or best 
quality and make sure they're recognized for it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Citrinne] 
You support and openly praise the people 
around you."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Citrinne] 
I could go on."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Alcryst] 
You're giving me far too much credit..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Citrinne] 
A person like that should be protected. I've felt 
that way about you since we were children."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Citrinne] 
But I was a fool to think I could succeed at that. 
Convictions aren't enough."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Citrinne] 
I am simply not strong enough to keep you safe."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Alcryst] 
That isn't true!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#021,"[Citrinne] 
I'm sorry, Alcryst. I'm so sorry that they chose 
me to be your retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#022,"[Citrinne] 
If you weren't stuck with me...I'm sure you'd 
have someone stronger by your side."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#023,"[Alcryst] 
Citrinne..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Citrinne] 2 

[Citrinne] 
Hyah!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Citrinne] 
I just can't seem to get this right."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Alcryst] 1 

[Alcryst] 
Hello, Citrinne. Are you training with magic?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Citrinne] 
Oh! Alcryst! Where did you come from? 
Are you lost?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Alcryst] 
What? No, I was just passing by."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Citrinne] 
I see. My goodness, you were so...quiet."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Alcryst] 
You always seem to be training in your spare 
time, Citrinne. I admire your dedication."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Alcryst] 
I think you might be the hardest-working person 
in all of Brodia."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Citrinne] 
I appreciate the kind words, Alcryst, but..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Citrinne] 
All of this training isn't enough. I'm still far 
behind everyone else."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Citrinne] 
I must, must, must grow stronger."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Alcryst] 
Really? Why? I think you're fine as you are now. 
Besides, I'll protect you."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Citrinne] 
Ah, yes. That's the same Alcryst I knew as a 
child─placing others well ahead of himself."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Citrinne] 
However...I can't rely on your kindness."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Citrinne] 
When it comes down to it, I..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Alcryst] 
Citrinne?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Citrinne] 
No, it's nothing. Don't worry about it."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Citrinne] 
I need to resume my training. Please excuse 
me, Alcryst."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Alcryst] 
Oh, uh... All right, Citrinne..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Citrinne] 

[Alcryst] 
Something is seriously bothering her...but what?"
