[Diamant] 
Amber, please don't leave me in suspense any 
longer. I need to know what you meant before."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#002,"[Amber] 
You mean about the ""deepest, truest"" reason 
why I think you're the greatest?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#003,"[Diamant] 
Indeed."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#004,"[Amber] 
I think I've got it. I was gonna say, ""You're the 
greatest...because you're like a human alpaca!"""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#005,"[Diamant] 
What? An alpaca?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#006,"[Amber] 
Yeah! I've felt that about you since day one, 
so that has to be it."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#007,"[Diamant] 
Since day one?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#008,"[Amber] 
It was the day of the tournament, remember? 
My family didn't want me to enter, but I did."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#009,"[Amber] 
I lost to Jade...but got second place! Folks back 
home called it the ""alpaca-country miracle."""
MID_RELIANCE_A_#010,"[Diamant] 
I don't remember you being quite as thrilled at 
the time. Didn't you leave the arena weeping?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#011,"[Amber] 
Yeah... I wanted to be the champion so bad."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#012,"[Amber] 
I was sobbing in a corner when you walked over 
and asked me to be your second retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#013,"[Amber] 
You were smiling down at me so gently... 
That was when it hit me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#014,"[Amber] 
This man...has the soul of an alpaca."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#015,"[Diamant] 
THAT was what hit you?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#016,"[Amber] 
I decided, right then and there, to stand beside 
you and protect you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#017,"[Diamant] 
..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#018,"[Amber] 
What's up? Why the funny face?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#019,"[Diamant] 
I'm just...not sure which parts of me make you 
think of an alpaca."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#020,"[Amber] 
Oh. Well, it's a few things. How can I explain..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#021,"[Amber] 
You're kind, you put me at ease, and I want to 
protect you. And you're all light and fluffy!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#022,"[Diamant] 
Did you just call me...light and fluffy?"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#023,"[Amber] 
I know. High praise. Not everyone understands 
how strongly I admire alpacas."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#024,"[Diamant] 
So, it's a compliment..."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#025,"[Amber] 
Totally."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#026,"[Diamant] 
Huh. OK... I'll track down another secret potion. 
Then I'll know if you're being honest with me."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#027,"[Amber] 
Huh?!"
MID_RELIANCE_A_#028,"[Diamant] 
Haha! I'm joking. If you say you feel that 
strongly, I believe you."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#029,"[Diamant] 
It's an honor to be held in alpaca-level regard. 
I'm glad you're my retainer, Amber."
MID_RELIANCE_A_#030,"[Amber] 
Thanks, Prince Diamant. It's an honor to stand 
with you. That's the truth─no potion required!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Amber] 2 
[Diamant] 
Hey, Amber. I'm ready to talk about that secret 
potion incident."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#002,"[Amber] 
Oh, right! I can't wait to hear what I said."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#003,"[Diamant] 
So, you said you're grateful to me and you 
respect me─an extreme amount, apparently."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#004,"[Amber] 
Haha, is that all? Aw, you knew that 
stuff already!"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#005,"[Diamant] 
True. You're not shy about that. You've gone 
out of your way to save me many times."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#006,"[Diamant] 
But there was something else you said..."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#007,"[Diamant] 
Something about how, if it weren't for me, you 
would probably be on an alpaca ranch?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#008,"[Amber] 
Yeah, that checks out. My family owns an 
alpaca ranch back home."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#009,"[Amber] 
That's all my hometown has─alpacas and cliffs. 
To become a big hero, I knew I'd have to leave."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#010,"[Amber] 
You opened a path for me to become that hero 
as your retainer. That's why I'm so grateful."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#011,"[Diamant] 
I see. Well, it's a shame that secret potion is 
gone, but at least it wasn't a total loss."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#012,"[Diamant] 
I was a bit embarrassed in the moment, but 
I got to hear your deepest, truest feelings."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#013,"[Amber] 
Yeah. I'm kind of embarrassed too, but I'm glad 
I got a chance to share my appreciation."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#014,"[Amber] 
Was that it? Did I say anything else?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#015,"[Diamant] 
Now that you mention it, there was one last 
thing before you snapped out of it."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#016,"[Diamant] 
You said you thought I was ""the greatest,"" but 
trailed off before explaining why."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#017,"[Diamant] 
What were you going to say after that?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#018,"[Amber] 
Hm. That's a tough one. I do think you're really 
great, Prince Diamant...for lots of reasons."
MID_RELIANCE_B_#019,"[Amber] 
I'm not sure what the deepest, truest reason is... 
Can I think about this for a while?"
MID_RELIANCE_B_#020,"[Diamant] 
Please do."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#001,"[Diamant] 1 
[Amber] 2 

[Amber] 
Prince Diamant! Check this out. I got my hands 
on a legendary secret potion!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#002,"[Amber] 
One whiff of this baby is supposed to make you 
spill your deepest, truest feelings..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#003,"[Diamant] 
Amazing. We could use this to extract plans and 
information from enemies. Well done, Amber!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#004,"[Amber] 
Thanks! I'll go put it somewhere safe. I would 
hate for something to happ─"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#005,"[Amber] 
Waaagh!"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#006,"[Diamant] 
Oh. There goes that bottle. You OK?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#007,"[Amber] 
Ugh..."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#008,"[Amber] 
Prince Diamant... I... I must tell you how I feel."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#009,"[Diamant] 
Oh no. You must have caught some of the 
fumes from that potion."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#010,"[Amber] 
Prince Diamant... Thank you so much for 
letting me be your retainer."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#011,"[Amber] 
If it weren't for you...I'd probably be on an 
alpaca ranch."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#012,"[Amber] 
I'm so grateful to you and respect you so, 
so much. Like, really a lot."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#013,"[Amber] 
I think you're the greatest, because...b-because 
you...ugh. Ugh."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#014,"[Amber] 
Huh?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#015,"[Diamant] 
Amber?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#016,"[Amber] 
What's up, Prince Diamant? Wait, was I just 
talking a bunch? My head feels fuzzy."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#017,"[Diamant] 
You don't remember? The potion worked. 
You were pouring your heart out just now."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#018,"[Amber] 
Whoa! No way! What did I say?"
MID_RELIANCE_C_#019,"[Diamant] 
Well...it would be embarrassing to repeat, to be 
honest. Let's talk about this later."
MID_RELIANCE_C_#020,"[Amber] 
Oh. Sure. Understood. I'll, uh, talk to you later."
